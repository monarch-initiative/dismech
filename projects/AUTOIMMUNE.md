# Autoimmune Diseases Curation Project

## Overview
Comprehensive curation of autoimmune diseases for the dismech knowledge base, covering diverse autoimmune mechanisms including organ-specific, systemic, and autoinflammatory conditions.

This is an evergreen project: beyond the initial diseases, "Other" expansion categories capture related conditions that share autoimmune mechanisms and can be unfolded as curation continues.

## Progress
- **Existing (enhancement):** 9/10 (90%) - Only Antiphospholipid Syndrome remains
- **New diseases:** 20/20 (100%) ✅
- **Evidence enhancement:** 20/20 (100%) ✅ - 153 total evidence items added

## Key Autoimmune Mechanisms to Cover
1. **Antibody-mediated** - autoantibodies targeting self-antigens (e.g., anti-AChR in MG, anti-dsDNA in SLE)
2. **T cell-mediated** - autoreactive T cells attacking tissues (e.g., MS, T1D)
3. **Immune complex deposition** - circulating immune complexes causing tissue damage
4. **Complement activation** - complement-mediated tissue destruction
5. **Cytokine dysregulation** - aberrant inflammatory cytokine production
6. **Molecular mimicry** - cross-reactivity between pathogen and self-antigens
7. **Epitope spreading** - expansion of autoimmune response to additional self-antigens

## Common Autoantibodies to Document
- ANA (antinuclear antibodies)
- Anti-dsDNA
- Anti-Ro/SSA, Anti-La/SSB
- ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies)
- Anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide)
- Anti-TPO, Anti-thyroglobulin
- Anti-AChR (acetylcholine receptor)
- Anti-GAD65
