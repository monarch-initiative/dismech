# Skeletal Dysplasias Curation Project

## Overview

Comprehensive curation of skeletal dysplasias for the dismech knowledge base, prioritizing genetic skeletal disorders with **defined molecular pathogenesis** and **clear genotype-phenotype correlations**. This project focuses on disorders where:
1. Single-gene or well-defined genetic drivers are established
2. Molecular mechanisms affecting bone/cartilage development are understood
3. Phenotypic severity correlates with mutation type or location
4. Progressive skeletal manifestations are documented

The 2023 Nosology of Genetic Skeletal Disorders classifies over 770 disorders into 42 groups. This project prioritizes paradigmatic examples from key groups with therapeutic implications or strong mechanistic understanding.

## Selection Criteria

Skeletal dysplasias are prioritized based on:
- **Genetic clarity**: Single-gene mutations with defined pathogenic mechanisms
- **Pathway understanding**: Well-characterized signaling cascades (FGFR, TGF-β, Hedgehog, WNT)
- **Therapeutic relevance**: Emerging or approved targeted therapies (e.g., vosoritide for achondroplasia)
- **Educational value**: Paradigmatic examples of developmental bone biology (e.g., type II collagenopathies spectrum)

## 2026-01-30 (Project Created)

Initial project file for skeletal dysplasias curation. Structure modeled on CANCER.md project.

**Scope decisions:**
- Focus on genetic skeletal disorders per 2023 Nosology classification
- Prioritize disorders with therapeutic implications or strong mechanistic understanding
- Include allelic series (FGFR3, COL2A1, COL1A1) to demonstrate genotype-phenotype correlations
- Exclude purely metabolic bone disease covered elsewhere (osteoporosis) unless there's specific genetic overlap

**Key pathways to emphasize:**
1. FGFR3 signaling and CNP/natriuretic peptide pathway (achondroplasia therapy)
2. Collagen biosynthesis and quality control (OI, type II collagenopathies)
3. TGF-β superfamily signaling (LDS, FOP, Marfan connections)
4. Primary cilia and Hedgehog signaling (ciliopathies)
5. RANKL/OPG bone remodeling axis (sclerosing dysplasias)

**Related entries already in KB:**
- Marfan Syndrome (FBN1/TGF-β) - connects to Tier 6
- EDS (collagen) - connects to OI spectrum
- FOP (ACVR1/BMP) - Tier 6 complete
- NF1 - in KB but could enhance skeletal aspects

**Recommended curation order:**
Start with Achondroplasia as the paradigmatic FGFR3 disorder with FDA-approved therapy demonstrating mechanism-based treatment.
