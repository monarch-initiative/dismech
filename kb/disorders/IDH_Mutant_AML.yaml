name: Acute Myeloid Leukemia, IDH-Mutated
description: >-
  IDH-mutated acute myeloid leukemia is characterized by mutations in isocitrate
  dehydrogenase genes IDH1 (6-10% of AML) or IDH2 (8-12% of AML). These mutations
  confer neomorphic enzymatic activity, producing the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate
  (2-HG) instead of alpha-ketoglutarate. Elevated 2-HG inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate-
  dependent dioxygenases, causing epigenetic dysregulation and differentiation block.
  The development of targeted IDH inhibitors (ivosidenib for IDH1, enasidenib for IDH2)
  represents a paradigm of metabolic-targeted cancer therapy, inducing differentiation
  rather than cytotoxicity.

has_subtypes:
- name: IDH1-Mutated AML
  description: >-
    AML with mutations in cytoplasmic IDH1, most commonly R132H. IDH1 mutations
    occur in 6-10% of AML cases and are targetable with ivosidenib. Often
    co-occurs with NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations.
- name: IDH2-Mutated AML
  description: >-
    AML with mutations in mitochondrial IDH2, either R140Q (more common) or R172K.
    IDH2 mutations occur in 8-12% of AML cases and are targetable with enasidenib.
    R172K mutations may have different clinical features than R140Q.
pathophysiology:
- name: IDH Neomorphic Enzyme Activity
  description: >-
    Wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 convert isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the
    cytoplasm and mitochondria respectively. Mutant IDH enzymes gain neomorphic
    activity, reducing alpha-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate
    (2-HG), which accumulates to millimolar concentrations in leukemic cells.

    snippet: "Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and -2 increase the capacity of cancer cells to produce a normally scarce metabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), by several orders of magnitude."
    explanation: This abstract links IDH1/2 mutations to increased 2-HG production, supporting the neomorphic IDH activity described.

    description: Oncometabolite accumulates and inhibits alpha-KG-dependent enzymes
- name: 2-HG Accumulation and Dioxygenase Inhibition
  description: >-
    2-HG is structurally similar to alpha-ketoglutarate and competitively inhibits
    alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Key targets include TET2 DNA
    demethylases, Jumonji-domain histone demethylases, and prolyl hydroxylases.
    This disrupts normal epigenetic regulation and hypoxia responses.

    description: JmjC demethylase inhibition alters histone marks

  description: >-
    Inhibition of TET2 by 2-HG impairs the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to
    5-hydroxymethylcytosine, disrupting active DNA demethylation. This causes
    hypermethylation at gene promoters, silencing differentiation genes and
    contributing to the leukemic phenotype.

  description: >-
    2-HG inhibits Jumonji-domain histone demethylases that remove methyl groups
    from lysine residues on histones. This causes accumulation of repressive
    histone marks and altered gene expression patterns contributing to
    leukemogenesis.

  description: >-
    The combined epigenetic effects of 2-HG on DNA methylation and histone
    modifications block normal myeloid differentiation, maintaining leukemic
    cells in an immature blast state. IDH inhibitors can overcome this block,
    inducing differentiation of leukemic blasts.
