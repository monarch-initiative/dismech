description: >-
  KRAS G12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a molecularly-defined lung
  cancer subtype driven by the KRAS G12C point mutation. This mutation accounts for
  approximately 13% of NSCLC and was historically considered undruggable until the
  development of covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors. The G12C mutation substitutes cysteine
  for glycine at codon 12, creating a unique druggable pocket in the GDP-bound inactive
  state. Sotorasib and adagrasib represent the first approved targeted therapies for
  KRAS-mutant cancers, a breakthrough after decades of failed attempts to target RAS.

    The majority of KRAS G12C NSCLC presents as adenocarcinoma histology.

  description: >-
    Co-occurring STK11/LKB1 inactivation is common (~20-30%) and associated with
    worse prognosis and reduced immunotherapy response. May still respond to
    KRAS G12C inhibitors.

  description: >-
    Co-occurring KEAP1 mutations (~15-20%) are associated with worse outcomes
    and may confer resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors.
pathophysiology:
- name: KRAS G12C Oncogenic Mutation
  description: >-
    The KRAS G12C mutation substitutes cysteine for glycine at codon 12, impairing
    GTPase activity and trapping KRAS in the active GTP-bound state. However, unlike
    other KRAS mutations, G12C retains some GTPase activity, cycling between active
    (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states. This cycling creates a therapeutic
    window for covalent inhibitors that bind the mutant cysteine in the GDP-bound state.

    snippet: The KRAS glycine-to-cysteine mutation (G12C) composes approximately 44% of KRAS mutations in non-small cell lung cancer, with mutant KRasG12C present in approximately 13% of all patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
    explanation: This abstract explicitly describes the KRAS G12C substitution and its frequency in NSCLC, supporting the oncogenic mutation context.

  description: >-
    Resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors develops through multiple mechanisms:
    secondary KRAS mutations (Y96C, R68S, H95D/Q/R), KRAS amplification, bypass
    pathway activation (MET, EGFR, FGFR, PI3K), and histologic transformation.
    Adaptive feedback through RTK reactivation (EGFR, FGFR, SHP2) is common.

  notes: >-
    KRAS mutation testing is part of standard molecular profiling for advanced
    NSCLC. Methods include PCR-based assays and next-generation sequencing.
    G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC (~40% of KRAS mutations).
    Testing should distinguish G12C from other KRAS mutations (G12D, G12V)
    which are not targetable with current approved agents.
