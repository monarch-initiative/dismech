description: >-
  ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a molecularly-defined lung
  cancer subtype driven by chromosomal rearrangements involving the ROS1 proto-oncogene.
  ROS1 fusions occur in approximately 1-2% of NSCLC and share clinical and molecular
  similarities with ALK-rearranged tumors. Like ALK, ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase
  that becomes constitutively activated when fused to various partner genes. ROS1-positive
  NSCLC occurs predominantly in younger patients with minimal or no smoking history
  and responds to ALK/ROS1 inhibitors such as crizotinib, entrectinib, and lorlatinib.

has_subtypes:
- name: CD74-ROS1 NSCLC
  description: >-
    CD74-ROS1 is the most common ROS1 fusion partner (~40-45%), resulting from a
    chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 5 and 6. CD74 provides the
    dimerization domain for constitutive ROS1 activation.
- name: EZR-ROS1 NSCLC
  description: >-
    EZR-ROS1 fusion accounts for approximately 15% of ROS1 rearrangements. The
    ezrin protein provides membrane localization and dimerization for ROS1 activation.
- name: SDC4-ROS1 NSCLC
  description: >-
    SDC4-ROS1 (syndecan-4) fusion is another common variant, found in approximately
    10% of ROS1-positive cases.
pathophysiology:
- name: ROS1 Gene Rearrangement
  description: >-
    ROS1 rearrangements result from chromosomal translocations that fuse the ROS1
    kinase domain (6q22) to an N-terminal partner gene. The partner provides a
    dimerization domain, causing constitutive ROS1 kinase activation independent
    of ligand. ROS1 shares ~49% amino acid identity with ALK in the kinase domain,
    explaining cross-sensitivity to ALK inhibitors.

    explanation: This abstract establishes that ROS1 fusions define a small NSCLC subset, supporting the ROS1 gene rearrangement mechanism.

    description: Fusion protein is constitutively active
- name: Constitutive ROS1 Signaling
  description: >-
    ROS1 fusion proteins are constitutively dimerized and auto-phosphorylated,
    activating downstream signaling including RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and JAK-STAT3
    pathways. These pathways promote cell proliferation, survival, and migration.
    ROS1 shares significant kinase domain homology with ALK.

    description: Tumor survival dependent on ROS1 activity
- name: Oncogene Addiction
  description: >-
    ROS1-rearranged tumors exhibit oncogene addiction, becoming dependent on
    continued ROS1 signaling for survival. ROS1 inhibition leads to dramatic
    tumor responses, often within days to weeks of starting therapy.

- name: ROS1 Inhibitor Resistance
  description: >-
    Resistance to ROS1 inhibitors develops through ROS1-dependent mechanisms
    (secondary mutations like G2032R, D2033N, L2026M) or ROS1-independent bypass
    pathways (MET amplification, KRAS mutations, EGFR activation). The G2032R
    solvent front mutation is the most common and confers resistance to crizotinib.

    ROS1 testing is required for all advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Methods include
    FISH, immunohistochemistry (screening), and next-generation sequencing (identifies
    fusion partner). ROS1 fusions are mutually exclusive with EGFR, ALK, and KRAS
    alterations.
