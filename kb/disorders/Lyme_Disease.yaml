name: Lyme Disease
category: Infectious
description: >
  Lyme disease is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi
  and related Borrelia species. It is the most common vector-borne disease in
  North America and Europe. The disease progresses through stages: early localized
  (erythema migrans), early disseminated (multiple erythema migrans, neurological,
  cardiac involvement), and late disseminated (arthritis, chronic neurological).
  Early antibiotic treatment is highly effective, while delayed treatment may lead
  to persistent symptoms.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Spirochete Invasion and Dissemination
    description: >
      Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted through Ixodes tick bites. The spirochete
      disseminates from the skin through the bloodstream to multiple organ systems
      including joints, heart, and nervous system. Surface adhesins like BBK32 and
      decorin-binding proteins (DbpA/DbpB) facilitate tissue colonization.

        snippet: "The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease range from a localized infection, for example, erythema migrans (EM) to a disseminated neurological or rheumatological infection, cardiac involvement, or even chronic disease."
        explanation: Epidemiologic series shows Borrelia disseminates beyond skin to neurologic, rheumatologic, and cardiac sites.

    description: >
      The host immune response to Borrelia antigens contributes to tissue damage.
      Spirochetal lipoproteins and peptidoglycan trigger robust innate immune
      activation with production of IL-6, IL-8, TNF, and chemokines (CCL3/CCL4).
      Persistent inflammation in joints may continue even after spirochete clearance.
