name: Akinetopsia
category: Complex
description: >-
  Akinetopsia (motion blindness) is a rare visual cortical disorder characterized
  by impaired perception of visual motion, with moving objects perceived as
  disjointed jumps or freeze-frames. The condition is linked to dysfunction of
  motion-processing regions in the visual cortex, especially area V5/MT.
