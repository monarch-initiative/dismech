description: Camptodactyly is a congenital or acquired condition characterized by permanent flexion contracture of one or more fingers, most commonly affecting the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. It can occur as an isolated finding or as part of syndromic conditions including distal arthrogryposis and CACP syndrome.

notes: Camptodactyly is a condition primarily affecting the hand, marked by a permanent flexion deformity, most commonly seen in the little finger. While it can be present at birth, it often becomes more pronounced during growth periods. The condition can be isolated or part of syndromic conditions including distal arthrogryposis (sarcomeric gene variants), CACP syndrome (PRG4 mutations), or congenital contractural arachnodactyly (FBN2 mutations). The fundamental pathomechanism involves reduced fetal movement leading to connective tissue remodeling and joint contracture.
