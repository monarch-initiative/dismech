description: Camptodactyly is a congenital or acquired condition characterized by permanent
  flexion contracture of one or more fingers, most commonly affecting the proximal
  interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. It can occur as an isolated finding or
  as part of syndromic conditions including distal arthrogryposis and CACP syndrome.

pathophysiology:

  description: Reduced fetal movement during development leads to connective tissue
    accumulation and shortening around joints, resulting in fixed flexion deformities
    at birth. This is the fundamental pathomechanism across arthrogryposis types.

  description: Pathogenic variants in sarcomeric proteins (TNNT3, TNNI2, TPM2, MYH3, ACTC1)

- name: PRG4/Lubricin Deficiency
  description: Loss of PRG4 function abolishes surface lubrication and anti-adhesive
    properties of synovial and cartilage interfaces, provoking non-inflammatory
    arthropathy, synovial hyperplasia, and progressive joint stiffness. Camptodactyly
    is often the earliest manifestation in CACP syndrome.

notes: Camptodactyly is a condition primarily affecting the hand, marked by a permanent
  flexion deformity, most commonly seen in the little finger. While it can be present
  at birth, it often becomes more pronounced during growth periods. The condition
  can be isolated or part of syndromic conditions including distal arthrogryposis
  (sarcomeric gene variants), CACP syndrome (PRG4 mutations), or congenital contractural
  arachnodactyly (FBN2 mutations). The fundamental pathomechanism involves reduced
  fetal movement leading to connective tissue remodeling and joint contracture.
