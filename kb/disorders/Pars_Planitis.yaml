    snippet: "Key exclusions included: 1) multiple sclerosis, 2) sarcoidosis, and 3) syphilis."
    explanation: The SUN criteria treat multiple sclerosis as an exclusion, underscoring the need to differentiate it from idiopathic pars planitis.
- name: Sarcoidosis-Associated Intermediate Uveitis with Vasoproliferative Tumor
  description: Sarcoidosis-related intermediate uveitis can produce peripheral vasoproliferative tumors and exudative detachment, mimicking complicated pars planitis.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Systemic sarcoidosis history with granulomatous uveitis plus a peripheral retinal vascular mass points to sarcoid-associated intermediate uveitis rather than idiopathic pars planitis.
  - Exudative retinal detachment arising from a vasoproliferative tumor that regresses with combined steroid-sparing immunosuppression, vitrectomy, and tumor-directed cryotherapy distinguishes this entity.

    snippet: "She had active vitritis, and a peripheral retinal vascular mass was noted in the superotemporal periphery. The mass was associated with ERD involving the posterior pole."
    explanation: Highlights sarcoidosis-associated intermediate uveitis complicated by vasoproliferative tumor and exudative detachment, requiring differentiation from idiopathic pars planitis.
