description: >-
  Empty Nose Syndrome (ENS) is a debilitating iatrogenic condition that develops
  following surgical reduction or resection of the nasal turbinates, most commonly
  the inferior turbinates. Despite having objectively patent nasal airways, patients
  experience paradoxical nasal obstruction, dyspnea, nasal dryness, and crusting.
  The loss of turbinate tissue disrupts normal nasal airflow patterns, mucociliary
  clearance, and sensory feedback, resulting in a subjective sensation of
  suffocation. The condition is frequently associated with significant psychological
  morbidity including depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance.

- name: Turbinate tissue loss from surgical resection
  description: >-
    Surgical reduction or total resection of the nasal turbinates, most commonly
    the inferior turbinates and sometimes the middle turbinates, removes the
    mucosal and bony tissue that normally modulates nasal airflow. This can
    result from turbinectomy, aggressive turbinoplasty, or submucosal
    resection performed for chronic nasal obstruction or rhinitis.

  description: >-
    The turbinates normally create resistance and direct laminar airflow through
    the nasal cavity. Their removal results in abnormally wide nasal passages
    with turbulent airflow patterns and paradoxical redistribution of airflow
    away from the inferior meatus toward the middle meatus, reducing mucosal
    wall shear stress and sensory stimulation.

  description: >-
    Turbinate mucosa is rich in goblet cells that produce the mucus blanket
    essential for mucociliary clearance. Surgical removal of turbinate tissue
    reduces goblet cell density and disrupts the mucociliary escalator,
    impairing particle trapping and pathogen removal. Histopathology shows
    goblet cell metaplasia, indicating mucosal remodeling that alters normal
    secretory function and mucociliary transport.

  description: >-
    The nasal turbinates play a critical role in warming, humidifying, and
    filtering inspired air through their rich vascular supply and seromucinous
    glands. Surgical resection of turbinate tissue reduces the mucosal surface
    area and submucosal gland density available for conditioning inspired air,
    leading to mucosal dryness, crusting, and nasal discomfort. Histopathology
    demonstrates squamous metaplasia, submucosal fibrosis, and reduced
    submucosal gland number.

  description: >-
    The central clinical paradox of ENS: patients with wide-open nasal passages
    experience subjective nasal obstruction and air hunger. This results from
    the convergence of disrupted airflow dynamics and trigeminal neurosensory
    dysfunction, where inadequate mucosal cooling and mechanosensory
    stimulation are interpreted by the brain as inadequate ventilation.
    The sensation of suffocation causes significant distress and
    psychological morbidity.
