pathophysiology:
- name: Atrial Electrical Remodeling
  description: >
    Rapid atrial rates cause shortening of atrial refractory period and
    loss of rate adaptation, promoting AF maintenance. AF begets AF.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "NOX2 inhibition normalized atrial action potential duration and abrogated obesity-mediated ion channel remodeling with reduced AF burden."
    explanation: This demonstrates that electrical remodeling including altered action potential duration is a key pathophysiological mechanism in AF.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that affects the left atrium, cardiac function, and the patients' survival rate."
    explanation: Confirms AF affects atrial electrical function and is influenced by electrophysiological mechanisms.
- name: Atrial Structural Remodeling
  description: >
    Atrial fibrosis and dilation create substrate for AF maintenance.
    Fibrosis disrupts normal conduction and creates reentrant circuits.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "it is influenced by a complex interplay of autoimmune, inflammatory, and electrophysiological mechanisms."
    explanation: Inflammatory mechanisms contribute to structural remodeling including fibrosis that maintains AF substrate.
- name: Pulmonary Vein Triggers
  description: >
    Ectopic beats originating from pulmonary vein myocardial sleeves
    commonly trigger AF episodes. These foci have distinct electrophysiology.
- name: Atrial Thrombus Formation
  description: >
    Loss of atrial contraction leads to blood stasis, particularly in
    the left atrial appendage, promoting thrombus formation and embolic stroke.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38255832
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that affects the left atrium, cardiac function, and the patients' survival rate."
    explanation: AF affects cardiac function including atrial contraction, which contributes to thromboembolism risk and impacts patient survival.

    snippet: "Unbiased transcriptomics analysis revealed that NOX2 mediates atrial remodeling in obesity-mediated AF in DIO mice, PA-treated hiPSC-aCMs, and human atrial tissue from obese individuals by upregulation of paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2)."
    explanation: Demonstrates PITX2 plays a mechanistic role in AF pathophysiology, supporting its genetic association with AF risk.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In patients with cardiovascular conditions, AF PRS is a strong independent predictor of incident AF that provides complementary predictive value when added to a validated clinical risk score and NT-proBNP."
    explanation: Polygenic risk score including PITX2 and other loci significantly predicts AF risk, validating genetic contributions to AF susceptibility.
