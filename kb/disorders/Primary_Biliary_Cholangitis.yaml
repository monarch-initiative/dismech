description: >-
  A chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by progressive destruction
  of small intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, fibrosis, and
  eventually cirrhosis. Highly associated with anti-mitochondrial antibodies
  (AMA) targeting pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
pathophysiology:
- name: Anti-Mitochondrial Antibody Response
  description: >-
    Autoantibodies against the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
    (PDC-E2) are highly specific for PBC. These antibodies may directly
    contribute to biliary epithelial cell damage through immune complex
    formation and complement activation.

      Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune hepatobiliary disease
      characterized by immune mediated destruction of the intrahepatic small bile
      ducts and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs). The mitochondrial
      autoantigens have been identified as the E2 subunits of the 2-oxo-acid
      dehydrogenase complex, including the E2 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase,
      branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
      complex, E3 binding protein and PDC E1 alpha subunit.
    explanation: >-
      This paper confirms that AMAs targeting PDC-E2 and related E2 subunits are
      characteristic of PBC and are associated with immune-mediated bile duct destruction.

      Although the pathogenesis of the disease is multifactorial, there is a consensus
      that individuals with a genetic predisposition develop the disease in the
      presence of specific environmental triggers. A dysbiosis of intestinal
      microbiota is increasingly considered among the potential pathogenic factors.
    explanation: >-
      This review highlights the multifactorial pathogenesis of PBC, including
      genetic predisposition and environmental triggers that lead to AMA production
      and disease development.
- name: Biliary Epithelial Cell Targeting
  description: >-
    CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrate portal tracts and specifically target
    small bile duct epithelial cells. Aberrant PDC-E2 expression on apoptotic
    cholangiocytes may initiate the autoimmune response.

    snippet: >-
      In vitro cholangiocyte cytotoxicity assays demonstrated significantly
      increased numbers of cytotoxic hepatic dnTGFβRII KLRG1(+) CD8 cells
      compared to B6. Protection from disease by B6 Tregs was associated with
      elimination of hepatic dnTGFβRII CD8 mediated cholangiocyte cytotoxicity.
      These results emphasize that autoimmune cholangitis requires defects in
      both the T effector and regulatory compartments.
    explanation: >-
      This study demonstrates that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells directly target and
      destroy cholangiocytes in experimental PBC, supporting the role of T cell-
      mediated cytotoxicity in bile duct epithelial cell destruction.

      Cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts, are the main
      target of a dysregulated immune response, and cholangiocytes senescence
      has been recognized as a driving mechanism, leading to impaired bile duct
      function, in disease progression.
    explanation: >-
      This review confirms that cholangiocytes are the primary cellular targets
      of immune attack in PBC, with senescent cholangiocytes driving disease
      progression through impaired bile duct function.
- name: Progressive Ductopenia and Cholestasis
  description: >-
    Destruction of bile ducts leads to ductopenia, impaired bile flow, and
    accumulation of toxic bile acids. Retained bile acids cause further
    hepatocyte damage and promote fibrosis.

      In recent years, several studies have shown that, in case of a change in
      gut bacterial homeostasis or impairment of intestinal barrier functions,
      cholangiocytes, which are the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts,
      activate innate immune responses against gut-derived microorganisms or
      bacterial products that reach the liver via enterohepatic circulation.
      Intestinal dysbiosis or impaired intestinal barrier functions cause
      cholangiocytes to be exposed to an increasing amount of microorganisms
      that can reactivate inflammatory responses, thus inducing the onset of
      liver fibrosis.
    explanation: >-
      This review demonstrates that cholangiocyte injury and bile duct destruction
      in PBC are promoted by gut-derived bacterial products reaching the liver,
      which trigger inflammatory responses that induce liver fibrosis and progressive
      disease.

      Bile acids are also recognized as playing an important role, both in disease
      development and therapy. Thus, while bile acid-based therapies, specifically
      ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid, have been the cornerstone of
      therapy in PBC, novel therapeutic approaches have been developed in recent years.
    explanation: >-
      This review highlights the central role of bile acids in PBC pathogenesis,
      noting that bile acid accumulation contributes to disease progression and
      that bile acid modulation is a key therapeutic strategy.
