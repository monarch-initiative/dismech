description: >
  Chickenpox (varicella) is a highly contagious acute primary infection caused
  by varicella-zoster virus (VZV, human herpesvirus 3). It is characterized by
  a generalized pruritic vesicular rash, fever, and malaise. Transmission occurs
  via respiratory droplets and direct contact with vesicle fluid. After primary
  infection, VZV establishes lifelong latency in sensory ganglia and may
  reactivate as herpes zoster (shingles). While typically self-limited in
  immunocompetent children, chickenpox can cause serious complications including
  pneumonia, encephalitis, and bacterial superinfection, particularly in
  neonates, adults, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. Universal
  childhood vaccination has dramatically reduced incidence, morbidity, and
  mortality in countries with established vaccination programs.

  description: >
    VZV (human herpesvirus 3) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus with a biphasic
    lifecycle comprising lytic infection in permissive tissues and latent infection
    in sensory ganglia. VZV encodes immune evasion proteins (ORF61p, ORF47p,
    IE-62) that antagonize type I interferon signaling, and envelope glycoproteins
    (gB, gE, gH/gL, gI, gM) that mediate cell-to-cell spread and skin tropism.
    During latency, transcription is restricted to VZV latency-associated
    transcripts (VLTs) and VLT-ORF63 fusion transcripts.

transmission:
- name: Airborne/respiratory droplet transmission
  description: >
    VZV is transmitted primarily via the airborne route through inhalation of
    infectious aerosols or respiratory droplets from an infected individual.
    The virus is well-recognized as an airborne pathogen alongside measles and
    tuberculosis, requiring airborne infection isolation precautions (N95
    respirators) in healthcare settings. The infectious period extends from
    1-2 days before rash onset until all lesions have crusted over.

- name: T-cell-associated viremia and systemic dissemination
  description: >
    Following initial replication in lymphoid tissue, VZV disseminates via
    cell-associated viremia in T lymphocytes. VZV DNA is detectable in
    T-lymphocytes as early as 8-10 days prior to rash onset. The secondary
    viremia seeds the virus to the skin and mucous membranes, producing the
    characteristic vesicular exanthem. Concurrent innate immune evasion
    through IRF3 antagonism (by ORF61p, ORF47p, and IE-62) and suppression
    of type I interferon signaling facilitates systemic spread.

notes: >
  VZV employs multiple immune evasion strategies: ORF61p induces IRF3
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation; ORF47p blocks IRF3 Ser396
  phosphorylation; and IE-62 inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation in a
  TBK1-independent fashion (PMID:39051773). Non-infectious small
  extracellular vesicles from VZV-infected sensory neurons can suppress
  type I interferon responses in recipient cells (PMID:39051773). VZV
  also impairs MAIT cell polyfunctional effector responses, including
  activation, cytokine production, and cytolytic potential
  (PMID:39110717). VZV downregulates MHC-I and MHC-II expression and
  NK-cell activating ligands. During latency, VZV circular RNAs
  (circVLTs) modulate antiviral drug sensitivity (PMID:38858365).
  Complications of chickenpox include varicella pneumonia, encephalitis,
  cerebellar ataxia, secondary bacterial skin superinfection, and rarely,
  purpura fulminans and necrotizing fasciitis.
