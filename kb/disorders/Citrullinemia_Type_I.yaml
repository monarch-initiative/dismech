description: 'Citrullinemia type I (CTLN1) is an autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants
  in ASS1, encoding argininosuccinate synthase 1. ASS1 deficiency blocks the condensation of citrulline and aspartate to form
  argininosuccinate (the third enzymatic step of the urea cycle), impairing hepatic nitrogen disposal. This leads to hyperammonemia,
  markedly elevated plasma citrulline, low plasma arginine, and orotic aciduria. The clinical spectrum ranges from a severe
  neonatal-onset ("classic") form with life-threatening hyperammonemic crises to milder late-onset forms, pregnancy/postpartum-triggered
  presentations, and asymptomatic individuals. Acute hyperammonemia produces neurotoxicity through astrocyte glutamine accumulation,
  osmotic swelling, and cerebral edema. Long-term outcomes depend on residual enzyme activity, rapidity of diagnosis, and
  prevention of hyperammonemic events.

pathophysiology:
- name: Impaired hepatic ureagenesis due to ASS1 deficiency
  description: 'ASS1 deficiency disrupts the urea cycle by blocking conversion of citrulline and aspartate to argininosuccinate
    in periportal hepatocytes. This leads to accumulation of upstream substrates (citrulline, ammonia) and failure to detoxify
    nitrogen, causing hyperammonemia. The severity of the metabolic block correlates with residual ASS1 enzyme activity, which
    is determined by the specific pathogenic variants.

- name: Nitrogen scavenger therapy
  description: 'Sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate, or glycerol phenylbutyrate are used to promote alternative nitrogen
    disposal pathways. These agents conjugate with glycine or glutamine to form hippurate or phenylacetylglutamine, which
    are renally excreted, thus bypassing the blocked urea cycle.

  description: 'Emergency management of hyperammonemic crises includes cessation of protein intake (maximum 48 hours), high-calorie

    snippet: Without prompt intervention, hyperammonemia and the accumulation of other toxic metabolites (e.g., glutamine)
      result in increased ICP, increased neuromuscular tone, spasticity, ankle clonus, seizures, loss of consciousness, and
      death.

- name: Liver transplantation
  description: 'Liver transplantation is the only established curative intervention at the metabolic level for CTLN1. It provides
    metabolic stability by restoring hepatic ASS1 activity, preventing further hyperammonemic events, and allowing liberalization
    of protein intake. Five-year patient survival exceeds 90%. However, pre-existing neurocognitive impairment does not improve
    after transplantation.

    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: Citrullinemia type I (CTLN1) presents as a spectrum that includes a neonatal acute form (the "classic" form),
      a milder late-onset form (the "non-classic" form), a form in which women have onset of symptoms at pregnancy or post
      partum, and a form without symptoms or hyperammonemia.
    explanation: GeneReviews describes the full clinical spectrum of CTLN1 presentations.
  notes: 'Classic neonatal-onset CTLN1 presents within the first days of life with progressive lethargy, poor feeding, vomiting,
    and hyperammonemic encephalopathy that can rapidly progress to coma and death without treatment. Late-onset forms present
    with intermittent hyperammonemia, developmental delay, and neurocognitive impairment. A pregnancy/postpartum-triggered
    form can present in women without prior symptoms. Long-term outcomes are determined by severity and number of hyperammonemic
    events, with early-onset cases having 35.8% mortality versus 7.1% in late-onset cases. Neurological impairment occurs
    in 44% of UCD patients overall. Liver transplantation can stabilize metabolism but does not reverse pre-existing brain
    injury.

notes: 'CTLN1 is the second most common urea cycle disorder. The Alshaya et al. 2018 review (DOI:10.1007/s40138-018-0174-5)
  provides additional detail on the astrocyte glutamine-osmotic injury mechanism but was not indexed in PubMed. The GeneReviews
  entry (PMID:20301631) serves as a comprehensive clinical reference for classic and non-classic CTLN1 management.
