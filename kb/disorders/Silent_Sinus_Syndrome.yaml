pathophysiology:
- name: Ostiomeatal Complex Obstruction
  description: >-
    Obstruction of the maxillary sinus ostium leads to impaired ventilation
    and drainage, creating negative intrasinus pressure. The complete
    obstruction results in gas resorption similar to middle ear atelectasis
    due to Eustachian tube dysfunction.

    snippet: >-
      Obstruction of the maxillary ostium appears to play a critical role
      in the development of SSS.
    explanation: >-
      The reference explicitly states that ostium obstruction plays a
      critical role in SSS development.
  downstream:
  - target: Maxillary Sinus Atelectasis
    description: >-
      Ostial obstruction leads to gas resorption and negative pressure,
      causing progressive sinus wall collapse.
- name: Maxillary Sinus Atelectasis
  description: >-
    Progressive collapse and inward retraction of the maxillary sinus walls
    due to chronic negative pressure within the sinus cavity. The gas
    resorption causes negative pressure, which leads to osteopenia, bone
    remodeling, and sinus wall retraction.

  downstream:
  - target: Orbital Floor Resorption and Descent
    description: >-
      Chronic negative pressure and sinus wall collapse causes the orbital
      floor (maxillary sinus roof) to descend into the atelectatic sinus.
- name: Orbital Floor Resorption and Descent
  description: >-
    The weakened and retracting maxillary sinus roof (which forms the orbital
    floor) progressively descends into the atelectatic sinus. Bone resorption
    and remodeling increases orbital volume and allows the orbital contents
    to herniate inferiorly, causing enophthalmos and hypoglobus.

notes: >-
  Silent sinus syndrome is characterized by the insidious, painless development
  of enophthalmos without prior history of sinus symptoms. The "silent" nature
  refers to the absence of typical sinonasal complaints (nasal obstruction,
  discharge, facial pain) despite significant maxillary sinus pathology. Most
  cases are unilateral and affect individuals in the fourth decade of life
  (average age 36 years, range 29-46 years). The condition was first described
  by Soparkar et al. in 1994. For reasons that are unclear, the sinus component
  of the disease remains asymptomatic and is discovered only after thorough
  evaluation of the enophthalmos.
