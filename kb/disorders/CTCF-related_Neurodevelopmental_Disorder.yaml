description: >
  CTCF-related neurodevelopmental disorder is a rare Mendelian condition caused by
  heterozygous de novo mutations in the CTCF gene, which encodes a critical chromatin
  architecture protein. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is an 11-zinc finger transcription
  factor essential for establishing topologically associating domains (TADs) and
  regulating three-dimensional genome structure. Affected individuals typically present
  with intellectual disability of variable severity, developmental delay, feeding
  difficulties, behavioral abnormalities, and variable dysmorphic features. The
  pathophysiology involves haploinsufficiency leading to disrupted chromatin looping,
  aberrant enhancer-promoter interactions, and dysregulation of neurodevelopmental
  genes.

- name: CTCF Haploinsufficiency
  description: >
    Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in CTCF lead to reduced functional
    CTCF protein levels, disrupting its role as a master regulator of chromatin
    architecture. CTCF is essential for establishing insulator elements that
    define topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Both frameshift
    and missense variants (affecting zinc finger domains) result in functional
    haploinsufficiency through nonsense-mediated decay or impaired DNA binding.

  description: >
    Reduced CTCF function leads to aberrant chromatin looping and disrupted
    TAD boundaries, causing inappropriate enhancer-promoter interactions.
    CTCF normally mediates formation of chromatin loops that define TADs,
    and its depletion causes blurred domain boundaries and altered
    three-dimensional genome structure. The R567W mutation specifically
    affects CTCF binding to peripheral motifs, causing local chromatin
    structure alterations particularly at the clustered protocadherin locus.

  CTCF-related neurodevelopmental disorder was first characterized in 2013 through
  exome sequencing identifying de novo CTCF mutations in individuals with unexplained
  intellectual disability. The phenotypic spectrum is highly variable, ranging from
  mild developmental delay with normal IQ to severe intellectual disability. The
  disorder exemplifies how disruption of chromatin architecture proteins causes
  neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Drosophila studies have confirmed that CTCF
  dosage is critical for learning and memory processes, providing insight into
  the cognitive phenotype. Also known as Mental Retardation, Autosomal Dominant 21
  (MRD21, MIM 615502).
