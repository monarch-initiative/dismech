    label: age-related macular degeneration
has_subtypes:
- name: Dry AMD (Atrophic)
  description: Gradual degeneration with drusen and geographic atrophy, 85-90% of cases.
- name: Wet AMD (Neovascular)
  description: Abnormal blood vessel growth, causes rapid vision loss, 10-15% of cases.
pathophysiology:
- name: Drusen Accumulation
  description: >
    Lipid and protein deposits accumulate between retinal pigment
    epithelium and Bruch's membrane. Drusen indicate RPE dysfunction
    and are early hallmark of AMD.
  cell_types:
  - preferred_term: Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cell

      id: CL:0002586
      label: retinal pigment epithelial cell
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38731137
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Drusen comprise a yellowish white substance that accumulates typically under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and their constituents are lipids, complement, amyloid, crystallin, and others."
    explanation: This confirms that drusen are lipid and protein deposits under the RPE with characteristic composition including lipids, complement proteins, and other components.
- name: RPE Dysfunction and Loss
  description: >
    Oxidative stress, lipofuscin accumulation, and inflammation
    damage RPE cells. RPE loss leads to photoreceptor death and
    geographic atrophy in dry AMD.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Oxidative Stress Response
    term:
      id: GO:0006979
      label: response to oxidative stress
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38193957
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "AMD occurs when extracellular deposits accumulate in the outer retina, ultimately leading to photoreceptor degeneration and loss of central vision. The late stages of AMD are characterized by outer retinal atrophy, termed geographic atrophy, or neovascularization associated with subretinal and/or intraretinal exudation, termed exudative neovascular AMD."
    explanation: This describes the progression from deposit accumulation to photoreceptor degeneration and atrophy, supporting the role of RPE dysfunction in geographic atrophy development.
- name: Complement Dysregulation
  description: >
    Excessive complement activation in the macula contributes to
    chronic inflammation and tissue damage. CFH variants are major
    genetic risk factor.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Complement Activation
    term:
      id: GO:0006956
      label: complement activation
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38690727
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Careful regulation of the complement system is critical for enabling complement proteins to titrate immune defense while also preventing collateral tissue damage from poorly controlled inflammation. In the eye, this balance between complement activity and inhibition is crucial, as a low level of basal complement activity is necessary to support ocular immune privilege, a prerequisite for maintaining vision."
    explanation: This explains the importance of complement regulation in the eye and how dysregulation leads to inflammation and tissue damage, which is central to AMD pathogenesis.
  - reference: PMID:38690727
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Complement dysregulation has been implicated in many ocular diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD)."
    explanation: Direct confirmation that complement dysregulation is implicated in AMD pathogenesis.
- name: Choroidal Neovascularization
  description: >
    In wet AMD, VEGF-driven abnormal blood vessel growth from choroid
    invades through Bruch's membrane. These fragile vessels leak and
    bleed, causing rapid vision loss.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Angiogenesis
    term:
      id: GO:0001525
      label: angiogenesis
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38193957
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "In exudative neovascular AMD, 94.6% of patients receiving monthly intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections experience less than a 15-letter visual acuity loss after 12 months compared with 62.2% receiving sham treatment."
    explanation: The effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy demonstrates that VEGF-driven angiogenesis is the key pathophysiological mechanism in neovascular AMD.
