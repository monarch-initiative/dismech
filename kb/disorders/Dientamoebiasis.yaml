category: Infectious Disease
description: >-
  Dientamoebiasis is a parasitic infection of the large intestine caused by the
  protozoan Dientamoeba fragilis. It is commonly reported worldwide in association
  with gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and flatulence,
  though its pathogenicity remains debated. Transmission is thought to occur via the
  fecal-oral route, possibly facilitated by helminth eggs such as those of
  Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm). Clinical outcomes range from asymptomatic
  carriage to chronic gastrointestinal illness.

  description: >-
    A trichomonad protozoan parasite that inhabits the human large intestine.
    Despite its name suggesting an amoeboid nature, it is classified as a flagellate
    closely related to Histomonas and Trichomonas. It exists predominantly in a
    trophozoite form; a cyst stage has been described in rodent models, with
    transmission electron microscopy revealing a double-layered cyst wall
    surrounding an encysted parasite containing hydrogenosomes, endoplasmic
    reticulum, nuclei, and internal flagellar axonemes. Trophozoites are
    vulnerable to highly acidic conditions, suggesting they cannot survive
    gastric transit without encystment.

      Although originally described as an amoeboid organism, it has been
      reclassified as a flagellate, on the basis of a number of electron microscopic
      and immunological findings. Except for its lack of a flagellum, D. fragilis
      closely resembles Histomonas and Trichomonas.

      These studies of cysts showed a clear cyst wall surrounding an encysted
      parasite. The cyst wall was double layered with an outer fibrillar layer and
      an inner layer enclosing the parasite. Hydrogenosomes, endoplasmic reticulum
      and nuclei were present in the cysts. Pelta-axostyle structures, costa and
      axonemes were identifiable and internal flagellar axonemes were present.
    explanation: >-
      Transmission electron microscopy of D. fragilis cysts obtained from mice
      and rats reveals detailed ultrastructure including a double-layered cyst wall
      and preserved organelles, providing evidence for the cyst life cycle stage.
transmission:
- name: Co-transmission via Enterobius vermicularis eggs
  description: >-
    A co-transmission hypothesis proposes that D. fragilis is carried within the
    eggs of the pinworm Enterobius vermicularis. D. fragilis DNA has been detected
    inside surface-sterilized E. vermicularis eggs from co-infected patients,
    and the higher-than-expected coincidence of D. fragilis and pinworm infections
    supports this mechanism. Because trophozoites are vulnerable to gastric acid
    and a human cyst stage has not been demonstrated, helminth egg vectoring
    provides a plausible route for surviving transit through the upper GI tract.

      we detected D. fragilis DNA in 18 (85%) of 21 samples of E. vermicularis
      eggs collected from patients harbouring D. fragilis in faeces. This finding
      supports the hypothesis that E. vermicularis may have an important role in
      the transmission of D. fragilis.
    explanation: >-
      Detection of D. fragilis DNA within the majority of E. vermicularis eggs
      from co-infected patients supports the pinworm co-transmission hypothesis.

      a resistant cyst stage has not been demonstrated and it is unlikely that
      its trophozoites can survive successfully outside the human host. As a
      consequence of its higher than anticipated coincidence of infection with
      Enterobius vermicularis, transmission may occur via ova of this pinworm.

- name: Direct fecal-oral transmission via cysts
  description: >-
    Direct person-to-person fecal-oral transmission has been proposed as an
    alternative to the pinworm co-transmission hypothesis. The identification
    of a cyst stage of D. fragilis in rodents infected with a human isolate
    implies a life cycle similar to most other intestinal protistan parasites,
    where environmentally resistant cysts are shed in feces and ingested by a
    new host. The cyst wall may protect the organism during gastric transit,
    though this stage has not yet been confirmed in human infections.

      Detection of D. fragilis DNA inside Enterobius vermicularis eggs agrees

      fragilis in the stool of rodents infected with a human isolate has also been
      reported, and this implies a life cycle similar to those of most other
      intestinal protistan parasites.

pathophysiology:
- name: Trophozoite colonization of colonic mucosa
  description: >-
    Dientamoeba fragilis trophozoites establish residence in the lumen and on
    the mucosal surface of the large intestine. The organism lacks a well-established
    cyst stage in humans, so trophozoites represent the primary parasitic form
    in the colon. Colonization may be facilitated by ingestion of contaminated
    pinworm eggs harboring viable D. fragilis organisms.

  notes: >-
    The pathogenicity of D. fragilis remains debated. Some case-control studies
    find no significant difference in clinical signs between D. fragilis-positive
    and -negative patients regardless of parasite load, suggesting it may be a
    commensal of the digestive tract. Others demonstrate a dose-dependent
    association between parasite load and symptoms. Context-dependent factors
    such as co-infections (especially Blastocystis sp.), host immunity, and
    microbiome composition may determine clinical outcomes.
- name: Altered intestinal motility and secretion
  description: >-
    Colonic mucosal inflammation caused by D. fragilis leads to altered
    intestinal motility and increased secretory activity. This manifests
    clinically as diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and nausea. The
    mechanisms likely involve local release of inflammatory mediators that
    affect smooth muscle contractility and epithelial ion transport.

    Paromomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with luminal antiprotozoal activity.
    It has shown high eradication rates for D. fragilis and is recommended as
    first-line therapy in several clinical guidelines due to its narrow spectrum
    of activity and minimal systemic absorption.

    IBS presents with chronic or recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and altered
    bowel habits, closely overlapping with dientamoebiasis symptoms. D. fragilis
    is known to cause IBS-like symptoms and may be misdiagnosed as IBS when
    stool parasitology is not performed. A meta-analysis found no significant

- name: Giardiasis
  description: >-
    Giardia intestinalis infection presents with diarrhea, abdominal cramps,
    bloating, and flatulence, symptoms largely indistinguishable from
