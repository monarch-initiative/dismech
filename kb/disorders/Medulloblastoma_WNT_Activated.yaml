name: Medulloblastoma, WNT-Activated
description: >-
  Medulloblastoma, WNT-activated, is a molecularly defined subgroup of medulloblastoma
  characterized by activation of the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway, typically
  through somatic CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) exon 3 mutations or germline APC mutations.
  This subgroup represents approximately 10% of medulloblastomas and has the most
  favorable prognosis of all molecular subgroups, with >95% long-term survival.
  WNT-activated tumors arise from lower rhombic lip progenitors, have classic
  histology, and are characterized by nuclear beta-catenin accumulation, monosomy 6,
  and expression of WNT target genes including DKK1 and AXIN2. Treatment de-escalation
  trials are exploring reduced-intensity therapy to minimize long-term toxicity.

has_subtypes:
- name: WNT-Activated Medulloblastoma with CTNNB1 Mutation
  description: >-
    The most common form, with somatic activating mutations in CTNNB1 exon 3
    that prevent beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. Sporadic, not
    associated with germline predisposition.
- name: WNT-Activated Medulloblastoma with APC Mutation
  description: >-
    Associated with Turcot syndrome (APC germline mutation). APC normally
    promotes beta-catenin degradation; loss leads to WNT pathway activation.
    Patients require genetic counseling and screening for colorectal polyposis.
pathophysiology:
- name: WNT/Beta-Catenin Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    Activating mutations in CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) prevent phosphorylation at
    serine/threonine residues in exon 3, blocking proteasomal degradation. This
    leads to nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, which complexes with TCF/LEF
    transcription factors to activate WNT target genes.

genetic:
- name: CTNNB1
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations are present in approximately 85-90% of WNT-activated
    medulloblastomas. Mutations occur at serine/threonine phosphorylation sites
    (codons 33, 37, 41, 45), preventing APC/Axin-mediated degradation.
- name: APC
  association: Germline/Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    APC mutations occur in approximately 10-15% of WNT-activated medulloblastomas.
    Germline APC mutations cause Turcot syndrome (familial adenomatous polyposis
    with CNS tumors). Somatic APC mutations also occur.
- name: DDX3X
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    DDX3X mutations occur in approximately 50% of WNT-activated medulloblastomas.
    DDX3X encodes an RNA helicase that may cooperate with WNT signaling in
    tumorigenesis.
- name: SMARCA4
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    SMARCA4 mutations occur in approximately 25% of WNT-activated medulloblastomas.

- name: TP53
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations are rare in WNT-activated medulloblastoma (approximately 5%),
    in contrast to SHH-activated tumors where they confer worse prognosis.
- name: Monosomy 6
  association: Chromosomal Alteration
  notes: >-
    Monosomy 6 is present in approximately 85% of WNT-activated medulloblastomas
    and is a useful cytogenetic marker for this subgroup. The mechanism by which
    it contributes to tumorigenesis is unclear.

    Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is standard for medulloblastoma due to risk
    of leptomeningeal dissemination. Treatment de-escalation trials are exploring
    reduced-dose CSI (18-23.4 Gy vs standard 23.4-36 Gy) for WNT-activated tumors
    given excellent prognosis.

  WNT-activated medulloblastoma has the best prognosis of all molecular subgroups
  with >95% 5-year survival. This excellent outcome has led to treatment
  de-escalation trials (e.g., SJMB12, ACNS1422) exploring reduced radiation and
  chemotherapy to minimize late effects including neurocognitive dysfunction,
  endocrine deficiencies, hearing loss, and secondary malignancies while
  maintaining cure rates.
