description: >-
  Taurodontism is a developmental dental anomaly of multirooted teeth defined by
  enlarged pulp chambers, apical displacement of the pulpal floor, and reduced
  cervical constriction. It is observed as an isolated trait and in syndromic
  contexts, with documented genetic associations involving WNT10A-, DLX3-, and
  KCTD1-related disorders and emerging mechanistic evidence for Axin1-AKT1-mTORC1-Shh dysregulation in Hertwig epithelial root sheath.

    but is differentiated by hair and osseous manifestations.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Non-dental findings in TDO include hair phenotype changes and osseous abnormalities.
  - Taurodontism may overlap, but systemic ectodermal/skeletal findings support TDO over isolated taurodontism.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:10466415
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "While enamel hypoplasia and taurodontism appear to be present in all TDO cases, non-dental features may be absent, with approximately half of TDO cases losing the kinky/curly hair phenotype seen in infancy by adolescence, and in almost 20% of cases, osseous changes are not evident."
    explanation: Supports overlap in taurodontism but identifies distinguishing syndromic features for TDO.

      id: MONDO:0006823
      label: Klinefelter syndrome
  description: >-
    Taurodontism may occur as part of chromosomal syndrome presentations such as
    XXY Klinefelter syndrome rather than as an isolated dental anomaly.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Chromosomal and endocrine phenotype (XXY syndrome) distinguishes Klinefelter syndrome from isolated taurodontism.
  - Taurodontism is a frequent associated anomaly in Klinefelter syndrome rather than the sole defining diagnosis.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:745217
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "Taurodont molars were observed in 6 of the 31 cases (19.4%), a significantly higher rate than among the controls."
    explanation: Supports Klinefelter syndrome as a syndromic context where taurodontism can present and require differential consideration.
