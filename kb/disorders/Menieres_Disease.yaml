pathophysiology:
  - name: Endolymphatic Hydrops
    description: >
      Meniere's disease is characterized by distension of the endolymphatic space
      (endolymphatic hydrops) due to impaired reabsorption of endolymph or excess
      production. This results in rupture of the membranous labyrinth and mixing
      of endolymph and perilymph, leading to vestibular and cochlear dysfunction.

        snippet: "Over 75 years ago, endolymphatic hydrops was discovered as the pathologic correlate of Menière's disease."
        explanation: "This review confirms endolymphatic hydrops as the pathologic correlate of Meniere's disease."
  - name: Ion Transport Dysfunction
    description: >
      Abnormal regulation of fluid and ion homeostasis in the inner ear, particularly
      involving potassium transport in the stria vascularis and endolymphatic sac,
      contributes to endolymph accumulation and hydrops formation.

  - name: Autoimmune and Inflammatory Mechanisms
    description: >
      Elevated inflammatory markers and autoantibodies have been found in some patients,
      suggesting that immune-mediated inner ear damage may contribute to disease
      pathogenesis in a subset of cases.

phenotypes:
  - name: Episodic Vertigo
    description: >
      Recurrent attacks of spinning vertigo lasting 20 minutes to several hours,
      often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Episodes are unpredictable and
      can be severely debilitating.

  - name: Sensorineural Hearing Loss
    description: >
      Fluctuating, progressive hearing loss initially affecting low frequencies,
      eventually becoming permanent and affecting all frequencies as the disease
      progresses.

  - name: Tinnitus
    description: >
      Ringing, buzzing, or roaring sounds in the affected ear, often low-pitched
      and fluctuating. May become constant with disease progression.
