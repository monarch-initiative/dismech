  - name: Endolymphatic Hydrops
    description: >
      Meniere's disease is characterized by distension of the endolymphatic space
      (endolymphatic hydrops) due to impaired reabsorption of endolymph or excess
      production. This results in rupture of the membranous labyrinth and mixing
      of endolymph and perilymph, leading to vestibular and cochlear dysfunction.

        explanation: "This review confirms endolymphatic hydrops as the pathologic correlate of Meniere's disease."
  - name: Ion Transport Dysfunction
    description: >
      Abnormal regulation of fluid and ion homeostasis in the inner ear, particularly involving
      potassium transport in the stria vascularis and endolymphatic sac, contributes to endolymph
      accumulation and hydrops formation. Dysregulation of Na+/K+-ATPase, NKCC1, and K+ channels
      disrupts the electrochemical gradients required for normal endolymphatic fluid balance.

  - name: Autoimmune and Inflammatory Mechanisms
    description: >
      Elevated inflammatory markers and autoantibodies have been found in some patients,
      suggesting that immune-mediated inner ear damage may contribute to disease
      pathogenesis in a subset of cases. Local (inner ear/endolymphatic sac) and systemic immune
      activation includes cytokine signaling and NF-κB pathway engagement. TWEAK-FN14 receptor
      signaling and dysregulated Fcγ receptor polymorphisms contribute to immune complex-mediated injury.

  - name: Blood-Labyrinth Barrier Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress
    description: >
      The blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB) maintains inner-ear homeostasis through tight junctions between
      endothelial cells and pericytes. In MD, increased vascular permeability and oxidative/nitrosative
      stress damage the BLB, leading to edema and epithelial dysfunction. Elevated iNOS and nitrotyrosine
      levels indicate oxidative stress-mediated cascading cellular injury.
