  PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer is a molecularly-defined subset of breast cancer
  characterized by activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene, which encodes the
  p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PIK3CA
  mutations occur in approximately 40% of ER-positive breast cancers and 10-20%
  of other subtypes, making it one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in
  breast cancer. Hotspot mutations (E545K, H1047R) constitutively activate the
  PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. FDA approval of the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib
  established PIK3CA mutation as a predictive biomarker for targeted therapy.

- name: PIK3CA Oncogenic Mutations
  description: >-
    Activating PIK3CA mutations occur as somatic events in breast cancer cells.
    Hotspot mutations cluster in the helical domain (E542K, E545K) and kinase
    domain (H1047R). These mutations cause constitutive PI3K activity independent
    of upstream receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.

  description: >-
    Mutant PI3K generates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3),
    recruiting and activating AKT (protein kinase B). Activated AKT phosphorylates
    numerous substrates promoting cell survival, proliferation, metabolism,
    and resistance to apoptosis.

  description: >-
    AKT activates mTORC1 by inhibiting the TSC1/TSC2 complex, relieving suppression
    of the small GTPase Rheb. Active mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis, cell
    growth, and metabolic reprogramming through S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.

- name: Cell Survival and Proliferation
  description: >-
    PI3K-AKT signaling promotes cell survival through phosphorylation and
    inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins (BAD, FOXO transcription factors)
    and cell proliferation through multiple mechanisms including cyclin D1
    stabilization.

- name: Endocrine Resistance
  description: >-
    In ER+ breast cancer, PIK3CA mutations confer partial resistance to endocrine
    therapy through crosstalk between PI3K and ER signaling. PI3K pathway
    activation can maintain tumor growth despite estrogen deprivation.

    Defining feature is presence of activating PIK3CA mutation. Three hotspots
    (E542K, E545K, H1047R) account for approximately 80% of mutations. Testing
    by NGS or PCR-based assays is required for treatment selection.

    PIK3CA mutation testing is required for alpelisib eligibility. Can be
    performed on tumor tissue or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). FDA-approved
    companion diagnostics include therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit and
    FoundationOne CDx.

  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    PIK3CA (3q26.32) encodes p110α, the catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K.
    Activating mutations occur somatically. Hotspot mutations: E542K and E545K
    in exon 9 (helical domain) disrupt inhibitory interaction with p85 regulatory
    subunit; H1047R in exon 20 (kinase domain) enhances membrane binding and
    catalytic activity. Both mechanisms result in constitutive kinase activity.
