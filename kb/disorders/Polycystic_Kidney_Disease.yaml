  description: Caused by mutations in PKD1 gene on chromosome 16p13.3. Accounts for approximately 85% of cases with more severe disease progression.
- name: ADPKD Type 2
  description: Caused by mutations in PKD2 gene on chromosome 4q22. Accounts for approximately 15% of cases with milder disease progression and later onset of ESRD.
inheritance:
- name: Autosomal Dominant
  description: ADPKD follows autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance but variable expressivity.
pathophysiology:
- name: Ciliary Dysfunction
  description: >
    Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 proteins localize to primary cilia and form a receptor-ion channel
    complex essential for mechanosensation and calcium signaling. Mutations disrupt ciliary function,
    leading to abnormal cell proliferation and fluid secretion.

    Loss of polycystin function leads to increased cellular proliferation and chloride-driven

    progressively enlarge over time, compressing normal renal parenchyma.

review_notes: >
  ADPKD is the most common hereditary kidney disease, affecting approximately 1 in 400-1000 individuals
  worldwide. It is characterized by progressive bilateral renal cyst development leading to kidney
  enlargement and eventual renal failure. The disease is caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 genes,
  which encode polycystin proteins that localize to primary cilia. Tolvaptan is the first approved
  disease-modifying therapy. Note that the user-provided MONDO ID (0004567) was incorrect - that
  refers to ileus. The correct MONDO ID for ADPKD is MONDO:0004691.
