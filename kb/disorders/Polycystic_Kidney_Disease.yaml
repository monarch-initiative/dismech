description: >
  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the
  development of multiple fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. The autosomal dominant
  form (ADPKD) is one of the most common inherited kidney diseases, affecting
  approximately 1 in 500-1000 people. ADPKD is caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2
  genes and typically presents in adulthood with progressive renal enlargement,
  hypertension, and eventual kidney failure. Autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD) is
  less common and typically presents in infancy or childhood.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Vasopressin/cAMP-Driven Cyst Expansion
    description: >
      Elevated vasopressin signaling via V2 receptors increases cAMP in tubular
      epithelial cells, driving chloride and fluid secretion into cysts and promoting
      cyst wall growth. Blocking V2 signaling slows total kidney volume expansion.
