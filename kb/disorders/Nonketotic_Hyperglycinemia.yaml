description: 'Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), also known as glycine encephalopathy, is a rare autosomal recessive inborn
  error of glycine metabolism caused by deficient activity of the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system (GCS). The GCS normally
  catabolizes glycine via decarboxylation and transfers a one-carbon unit to tetrahydrofolate to form 5,10-methylene-THF,
  supporting serine-glycine-one-carbon (SGOC) metabolism. Mutations in GLDC, AMT, or less commonly GCSH disrupt this pathway,
  producing systemic and CNS glycine accumulation and downstream one-carbon deficits. The disease is characterized biochemically
  by elevated glycine in blood and cerebrospinal fluid with an increased CSF-to-plasma glycine ratio. Clinical presentation
  ranges from severe neonatal encephalopathy with intractable seizures, apnea, and profound hypotonia to attenuated forms
  with variable developmental delay and behavioral phenotypes. Worldwide incidence is estimated at approximately 1 in 76,000,
  with higher prevalence in certain populations such as northern Finland (1 in 12,000).

    decreased in NKH, which may result in underactivation of these receptors. A 2024 expert reassessment highlights that direct
    experimental evidence for net NMDA over- versus under-activation has not been established, and glycine also acts on inhibitory
    strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in brainstem and spinal cord, contributing to respiratory and motor phenotypes.

    snippet: Average plasma glycine levels were significantly lower with KD compared to benzoate monotherapy by on average
      28%.
    explanation: Demonstrates KD effectiveness for glycine reduction.

    snippet: KD is an effective glycine reduction method in NKH, and may provide a more consistent reduction in plasma glycine
      levels than high-dose benzoate therapy.
    explanation: Supports KD as an effective glycine reduction strategy.
- name: NMDA antagonist therapy (dextromethorphan/ketamine)
  description: 'NMDA receptor antagonists such as dextromethorphan and ketamine have been used to counteract presumed NMDA
    receptor overactivation by excess glycine. However, a 2024 expert reassessment finds insufficient evidence of added therapeutic
    benefit beyond glycine reduction strategies, and notes potential adverse behavioral effects. Controlled clinical studies
    have never been performed.

    snippet: Clear clinical evidence of an added therapeutic benefit beyond the use of glycine reduction strategies from use
      of either dextromethorphan or ketamine in nonketotic hyperglycinemia has not been documented.
    explanation: Expert reassessment finds no clear evidence of therapeutic benefit.
  - reference: PMID:39423724

    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: The systematic use of these NMDA-type receptor antagonists in nonketotic hyperglycinemia should be reevaluated,
      particularly in light of emerging potential adverse effects.
    explanation: Recommends reevaluation of NMDA antagonist use due to potential adverse effects.

    snippet: Maladaptive behaviors were significantly related to female sex and to taking dextromethorphan, but no significant
      relation between plasma glycine levels and behavior was found.
    explanation: Dextromethorphan use associated with maladaptive behaviors in attenuated NKH.
- name: Anticonvulsant therapy
  description: 'Antiepileptic drugs are used for seizure management in NKH. Sodium valproate is specifically contraindicated
    because it increases both CSF and plasma glycine levels, potentially worsening seizures. Appropriate anticonvulsant selection
    is critical in NKH management.

    snippet: Patients showed up for admission with a history of seizures (15/20)
    explanation: High seizure frequency (75%) supports the need for anticonvulsant therapy, though the snippet does not specify which anticonvulsants are used.
  notes: Sodium valproate is contraindicated as it increases glycine levels and worsens seizures.
- name: Supportive care
  description: 'Comprehensive supportive care including ventilatory support for apnea, feeding support, developmental therapies,
    and monitoring for metabolic decompensation. NKH neonates frequently require intensive care. Long-term care includes management
    of neurodevelopmental disability.

- name: Genetic counseling
  description: 'Genetic counseling is indicated for families with NKH given the autosomal recessive inheritance, 25% recurrence
    risk, and the availability of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal diagnosis is possible when familial variants are known.

      spectrum of GLDC and provide crucial guidance for both the patient's clinical management and family's reproductive genetic
      counseling.
    explanation: Demonstrates the value of molecular diagnosis for genetic counseling in NKH families.
diagnosis:
- name: Newborn screening
  description: 'NKH diagnosis should be considered for neonates presenting with seizures, hypotonia, lethargy, and apnea.
    Biochemical screening using plasma and CSF glycine levels with CSF-to-plasma ratio calculation is the standard diagnostic
    approach. Early diagnosis enables timely intervention.

    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: NKH diagnosis should be considered for neonates presenting specific symptoms. The present survey provides clinical
      data that support the development of a standardized protocol for diagnosing and treating NKH in China.
    explanation: Supports the importance of early NKH detection and standardized diagnostic protocols.
notes: 'NKH pathophysiology is increasingly recognized as multifactorial, extending beyond simple glycine neurotoxicity to
  encompass serine-glycine-one-carbon metabolic disruption, altered glial differentiation, oxidative stress from reduced glutathione,
  and in variant NKH (GCSH mutations) bioenergetic failure from impaired lipoylation. MRI and EEG abnormalities may be more
  reliable prognostic indicators than biochemical glycine levels. The benefit of NMDA receptor antagonist therapy is under
  critical reassessment. Recent iPSC-based disease modeling has opened new avenues for understanding and potentially treating
  the metabolic and neurodevelopmental dimensions of NKH beyond glycine reduction alone.
