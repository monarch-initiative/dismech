name: Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
description: >-
  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
  representing 30-40% of cases. It is characterized by diffuse proliferation of large
  B-lymphoid cells and is clinically aggressive but potentially curable with
  immunochemotherapy. Gene expression profiling identifies two major molecular subtypes:
  germinal center B-cell (GCB) type with better prognosis and activated B-cell (ABC)
  type with inferior outcomes. MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements define high-grade
  "double-hit" or "triple-hit" lymphomas with aggressive behavior. R-CHOP
  (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) remains standard
  frontline therapy, with novel approaches for relapsed disease.

has_subtypes:
- name: Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) Type
  description: >-
    DLBCL with gene expression profile resembling normal germinal center B cells.
    Characterized by expression of GCB markers (CD10, BCL6, GCET1). Often harbors
    BCL2 translocation and EZH2 mutations. Better prognosis than ABC type with
    R-CHOP, with approximately 60-70% cure rates.
- name: Activated B-cell (ABC) Type
  description: >-
    DLBCL with gene expression profile resembling activated peripheral B cells.
    Shows constitutive NF-kB activation, often through mutations in CD79A/B, CARD11,
    MYD88, or deletions of A20. Inferior prognosis with standard R-CHOP. May benefit
    from targeted agents inhibiting NF-kB pathway.
- name: High-Grade B-cell Lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 Rearrangements
  description: >-
    Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) with concurrent MYC and BCL2 translocations, or
    triple-hit with MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements. Highly aggressive with
    poor outcomes to standard R-CHOP. Requires intensified therapy.
pathophysiology:
- name: Germinal Center B-cell Origin
  description: >-
    DLBCL arises from germinal center or post-germinal center B cells undergoing
    somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination. These processes introduce
    DNA double-strand breaks that can lead to oncogenic translocations. The cell
    of origin determines molecular subtype and clinical behavior.

  description: >-
    BCL2 translocation t(14;18) occurs in approximately 30% of GCB-DLBCL, placing
    BCL2 under immunoglobulin enhancer control. Resulting BCL2 overexpression
    blocks the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, allowing survival of cells that
    would normally die in the germinal center.

  description: >-
    MYC rearrangements occur in 10-15% of DLBCL, most commonly with IGH but also
    with non-immunoglobulin partners. MYC overexpression drives cellular proliferation
    and metabolism. When combined with BCL2 rearrangement (double-hit lymphoma),
    creates highly aggressive disease.

    ABC-DLBCL shows constitutive NF-kB activation through various mechanisms

    mutation, or A20 deletion. NF-kB promotes survival and contributes to the
    aggressive behavior of ABC subtype.

- name: Tissue Biopsy and Immunohistochemistry
  notes: >-
    Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy showing diffuse large B cells. IHC panel
    includes CD20, CD3, CD10, BCL6, MUM1/IRF4, BCL2, MYC, and Ki-67.
    Hans algorithm (CD10, BCL6, MUM1) classifies GCB vs non-GCB subtypes.
- name: FISH for Translocations
  notes: >-
    FISH testing for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements is essential to
    identify high-grade double-hit or triple-hit lymphomas, which require
    intensified treatment approaches.
genetic:
- name: BCL2 Translocation
  association: GCB Subtype Marker
  notes: >-
    The t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation occurs in 30% of GCB-DLBCL, placing
    BCL2 under IGH enhancer control. When combined with MYC rearrangement,
    defines double-hit lymphoma with aggressive behavior.
- name: MYC Rearrangement
  association: Adverse Prognostic Marker
  notes: >-
    MYC translocations occur in 10-15% of DLBCL. MYC rearrangement with
    BCL2 and/or BCL6 defines high-grade B-cell lymphoma (double/triple hit)
    with poor prognosis requiring intensified therapy.
- name: MYD88 L265P Mutation
  association: ABC Subtype Marker
  notes: >-
    MYD88 L265P is present in 30% of ABC-DLBCL and drives NF-kB activation
    through TLR signaling. Associated with extranodal disease, particularly
    CNS and testicular involvement.
- name: BCL6 Rearrangement
  association: Lymphoma Driver
  notes: >-
    BCL6 translocations occur in 30% of DLBCL and may contribute to
    oncogenesis. BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor essential for germinal
    center function.
