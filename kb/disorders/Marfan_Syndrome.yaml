description: Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in FBN1, which encodes fibrillin-1. It affects multiple organ systems including the cardiovascular system (aortic root dilation and dissection), skeleton (tall stature, arachnodactyly, scoliosis), and eyes (ectopia lentis).
