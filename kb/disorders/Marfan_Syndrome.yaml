  - reference: PMID:9789865
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: The person with Marfan syndrome is often tall and agile and may unknowingly
      participate in certain physical activities and sports, putting himself or herself
      at risk for aortic dissection and sudden death.
    explanation: The article suggests that physical activity restrictions are necessary
      to prevent aortic dissection in individuals with Marfan syndrome.

    snippet: We instructed patients to take 10 000 steps per day, tracked by an activity
      tracker... AoR Z score in the intervention group had a significantly lower rate
      of change per year compared with the controls (rate of change, -0.24 versus
      +0.008; P=0.01).
    explanation: The study indicates that controlled physical activity can reduce
      the rate of aortic root dilation, which is associated with a lower risk of aortic
      dissection.

    snippet: Over the 5-month experimental period, aortic root dilation rate was significantly
      greater in the sedentary MF group, compared with the wild-type group (∆mm, 0.27±0.07
      versus 0.13±0.02, respectively). Exercise significantly blunted the aortic root
      dilation rate in MF mice compared with sedentary MF littermates (∆mm, 0.10±0.04
      versus 0.27±0.07, respectively).
    explanation: Moderate dynamic exercise mitigates the progression of cardiovascular
      issues in Marfan syndrome, indirectly supporting the idea that physical activity
      restrictions can help manage aortic dissection risk.

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Beta-blockers remain the mainstay of therapy as they have proven to slow
      aortic enlargement. Angiotensin receptor blockers are a useful alternative and
      with proven benefit as an add-on therapy to limit aortic growth.
    explanation: Beta-blockers are used to slow aortic enlargement, which indirectly
      reduces stress on the aorta. However, they do not prevent aortic enlargement
      entirely.

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Traditional medical therapies, such as beta-adrenergic receptor blockade,
      are used to slow pathologic aortic growth and decrease the risk of aortic dissection
      by decreasing hemodynamic stress.
    explanation: Beta-blockers are used to slow aortic growth and decrease hemodynamic
      stress, but they do not completely prevent aortic enlargement.
  - reference: PMID:17376944
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Medical treatment with beta-blockers is probably helpful in most children
      with aortic root dilatation.
    explanation: Beta-blockers are helpful in slowing the progression of aortic root
      dilatation, but they do not completely prevent it.

    snippet: To prevent such catastrophic aortic events, a lower threshold has been
      recommended for prophylactic interventions on the aortic root.
    explanation: The literature mentions that prophylactic aortic root replacement
      is recommended to prevent severe aortic events such as dissections.

    explanation: The study investigates predictors for referral for aortic surgery
      in patients with Marfan syndrome, indicating that surgery is recommended for
      severe aortic dilation.
