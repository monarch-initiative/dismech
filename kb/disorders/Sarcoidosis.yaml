description: >
  Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized
  by the formation of non-caseating granulomas, most commonly affecting the lungs
  and lymph nodes. It predominantly affects adults aged 20-40 years, with higher
  incidence in African Americans and Northern Europeans. Clinical presentation
  ranges from asymptomatic to severe organ dysfunction. While many cases resolve
  spontaneously, chronic progressive disease occurs in a significant subset.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Granuloma Formation
    description: >
      Non-caseating granulomas consist of organized collections of activated
      macrophages (epithelioid cells), multinucleated giant cells, and CD4+ T cells.
      Th1/Th17 immune responses drive granuloma development in response to
      unidentified antigens.

    description: >
      Exaggerated CD4+ T helper cell response with Th1 polarization leads to
      interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha production. Regulatory T cell dysfunction
      contributes to persistent inflammation. Paradoxical peripheral anergy
      coexists with organ-specific hyperactivity.

    description: >
      Chronic granulomatous inflammation can progress to fibrosis, particularly
      in the lungs. Fibroblast activation and excessive collagen deposition
      lead to irreversible organ damage and functional impairment.
