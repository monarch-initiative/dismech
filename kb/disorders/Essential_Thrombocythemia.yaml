name: Essential Thrombocythemia
description: >-
  Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized
  by sustained megakaryocyte proliferation leading to elevated platelet counts.
  Driver mutations include JAK2 V617F (approximately 55%), CALR (25%), and MPL (3%),
  with 15% being triple-negative. ET has the most indolent course among classic
  myeloproliferative neoplasms with near-normal life expectancy in younger patients,
  though it carries risks of thrombosis, hemorrhage, and transformation to myelofibrosis
  or acute leukemia. Treatment focuses on thrombosis prevention with aspirin and
  cytoreduction in high-risk patients using hydroxyurea, anagrelide, or interferon.

pathophysiology:
- name: JAK-STAT Pathway Hyperactivation
  description: >-
    Driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL converge on constitutive JAK-STAT
    signaling activation. JAK2 V617F directly activates the kinase; CALR mutations
    cause aberrant activation of MPL receptor; MPL mutations cause constitutive
    thrombopoietin receptor activation.

    snippet: "Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), often associated with mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL."
    explanation: This abstract links ET to JAK2/CALR/MPL mutations, supporting the JAK-STAT activation described.

- name: Enhanced Megakaryopoiesis
  description: >-
    Constitutive JAK-STAT signaling drives increased megakaryocyte proliferation
    and maturation. Unlike myelofibrosis, megakaryocytes in ET are large and
    mature without significant atypia or clustering.

- name: Platelet Dysfunction and Thrombosis Risk
  description: >-
    Despite elevated platelet counts, thrombosis risk is multifactorial and
    involves platelet activation, leukocyte-platelet interactions, and
    endothelial dysfunction. Paradoxically, extreme thrombocytosis (>1,000,000/uL)
    may cause acquired von Willebrand disease and bleeding.

biochemical:
- name: Complete Blood Count
  notes: >-
    Platelet count is elevated (>450,000/uL). Hemoglobin and WBC are typically
    normal, helping distinguish ET from other myeloproliferative neoplasms.
- name: Bone Marrow Biopsy
  notes: >-
    Shows increased megakaryocytes that are large and mature with hyperlobated
    nuclei without significant atypia or fibrosis. Helps exclude prefibrotic
    myelofibrosis.
genetic:
- name: JAK2
  association: Somatic Activating Mutations
  notes: >-
    JAK2 V617F occurs in approximately 55% of ET patients. Associated with
    older age, higher hemoglobin, and increased thrombosis risk compared to
    CALR-mutated ET.
- name: CALR
  association: Somatic Frameshift Mutations
  notes: >-
    CALR exon 9 frameshift mutations occur in approximately 25% of ET. Type 1
    mutations more common. Associated with younger age, higher platelet count,
    and lower thrombosis risk than JAK2 mutations.
- name: MPL
  association: Somatic Activating Mutations
  notes: >-
    MPL W515L/K mutations occur in approximately 3% of ET. Activates JAK-STAT
    signaling through the thrombopoietin receptor.
treatments:

  description: >-
    Recommended for all ET patients without contraindications. Reduces
    microvascular symptoms (erythromelalgia, headache) and thrombotic events.
