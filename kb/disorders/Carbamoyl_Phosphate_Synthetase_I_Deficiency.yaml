description: 'Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive proximal urea cycle disorder
  caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the CPS1 gene. CPS1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of the urea cycle
  in hepatocyte mitochondria, condensing ammonia and bicarbonate into carbamoyl phosphate. Loss of CPS1 activity causes failure
  of hepatic ammonia detoxification, leading to systemic hyperammonemia, low plasma citrulline, elevated plasma glutamine,
  and characteristically low or absent urinary orotic acid. Ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier and is detoxified to glutamine
  in astrocytes, causing intracellular glutamine accumulation, astrocyte swelling, cerebral edema, seizures, and long-term
  neurocognitive injury. CPS1D presents as a severe neonatal-onset form with acute hyperammonemic crisis or a milder late-onset
  form with residual enzyme activity. The Spanish UCD registry reports CPS1D mortality of 36.8%, the highest among urea cycle
  disorders, with neurological impairment in approximately 58% of cases.

    explanation: Directly supports carglumic acid use and its potential contribution to survival in CPS1D.
- name: Acute crisis management with dialysis
  description: 'During severe hyperammonemic crises, rapid extracorporeal ammonia removal by hemodialysis or continuous hemodiafiltration
    is essential. Noori et al. report hemodialysis lowering ammonia to 27 umol/L within 6 hours. The adult CPS1D case by Yokota
    et al. used continuous hemodiafiltration with rapid clinical improvement.

- name: Liver transplantation
  description: 'Liver transplantation is the definitive metabolic correction for CPS1D, replacing the deficient hepatic CPS1
    enzyme. Vega et al. report 100% survival among transplanted UCD survivors, with normalized protein tolerance, though neurologic
    sequelae persisted in 69% without progression. In the Spanish registry, transplanted UCD patients had 95.2% survival.
    However, transplantation does not reverse pre-existing neurodevelopmental injury.

      of previous studies, which reminds us that it may help to explore the pathogenesis of the disease and contribute to
      genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.
    explanation: Directly supports the role of genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis in CPS1D families.
prevalence:
- notes: CPS1D is one of the rarest urea cycle disorders. The incidence of all UCDs in Spain was approximately 1:36,063 births
    over the past decade. CPS1D represented approximately 4 of 33 patients in one transplant-center cohort. The Spanish UCD
    registry reported the highest mortality (36.8%) among all UCD subtypes for CPS1D.
progression:
- notes: CPS1D is divided into two clinical strata based on residual enzyme activity. Neonatal-onset (severe) disease presents
    within the first days of life as acute hyperammonemic crisis with encephalopathy, seizures, and high mortality. Late-onset
    disease presents at any age from infancy to adulthood, often triggered by catabolic stress (infection, dehydration, corticosteroids,
    surgery). Triggers increase endogenous protein catabolism and overwhelm residual urea cycle capacity. Long-term neurodevelopmental
    outcome is determined by peak ammonia levels, duration of hyperammonemia, and frequency of recurrent crises. Liver transplantation
    provides definitive metabolic correction but does not reverse established neurological injury.
notes: 'CPS1D is clinically indistinguishable from NAGS deficiency without genetic or enzymatic testing, as both are proximal
  urea cycle defects with identical biochemical profiles (hyperammonemia, low citrulline, high glutamine, low urinary orotic
  acid). NAGS deficiency may respond to carglumic acid therapy more completely since the underlying CPS1 enzyme is intact.
  Distinguishing CPS1D from OTC deficiency relies on urinary orotic acid levels, which are elevated in OTC deficiency but
  low or absent in CPS1D.
