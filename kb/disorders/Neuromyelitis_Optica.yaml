pathophysiology:

  description: >-
    Autoantibodies against AQP4 bind astrocytic end-feet and trigger
    complement-dependent astrocyte damage, driving neuroinflammation.
  cell_types:
  - preferred_term: astrocyte
    term:
      id: CL:0000127
      label: astrocyte

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In NMOSD, the autoantibody (NMO-IgG) binds to the extracellular loops
      of AQP4 as expressed in perivascular astrocytic end-feet and disrupts astrocytes
      in a complement-dependent manner."

      astrocyte disruption.

    NMO-IgG can induce complement-independent astrocyte injury, with antibody-
    induced endocytosis of AQP4 implicated in this mechanism.
