    snippet: "The core clinical characteristics required for patients with NMOSD with AQP4-IgG include clinical syndromes or MRI findings related to optic nerve, spinal cord, area postrema, other brainstem, diencephalic, or cerebral presentations. More stringent clinical criteria, with additional neuroimaging findings, are required for diagnosis of NMOSD without AQP4-IgG or when serologic testing is unavailable."
    explanation: The abstract summarizes stratified criteria and core clinical characteristics.

pathophysiology:
- name: AQP4-IgG-Mediated Astrocyte Injury
  description: >-
    Autoantibodies against AQP4 bind astrocytic end-feet and trigger
    complement-dependent astrocyte damage, driving neuroinflammation.

  - preferred_term: astrocyte

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In NMOSD, the autoantibody (NMO-IgG) binds to the extracellular loops of AQP4 as expressed in perivascular astrocytic end-feet and disrupts astrocytes in a complement-dependent manner."
    explanation: The abstract describes AQP4-IgG binding and complement-mediated astrocyte disruption.
- name: AQP4 Endocytosis and Complement-Independent Cytotoxicity
  description: >-
    NMO-IgG can induce complement-independent astrocyte injury, with antibody-
    induced endocytosis of AQP4 implicated in this mechanism.
