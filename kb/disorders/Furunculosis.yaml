  Furunculosis is a recurrent deep follicular infection with localized abscess
  (boil) formation, usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The condition is
  closely linked to persistent colonization reservoirs and virulence factors,
  including Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), that promote recurrence and
  severe suppurative disease.

    snippet: "The detection of 16S rRNA, mecA and luk-PV genes was performed by PCR and the risk factors were assessed with the statistical analysis of a questionnaire."
    explanation: Demonstrates PCR-based molecular characterization relevant to recurrence and virulence risk.

- name: Folliculitis
  disease_term:
    preferred_term: folliculitis
    term:
      id: MONDO:0006552
      label: folliculitis
  description: Superficial follicular inflammation that can precede but is usually less deep than furunculosis.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Furunculosis involves deeper suppurative abscess formation and recurrent boils.

    snippet: "The most frequent <i>S. aureus</i> infections include impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles, furunculosis, abscesses, hidradenitis suppurativa, and mastitis."
    explanation: Supports folliculitis as a clinically overlapping S. aureus-related condition in the differential.
- name: Hidradenitis suppurativa
  disease_term:
    preferred_term: hidradenitis suppurativa
    term:
      id: MONDO:0006559
      label: hidradenitis suppurativa
  description: Chronic inflammatory nodules and sinus tracts in intertriginous areas can mimic recurrent boils.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Typical distribution in apocrine-rich intertriginous regions with sinus tract/scarring pattern.

    snippet: "The most frequent <i>S. aureus</i> infections include impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles, furunculosis, abscesses, hidradenitis suppurativa, and mastitis."
    explanation: Supports hidradenitis suppurativa as an overlapping cutaneous condition considered alongside furunculosis.
