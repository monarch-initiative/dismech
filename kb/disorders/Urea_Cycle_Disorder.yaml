description: 'Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are a group of inborn errors of metabolism caused by deficiency of one of the six
  enzymes or two transporters involved in the hepatic urea cycle, the principal pathway for disposal of waste nitrogen. Impaired
  conversion of ammonia to urea leads to recurrent or persistent hyperammonemia, particularly during periods of catabolic
  stress, with risk of acute encephalopathy, cerebral edema, seizures, and long-term neurologic injury. The estimated incidence
  is approximately 1 in 35,000 births. Severity and age of onset depend on residual enzyme or transporter function and are
  related to the respective gene mutations. Classical presentations range from neonatal-onset rapidly progressive encephalopathy
  to late-onset episodic hyperammonemia triggered by illness or protein loading.

- name: Arginase 1 (ARG1) deficiency
  features: 'ARG1 deficiency (argininemia) is distinct from other UCDs, often presenting with progressive spastic diplegia
    rather than typical hyperammonemic crises. ARG1 hydrolyzes arginine to ornithine and urea in the final step of the urea
    cycle. Elevated arginine and guanidino compounds are thought to contribute to the spasticity phenotype.

progression:
- notes: 'Disease progression follows a characteristic pattern: (1) inherited enzyme/transporter deficiency reduces hepatic
    ureagenesis capacity; (2) catabolic triggers (infection, fasting, surgery, protein loading) precipitate ammonia accumulation;
    (3) ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to glutamine in astrocytes, driving osmotic swelling and
    cerebral edema; (4) encephalopathy, seizures, and neurological injury develop if ammonia is not rapidly controlled. Chronic
    complications include progressive intellectual disability, movement disorders, and in some subtypes (ASL deficiency),
    liver disease. Late-onset forms may remain undiagnosed until adulthood, presenting during windows of physiological stress.'

notes: 'UCDs are a heterogeneous group with incidence of approximately 1 in 35,000 births. The 2019 revised European guidelines
  (PMID:30982989) remain the primary reference for diagnosis and management. Key advances include quantitative seizure risk
  modeling showing 2.65-fold increased odds per 100 umol/L ammonia (PMID:39121557), identification of glutathione dysregulation
  in ASL deficiency, and development of gene and mRNA therapy approaches. OTC deficiency is the most common subtype, accounting
  for approximately 50% of cases. Adult-onset presentations during catabolic stress are increasingly recognized. The field
  is moving toward hepatocyte-targeted gene and RNA therapies, though liver transplantation remains the only curative option
  currently available.
