name: EGFR-Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
description: >-
  EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a molecularly-defined lung
  cancer subtype driven by activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) gene. EGFR mutations occur in approximately 10-15% of NSCLC
  in Western populations and 40-50% in East Asian populations. Common mutations
  include exon 19 deletions and L858R point mutation (exon 21), which together
  account for ~85% of EGFR mutations and confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). EGFR-mutant NSCLC represents a paradigm for precision
  oncology in solid tumors, with multiple generations of targeted therapy and
  well-characterized resistance mechanisms.

has_subtypes:
- name: EGFR Exon 19 Deletion NSCLC
  description: >-
    In-frame deletions in exon 19 (most commonly delE746-A750) account for
    approximately 45% of EGFR mutations. Generally associated with better
    response to TKIs and longer progression-free survival than L858R.
- name: EGFR L858R Mutant NSCLC
  description: >-
    Point mutation substituting arginine for leucine at codon 858 in exon 21.
    Accounts for approximately 40% of EGFR mutations. Sensitive to EGFR TKIs
    though potentially less so than exon 19 deletions.
- name: EGFR Exon 20 Insertion NSCLC
  description: >-
    In-frame insertions in exon 20 account for 5-10% of EGFR mutations. Most
    are resistant to first- through third-generation TKIs. Amivantamab and
    mobocertinib approved specifically for this population.
- name: EGFR T790M Resistance NSCLC
  description: >-
    T790M gatekeeper mutation emerges in ~50-60% of patients progressing on
    first/second-generation TKIs. Sensitive to third-generation TKI osimertinib.
pathophysiology:
- name: EGFR Oncogenic Mutations
  description: >-
    Activating EGFR mutations occur in the tyrosine kinase domain and cause
    constitutive receptor activation independent of ligand binding. Mutations
    alter the ATP-binding pocket, favoring the active kinase conformation
    and enhancing sensitivity to ATP-competitive TKIs.

    snippet: A subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have specific mutations in the EGFR gene, which 
      correlate with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib.
    explanation: This abstract links EGFR mutations in NSCLC with sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, supporting the role of 
      activating EGFR mutations.

  description: >-
    Mutant EGFR is constitutively phosphorylated, activating downstream signaling
    cascades including RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (proliferation) and PI3K-AKT-mTOR
    (survival). The tumor becomes dependent on (addicted to) EGFR signaling
    for survival.

    description: Tumor survival becomes dependent on EGFR pathway
- name: Oncogene Addiction
  description: >-
    EGFR-mutant tumors exhibit oncogene addiction, with survival critically
    dependent on continued EGFR signaling. EGFR inhibition leads to rapid
    tumor regression through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
    This creates the therapeutic window for TKI therapy.

- name: TKI Resistance Mechanisms
  description: >-
    Resistance to EGFR TKIs develops through multiple mechanisms: secondary
    EGFR mutations (T790M, C797S), bypass pathway activation (MET amplification,
    HER2 amplification), and histologic transformation (small cell or squamous).
    Understanding resistance guides sequential therapy selection.

- name: EGFR Mutation Testing
  notes: >-
    EGFR mutation testing is required for all advanced non-squamous NSCLC.
    Methods include PCR-based assays, next-generation sequencing, and ctDNA
    (liquid biopsy). Testing should detect common sensitizing mutations
    (exon 19 del, L858R), resistance mutations (T790M), and exon 20 insertions.
genetic:
- name: EGFR
  association: Somatic Activating Mutations
  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    EGFR (7p11.2) encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor. Activating mutations
    occur somatically in the tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-21). Exon 19
    deletions and L858R are classical sensitizing mutations. T790M (exon 20)
    and C797S (exon 20) are acquired resistance mutations. Exon 20 insertions
    are primary resistance mutations.

    snippet: "Exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R mutation were the most common epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations."
