  - name: Sarcoidosis
    description: >
      Sarcoidosis can cause facial swelling and non-caseating granulomatous inflammation but presents as a systemic multiorgan disease
      with pulmonary and lymph node involvement, distinct from the primarily orofacial involvement in MRS. Sarcoidosis typically lacks
      recurrent facial nerve paralysis as a primary manifestation.

      preferred_term: sarcoidosis
      term:
        id: MONDO:0019338
        label: sarcoidosis
    distinguishing_features:
      - Sarcoidosis is systemic with pulmonary and hilar lymphadenopathy involvement; MRS is primarily orofacial
      - Sarcoidosis lacks recurrent facial nerve paralysis as primary feature
      - Sarcoidosis has systemic symptoms and elevated ACE levels

        snippet: "Cheilitis granulomatosa (CG) is a persistent and progressive swelling of the lips that can be non-tender and soft or firm to touch, with noncaseating granulomas that are perilymphatic and may show intralymphatic histiocytosis and lymphatic dilatation."

  - name: Bell's palsy
    description: >
      Bell's palsy presents with acute facial paralysis but lacks the chronic recurrent orofacial edema and granulomatous histopathology
      characteristic of MRS. Bell's palsy typically resolves within weeks whereas MRS has chronic relapsing course with persistent
      granulomatous changes between episodes.

      - Bell's palsy is acute/subacute with resolution within weeks; MRS has chronic relapsing course
      - Bell's palsy lacks orofacial edema and granulomatous inflammation on biopsy
      - MRS presents with the classic triad (edema, facial paralysis, fissured tongue)
