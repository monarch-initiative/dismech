description: >-
  Primary progressive aphasia is a neurodegenerative syndrome in which language
  impairment is the dominant and earliest clinical deficit.
has_subtypes:
- name: Nonfluent/Agrammatic Variant PPA
  description: Nonfluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia phenotype.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:21666264
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Primary progressive aphasia is a clinical syndrome that encompasses three major phenotypes: non-fluent/agrammatic, semantic and logopenic."
    explanation: The abstract lists nonfluent/agrammatic PPA as a major phenotype.
- name: Semantic Variant PPA
  description: Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia phenotype.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:21666264
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Primary progressive aphasia is a clinical syndrome that encompasses three major phenotypes: non-fluent/agrammatic, semantic and logopenic."
    explanation: The abstract lists semantic PPA as a major phenotype.
- name: Logopenic Variant PPA
  description: Logopenic primary progressive aphasia phenotype.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:21666264
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Primary progressive aphasia is a clinical syndrome that encompasses three major phenotypes: non-fluent/agrammatic, semantic and logopenic."
    explanation: The abstract lists logopenic PPA as a major phenotype.
pathophysiology:
- name: Progressive Language Network Degeneration
  description: >-
    Neurodegenerative processes selectively affect language networks, leading to
    progressive loss of language function with initial sparing of other domains.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:19300609
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disease of insidious onset presenting with progressive isolated loss of language function, without significant impairment in other cognitive domains."
    explanation: The abstract describes progressive, isolated language loss as the core neurodegenerative process.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disease of insidious onset presenting with progressive isolated loss of language function, without significant impairment in other cognitive domains."
    explanation: Progressive loss of language function defines the aphasic phenotype.
- name: Atypical Behavior
  category: Neuropsychiatric
  frequency: OCCASIONAL
  phenotype_term:
    preferred_term: Atypical behavior
    term:
      id: HP:0000708
      label: Atypical behavior
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:19300609
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Current diagnostic criteria require the language dysfunction to remain isolated for at least two years, and to remain the salient feature as the disease progresses, usually to involve other domains such as behavior, executive functions, and judgment."
    explanation: The abstract notes progression to behavioral involvement in PPA.
genetic:
- name: MAPT
  association: Causative
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:19300609
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Pathogenic mutations in genes coding for the proteins tau and progranulin have been isolated."
    explanation: The abstract cites pathogenic mutations in the tau gene (MAPT).
- name: GRN
  association: Causative
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:19300609
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Pathogenic mutations in genes coding for the proteins tau and progranulin have been isolated."
    explanation: The abstract cites pathogenic mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN).
treatments:
- name: Speech Therapy and Counseling
  description: >-
    Supportive management with speech therapy, counseling, and education for
    patients and caregivers.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:19300609
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Referral to specialized centers where speech therapy, counseling, and education for both patient and caregiver are available may be helpful."
    explanation: The abstract highlights speech therapy and counseling as helpful supportive interventions.
