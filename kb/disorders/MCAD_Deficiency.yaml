synonyms:

  - ACADM deficiency
description: >
  Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is the most common
  inherited disorder of fatty acid beta-oxidation. It is caused by biallelic
  pathogenic variants in ACADM, which encodes the mitochondrial enzyme
  responsible for the initial step of medium-chain fatty acid oxidation.
  Affected individuals cannot metabolize medium-chain fatty acids (C6-C12)
  during periods of fasting or metabolic stress, leading to hypoketotic
  hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and risk of sudden death. Since inclusion in
  newborn screening programs, early diagnosis and preventive management have
  dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Impaired medium-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation
    description: >
      MCAD catalyzes the first step of mitochondrial beta-oxidation for
      medium-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (C6-C12). Deficiency leads to accumulation
      of medium-chain acylcarnitines and failure to generate acetyl-CoA and
      ketone bodies during fasting.

  - name: Hypoketotic hypoglycemia mechanism
    description: >
      During fasting, the body normally switches to fatty acid oxidation for
      energy. In MCAD deficiency, this pathway is blocked, leading to rapid
      depletion of glucose stores without compensatory ketogenesis. The
      resulting hypoketotic hypoglycemia causes encephalopathy and can be fatal.

  - name: Toxic metabolite accumulation
    description: >
      Accumulation of medium-chain fatty acids and their conjugates (octanoate,
      octanoylcarnitine) may have direct toxic effects on brain and liver tissue.
      Accumulated acyl-CoA intermediates deplete free coenzyme A and may cause
      mitochondrial dysfunction.
