description: '3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria (HMGCLD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by
  biallelic pathogenic variants in HMGCL, encoding mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase. This enzyme catalyzes
  the final step of both ketogenesis and leucine degradation, cleaving HMG-CoA to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. Deficiency
  results in failure to produce ketone bodies during catabolic stress and accumulation of leucine-derived toxic organic acids.
  Acute metabolic crises feature hypoketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperammonemia, with neurological sequelae
  including seizures, developmental delay, and white matter abnormalities. More than 95% of reported patients experience at
  least one metabolic decompensation episode, with approximately 42% having neonatal onset. Mortality is reported at approximately
  16%, while over 60% of survivors achieve normal development with appropriate management.

    snippet: The metabolic crisis develops when the infant is first introduced to dietary protein soon after birth, or later,
      when a reduced intake of glucose, often during a viral infection, results in a drain on the infant's circulating glucose
      levels.
    explanation: Identifies fasting and reduced glucose intake as key crisis triggers.

  description: 'Exogenous ketone supplementation (sodium D,L-3-hydroxybutyrate, up to 900 mg/kg/day) bypasses impaired endogenous
    ketogenesis to provide alternative energy substrates for brain and heart. Used in both acute management and chronic adjunct
    therapy. Reported as well tolerated and effective in clinical case series.

notes: 'The 2024 discovery of non-enzymatic mitochondrial protein acylation (3MGCylation) by reactive trans-3-methylglutaconyl-CoA
  intermediates (PMID:39195517) represents an active research frontier that may help explain tissue-specific injury patterns.
  If validated in human tissues, this mechanism could open new therapeutic directions targeting reactive metabolite chemistry.
  The Devanapalli et al. 2023 case report on sodium D,L-3-hydroxybutyrate therapy (doi:10.20517/jtgg.2023.12) provides additional
  clinical detail on exogenous ketone use but lacks a PubMed-indexed PMID.
