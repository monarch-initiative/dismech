description: 'D-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA) is a rare neurometabolic disorder characterized by supraphysiological
  accumulation of the D-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) in body fluids, and clinically by early-onset neurodevelopmental
  impairment with variable severity. Two genetically distinct subtypes exist: type I (D2HGA1) caused by autosomal recessive
  loss-of-function mutations in D2HGDH encoding mitochondrial D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, and type II (D2HGA2) caused
  by heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in IDH2 encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, which confer neomorphic D-2-HG-producing
  activity. Type II is generally more severe, with higher D-2-HG levels, and is particularly associated with cardiomyopathy.
  Both subtypes share neurological features including developmental delay, epilepsy, and hypotonia.

progression:
- notes: 'D-2-HGA typically presents in the neonatal period or early infancy with neurological symptoms including seizures,
    hypotonia, and developmental delay. The clinical course of D-2-HGA type II is generally more severe than type I, with
    higher D-2-HG levels and a broader spectrum of organ involvement including cardiomyopathy. Type I often presents as a
    milder neurometabolic disorder with variable cognitive outcomes. In both subtypes, neurological deficits tend to be progressive
    or static rather than episodic. Cardiomyopathy in type II may be life-threatening and contributes to reduced life span.
    Targeted IDH2 inhibition with enasidenib has shown promise in reversing some pathology in type II patients.

    '
notes: 'D-2-HGA represents a unique intersection of rare metabolic disease and cancer biology, as the D-2-HG oncometabolite
  produced by somatic IDH mutations in gliomas and leukemias is the same metabolite that accumulates in germline D-2-HGA.
  This has enabled reverse repurposing of oncology drugs (enasidenib, originally for IDH2-mutant AML) for the rare metabolic
  disorder. A major practical challenge remains the standardization of enantioselective D-2-HG assays across clinical laboratories,
  as routine mass spectrometry cannot distinguish D- from L-2-HG without chiral resolution methods.
