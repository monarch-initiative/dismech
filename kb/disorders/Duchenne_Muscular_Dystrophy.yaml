name: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
description: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive neuromuscular
  disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene encoding dystrophin. It is characterized
  by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration, typically presenting in early childhood
  with delayed motor milestones and loss of ambulation by adolescence. The absence of
  functional dystrophin leads to muscle fiber fragility, chronic inflammation, and
  replacement of muscle with fibrotic and adipose tissue. Cardiac and respiratory
  complications are major causes of morbidity and mortality.
