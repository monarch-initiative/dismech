has_subtypes:
- name: Classic Duchenne
  description: Complete absence of dystrophin, onset by age 5, wheelchair-dependent by early teens.

  description: Partial dystrophin expression, intermediate severity between DMD and Becker.
pathophysiology:
- name: Dystrophin Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in the DMD gene cause absent or dysfunctional dystrophin protein.
    Dystrophin links the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in muscle fibers,
    providing structural stability during contraction.

    description: Loss of dystrophin destabilizes the dystrophin-associated complex and increases membrane tear susceptibility.
- name: Sarcolemmal Fragility and Calcium Influx
  description: >

  description: >
    Without dystrophin, muscle fibers are susceptible to contraction-induced damage.

    leading to fibrosis and fatty replacement of muscle tissue.
