    label: Guillain-Barre syndrome
description: >-
  An acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy characterized by rapidly
  progressive symmetric weakness and areflexia. Typically preceded by infection,
  with molecular mimicry between pathogen antigens and peripheral nerve
  gangliosides driving the autoimmune response.
pathophysiology:
- name: Molecular Mimicry and Antiganglioside Antibodies
  description: >-
    Antibodies against bacterial lipooligosaccharides (especially from
    Campylobacter jejuni) cross-react with gangliosides on peripheral nerves.
    Anti-GM1, anti-GD1a, and anti-GQ1b antibodies are associated with
    specific clinical subtypes.

    snippet: >-
      Molecular mimicry between sialylated lipooligosaccharide structures on the cell
      envelope of these bacteria and ganglioside epitopes on the human nerves that
      generates cross-reactive immune response results in autoimmune-driven nerve
      damage.
    explanation: >-
      Demonstrates the molecular mimicry mechanism where C. jejuni lipooligosaccharides
      resemble nerve gangliosides, leading to cross-reactive antibodies that attack
      peripheral nerves.

    snippet: >-
      The presence of specific anti-glycoconjugate antibodies indicates an underlying
      process of molecular mimicry and sometimes assists in the classification of these
      disorders.
    explanation: >-
      Confirms that anti-ganglioside antibodies in GBS result from molecular mimicry
      and help classify disease subtypes.
- name: Complement-Mediated Nerve Damage
  description: >-
    Antibody binding activates complement cascade, leading to membrane attack
    complex deposition on Schwann cells and nodes of Ranvier. This causes
    demyelination in AIDP or axonal damage in AMAN/AMSAN variants.

  evidence:

    snippet: >-
      These data indicate that anti-ganglioside antibodies can diffuse into a
      desheathed nerve, bind to nodes of Ranvier and fix complement in vitro without
      resulting in any overt physiological deterioration of the nerve over 4-6 h.
    explanation: >-
      Demonstrates that anti-ganglioside antibodies bind nodes of Ranvier and activate
      complement cascade, establishing the complement-mediated mechanism of nerve damage.

    snippet: >-
      Many fibers had a rim of the complement activation marker C3d and the terminal
      complement complex neoantigen C5b-9 along the outer surface of the Schwann cells.
    explanation: >-
      Immunocytochemistry evidence showing C3d and C5b-9 membrane attack complex deposition
      on Schwann cell surfaces in AIDP, confirming complement-mediated pathology.
- name: Macrophage-Mediated Demyelination
  description: >-
    In AIDP, macrophages infiltrate peripheral nerves and strip myelin from
    axons. T cells may also contribute to the inflammatory milieu and
    tissue damage.

      The immunological mechanisms, which include macrophage infiltration, inflammation
      and proliferation of Schwann cells, result in variable degrees of demyelination
      and axonal degeneration.
    explanation: >-
      Describes macrophage infiltration as a key immunological mechanism leading to
      demyelination and axonal degeneration in immune-mediated neuropathies including GBS.

      Vesicular degeneration was seen before the invasion of macrophages into the myelin,
      and was the predominant change in the subject with symptoms for 3 days.
    explanation: >-
      Shows the temporal sequence of pathology in AIDP, with macrophage invasion into
      myelin following initial complement-mediated damage.

      Thus, C. jejuni is now considered as a major triggering agent of GBS. Molecular
      mimicry between sialylated lipooligosaccharide structures on the cell envelope
      of these bacteria and ganglioside epitopes on the human nerves that generates
      cross-reactive immune response results in autoimmune-driven nerve damage.
    explanation: >-
      Establishes C. jejuni as the major triggering infection for GBS through molecular
      mimicry mechanism between bacterial lipooligosaccharides and nerve gangliosides.
