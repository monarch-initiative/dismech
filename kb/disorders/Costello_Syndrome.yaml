description: >
  Costello syndrome is a RASopathy caused by heterozygous germline gain-of-function
  mutations in HRAS, characterized by failure to thrive in infancy, distinctive
  coarse facial features, intellectual disability, cardiac abnormalities (hypertrophic
  cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias), skeletal abnormalities (joint laxity, ulnar deviation),
  and a predisposition to malignancies (rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, bladder
  carcinoma). The syndrome results from constitutive activation of the RAS-MAPK
  signaling pathway.

parents:
- RASopathies
inheritance:
- name: Autosomal Dominant
  description: >
    Autosomal dominant inheritance. Nearly all cases arise de novo due to
    severe phenotype limiting reproductive fitness. Advanced paternal age
    is a risk factor as mutations arise predominantly in the paternal germline.
pathophysiology:
- name: Constitutive RAS-MAPK Activation
  description: >
    HRAS mutations (most commonly G12S, G12A, G13C) cause constitutive
    activation of the RAS protein, leading to enhanced and prolonged
    signaling through the MAPK/ERK pathway. This affects cell proliferation,
    differentiation, and survival in multiple tissues.

    snippet: >-
      CS-associated gain-of-function HRASG12 mutations in induced pluripotent
      stem cells-derived ACMs trigger transcriptional changes associated with
      enhanced automaticity and arrhythmic activity consistent with multifocal
      atrial tachycardia.
    explanation: >-
      iPSC-derived atrial cardiomyocyte model demonstrates that HRAS mutations
      cause transcriptional reprogramming toward pacemaker-nodal phenotype with
      increased automaticity, providing mechanistic basis for arrhythmias.

  description: >
    The same activating HRAS mutations that cause Costello syndrome are found
    as somatic mutations in various cancers. Germline activation creates a
    predisposition to embryonal tumors, particularly rhabdomyosarcoma.

genetic:
- name: HRAS Mutations
  association: Causative
  notes: >
    Heterozygous germline mutations in HRAS cause Costello syndrome. The most
    common mutation is p.Gly12Ser (~80% of cases), followed by p.Gly12Ala and
    p.Gly13Cys. These mutations affect the GTPase activity of HRAS, keeping
    it in the active GTP-bound state. Somatic mosaicism can cause milder phenotypes.
