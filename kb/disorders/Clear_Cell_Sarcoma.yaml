name: Clear Cell Sarcoma
description: >-
  Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), also known as melanoma of soft parts, is a rare
  translocation-driven soft tissue sarcoma characterized by the EWSR1-ATF1 or
  EWSR1-CREB1 fusion genes. Despite its name and melanocytic differentiation
  with expression of melanin and melanocytic markers, CCS is genetically and
  clinically distinct from cutaneous melanoma. The EWSR1-ATF1 fusion activates
  MITF, the master regulator of melanocyte development, explaining the melanocytic
  phenotype. CCS typically affects young adults and arises in deep soft tissues
  of the extremities, often associated with tendons and aponeuroses. It has a
  propensity for lymph node metastasis and poor long-term outcomes.

- name: Classic Clear Cell Sarcoma
  description: >-
    The typical form arising in deep soft tissues of extremities, associated
    with tendons and aponeuroses. Characterized by nests of pale cells with
    melanocytic differentiation.
- name: Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Gastrointestinal Tract
  description: >-
    A related but distinct entity arising in the gastrointestinal tract,
    most commonly stomach or small intestine. Harbors EWSR1-CREB1 fusion
    and has different clinical behavior.
pathophysiology:
- name: EWSR1-ATF1 Fusion Oncogene
  description: >-
    The t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocation fuses the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22
    with ATF1 on chromosome 12 in approximately 90% of cases. The fusion protein
    functions as an aberrant transcription factor that constitutively activates
    MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor), driving melanocytic
    differentiation and survival programs.

- name: MITF Activation
  description: >-
    EWSR1-ATF1 directly activates transcription of MITF, the master transcription
    factor of melanocyte lineage. MITF in turn activates genes involved in
    melanogenesis, cell survival, and proliferation. This explains the melanocytic
    phenotype despite soft tissue origin.

  description: >-
    Downstream of MITF activation, CCS cells express melanocytic markers including
    S100, HMB45, Melan-A, and tyrosinase. Melanin pigment may be present.
    However, unlike melanoma, CCS lacks UV-induced mutations and BRAF/NRAS
    alterations typical of cutaneous melanoma.

biochemical:
- name: EWSR1-ATF1 Fusion Detection
  notes: >-
    RT-PCR or FISH detection of EWSR1-ATF1 (or EWSR1-CREB1) fusion is diagnostic.
    This fusion is essentially pathognomonic and distinguishes CCS from melanoma.
- name: Melanocytic Markers
  notes: >-
    Immunohistochemistry shows expression of melanocytic markers including
    S100, HMB45, Melan-A, and SOX10. Unlike melanoma, CCS lacks BRAF V600E
    mutations.
genetic:
- name: EWSR1-ATF1 Fusion
  association: Somatic Fusion Oncogene
  notes: >-
    The t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocation creates the EWSR1-ATF1 fusion in
    approximately 90% of cases. EWSR1-CREB1 fusion from t(2;22) occurs in
    a minority. These fusions are diagnostic and represent the primary
    oncogenic driver.
