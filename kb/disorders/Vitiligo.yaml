  characterized by the development of white patches due to loss of melanocytes.
  While the depigmented patches and premature hair whitening are the defining
  features, it's important to highlight the frequent association with other
  autoimmune conditions. The psychosocial impact of the condition should also
  not be overlooked. I've adjusted some frequencies based on typical clinical
