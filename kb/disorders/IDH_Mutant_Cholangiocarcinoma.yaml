description: >-
  IDH-mutant cholangiocarcinoma is a molecularly defined subtype of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
  characterized by mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2). IDH mutations occur in
  approximately 15-20% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and cause production of the oncometabolite
  2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and leads to
  widespread epigenetic dysregulation. IDH-mutant cholangiocarcinomas have distinct clinical features
  including younger age at onset and better prognosis compared to IDH wild-type tumors. Ivosidenib,
  a selective IDH1 inhibitor, demonstrated improved progression-free survival in the ClarIDHy trial,
  establishing it as standard therapy for IDH1-mutant cholangiocarcinoma.

pathophysiology:
- name: IDH1/2 Neomorphic Mutation
  description: >-
    IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R140/R172 mutations are neomorphic, conferring a new enzymatic function.
    Instead of converting isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG), mutant IDH converts aKG
    to the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). 2-HG accumulates to millimolar
    concentrations in tumor cells.

    description: Oncometabolite production inhibits aKG-dependent enzymes
- name: 2-HG Accumulation and Dioxygenase Inhibition
  description: >-
    2-HG is structurally similar to alpha-ketoglutarate and competitively inhibits
    aKG-dependent dioxygenases, including TET2 (DNA demethylation), JMJD histone
    demethylases, and prolyl hydroxylases. This leads to widespread epigenetic and
    metabolic dysregulation.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "These mutations result in elevated levels of an oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is associated with higher DNA CpG methylation and altered histone methylation that accompany a block in cellular differentiation."
    explanation: "Abstract links IDH mutations to elevated 2-hydroxyglutarate and epigenetic effects."

    description: JMJD inhibition alters histone methylation landscape
- name: Epigenetic Dysregulation and DNA Hypermethylation
  description: >-
    2-HG inhibition of TET2 blocks conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine,
    causing DNA hypermethylation. This CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) silences
    tumor suppressor genes and differentiation programs, contributing to the block in
    cellular differentiation characteristic of IDH-mutant tumors.

  - target: Differentiation Block and Tumor Growth
    description: Epigenetic silencing impairs normal differentiation programs
- name: Histone Methylation Alterations
  description: >-
    2-HG inhibits Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases, leading to accumulation
    of repressive histone methylation marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3). This contributes to
    transcriptional silencing and the differentiation block.
- name: Differentiation Block and Tumor Growth
  description: >-
    Combined epigenetic alterations block normal cholangiocyte differentiation, maintaining
    cells in a progenitor-like state with proliferative capacity. This promotes tumor
    growth while the cells retain sensitivity to IDH inhibition, which can restore
    differentiation programs.

    IDH1 R132 mutations (R132C, R132H, R132G, R132S, R132L) occur in approximately 15%
    of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. The R132C substitution is most common in
    cholangiocarcinoma (unlike R132H in glioma). Ivosidenib specifically targets IDH1
    mutant protein.
