name: Orofaciodigital Syndrome Type I
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Orofaciodigital syndrome type I (OFD1) is an X-linked dominant ciliopathy caused
  by mutations in the OFD1 gene (also known as CXORF5). It is characterized by
  malformations of the oral cavity (lobulated tongue, oral frenula, cleft palate),
  face (facial asymmetry, hypertelorism), and digits (brachydactyly, syndactyly,
  polydactyly). CNS malformations including agenesis of the corpus callosum and
  polycystic kidneys are common. The condition is typically lethal in males.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Primary Cilia Dysfunction
    description: >
      OFD1 encodes a centrosomal and basal body protein required for
      primary cilium formation. OFD1 is involved in centriole distal
      appendage assembly and ciliogenesis. Loss of function disrupts
      Hedgehog and WNT signaling pathways dependent on primary cilia,
      leading to defects in craniofacial, limb, brain, and kidney
      development.
