    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Obstruction to left ventricular outflow occurs in approximately 60% of
      patients.
    explanation: The provided literature states that obstruction occurs in approximately
      60% of HCM patients, indicating that not all HCM cases are obstructive. Thus,
      the statement that the thickened heart muscle obstructs blood flow out of the
      left ventricle can be recognized as a subtype known as obstructive HCM but does
      not apply to all HCM patients.

    snippet: Left ventricular (LV) wall thickening, or LV hypertrophy (LVH), is common
      and occurs in diverse conditions including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)...
    explanation: The literature indicates that LV hypertrophy (LVH) occurs in HCM
      alongside various conditions. However, it characterizes different forms, not
      solely obstructive HCM, thereby acknowledging the partial correctness of the
      subtype Obstructive HCM but not exclusively.

    snippet: Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is one of the defining
      features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)...
    explanation: This specific literature confirms that left ventricular outflow tract
      obstruction (LVOTO) is a defining feature of HCM, thereby supporting the statement
      regarding the thickened heart muscle obstructing blood flow out of the left
      ventricle.

    obstructed.

      of cardiac morphology and function shown by echocardiography, the patients were
      divided into common type, dilated type, restricted type and reduced ejection
      fraction type.
    explanation: The reference describes non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
      (HCM) as a subtype of HCM characterized by different clinical subtypes based
      on cardiac morphology and function, supporting the statement that non-obstructive
      HCM involves thickened heart muscle without significant obstruction of blood
      flow.

    snippet: Left ventricular (LV) wall thickening, or LV hypertrophy (LVH), is common

      changes that underscore each disease are distinct.
    explanation: This reference supports the statement by acknowledging that hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy can include conditions with thickened heart muscle where the
      histological features differ, indicating diverse subtypes including non-obstructive
      forms.

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Between 2010 and 2018, prevalence increased for ARVC by 180% and HCM
      by 9%.

      correct, recognition of HCM prevalence seems to have increased, indicating it
      could be more common now.
