    label: semantic dementia
description: >-
  Semantic dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized
  by loss of semantic knowledge and language comprehension.
pathophysiology:
- name: Progressive Semantic Network Degeneration
  description: >-
    Neurodegeneration predominantly affecting temporal lobe networks leads to
    impaired naming and single-word comprehension.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:41089414
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Semantic dementia (SD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily
      characterized by core linguistic deficits, notably impaired confrontation naming
      and single-word comprehension."
    explanation: The abstract identifies progressive neurodegeneration with
      semantic language deficits.
- name: Temporal Neocortex Degeneration
  description: >-
    Degeneration of the polar and inferolateral temporal neocortex with relative
    sparing of the hippocampal complex underlies semantic dementia.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:11287367
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Semantic dementia is a recently documented syndrome associated with
      non-Alzheimer degenerative pathology of the polar and inferolateral temporal
      neocortex, with relative sparing (at least in the early stages) of the hippocampal
      complex."
    explanation: The abstract specifies the temporal neocortical pathology and
      relative hippocampal sparing.
phenotypes:

      label: Anomic aphasia
  evidence:

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Semantic dementia (SD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily
      characterized by core linguistic deficits, notably impaired confrontation naming
      and single-word comprehension."
    explanation: Impaired confrontation naming corresponds to anomic aphasia.

    snippet: "Associated features include surface dyslexia, prosopagnosia, relatively
      preserved speech production, and emotional or behavioral abnormalities."
    explanation: The abstract lists surface dyslexia as an associated feature of
      semantic dementia.

  - reference: PMID:41089414
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Associated features include surface dyslexia, prosopagnosia, relatively
      preserved speech production, and emotional or behavioral abnormalities."
    explanation: The abstract lists prosopagnosia as an associated feature of
      semantic dementia.

  category: Neuropsychiatric
  frequency: OCCASIONAL
  phenotype_term:
    preferred_term: Atypical behavior
    term:
      id: HP:0000708
      label: Atypical behavior
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:41089414
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Associated features include surface dyslexia, prosopagnosia, relatively
      preserved speech production, and emotional or behavioral abnormalities."
    explanation: The abstract notes behavioral abnormalities as associated
      features.
treatments:
- name: Speech and Language Therapy
  description: Communication support provided by specialist speech and language
    therapists.
  treatment_term:
    preferred_term: supportive care
    term:
      id: MAXO:0000950
      label: supportive care
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28286641
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "The purpose of this paper is to gain consensus regarding the clinical
      priorities and tasks required in supporting communication needs in those living
      with semantic dementia and their families, by specialist speech and language
      therapists (SLTs), working in clinical practice within dementia care settings
      in the UK."
    explanation: The abstract describes speech and language therapist-led
      communication support for semantic dementia.
