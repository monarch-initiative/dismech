description: >-
  Semantic dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized
  by loss of semantic knowledge and language comprehension.
pathophysiology:
- name: Progressive Semantic Network Degeneration
  description: >-
    Neurodegeneration predominantly affecting temporal lobe networks leads to
    impaired naming and single-word comprehension.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:41089414
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Semantic dementia (SD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by core linguistic deficits, notably impaired confrontation naming and single-word comprehension."
    explanation: The abstract identifies progressive neurodegeneration with semantic language deficits.
- name: Temporal Neocortex Degeneration
  description: >-
    Degeneration of the polar and inferolateral temporal neocortex with relative
    sparing of the hippocampal complex underlies semantic dementia.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:11287367
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Semantic dementia is a recently documented syndrome associated with non-Alzheimer degenerative pathology of the polar and inferolateral temporal neocortex, with relative sparing (at least in the early stages) of the hippocampal complex."
    explanation: The abstract specifies the temporal neocortical pathology and relative hippocampal sparing.

    snippet: "Semantic dementia (SD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by core linguistic deficits, notably impaired confrontation naming and single-word comprehension."
    explanation: Impaired confrontation naming corresponds to anomic aphasia.

    snippet: "Associated features include surface dyslexia, prosopagnosia, relatively preserved speech production, and emotional or behavioral abnormalities."
    explanation: The abstract lists surface dyslexia as an associated feature of semantic dementia.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Associated features include surface dyslexia, prosopagnosia, relatively preserved speech production, and emotional or behavioral abnormalities."
    explanation: The abstract lists prosopagnosia as an associated feature of semantic dementia.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:41089414
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Associated features include surface dyslexia, prosopagnosia, relatively preserved speech production, and emotional or behavioral abnormalities."
    explanation: The abstract notes behavioral abnormalities as associated features.

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "The purpose of this paper is to gain consensus regarding the clinical priorities and tasks required in supporting communication needs in those living with semantic dementia and their families, by specialist speech and language therapists (SLTs), working in clinical practice within dementia care settings in the UK."
    explanation: The abstract describes speech and language therapist-led communication support for semantic dementia.
