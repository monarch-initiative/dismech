name: Acute Myeloid Leukemia, NPM1-Mutated
description: >-
  NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia is characterized by mutations in the
  nucleophosmin 1 gene, occurring in approximately 30% of adult AML cases and
  representing the most common genetic abnormality in AML. NPM1 mutations cause
  aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the normally nucleolar protein, disrupting
  its tumor suppressor functions. In the absence of adverse cytogenetics or
  FLT3-ITD with high allelic ratio, NPM1-mutated AML is classified as favorable
  risk with good response to intensive chemotherapy and favorable overall survival.
  NPM1 mutation status also serves as a sensitive marker for minimal residual disease
  monitoring.

pathophysiology:
- name: NPM1 Cytoplasmic Mislocalization
  description: >-
    NPM1 is a nucleolar phosphoprotein that shuttles between the nucleolus,
    nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. Wild-type NPM1 localizes predominantly to nucleoli
    due to a C-terminal nucleolar localization signal. Mutations in exon 12 disrupt
    this signal and create a nuclear export signal, causing aberrant cytoplasmic
    accumulation (NPMc+). This depletes nucleolar NPM1, disrupting its normal
    functions.

    explanation: This abstract identifies cytoplasmic NPM1 as a hallmark of NPM1-mutated AML, supporting the mislocalization mechanism.

    description: NPM1 mutation upregulates HOXA and HOXB gene clusters
- name: ARF-p53 Pathway Disruption
  description: >-
    Wild-type NPM1 stabilizes the ARF tumor suppressor in the nucleolus. Cytoplasmic
    NPM1 delocalizes ARF, reducing its ability to inhibit MDM2 and stabilize p53.
    This impairs the p53-mediated response to oncogenic stress and DNA damage.

- name: HOX Gene Dysregulation
  description: >-
    NPM1-mutated AML consistently shows upregulation of HOXA and HOXB cluster genes,
    including HOXA9 and MEIS1. These transcription factors promote self-renewal of
    leukemic cells and block normal myeloid differentiation. This HOX signature is
    a defining feature of NPM1-mutated AML.

    NPM1-mutated AML blasts show a characteristic partial differentiation with

    maintain the cells in a progenitor state while allowing some differentiation

    Antibodies detecting cytoplasmic NPM1 (NPMc+) can identify NPM1-mutated

genetic:
- name: NPM1
  association: Somatic Driver Mutation
  notes: >-
    NPM1 mutations are 4-base pair insertions in exon 12, most commonly type A
    (TCTG duplication). Mutations disrupt the C-terminal nucleolar localization
    signal and create a nuclear export signal. NPM1 mutation is mutually
    exclusive with recurrent balanced translocations. When isolated (without
    FLT3-ITD high ratio), confers favorable prognosis.
