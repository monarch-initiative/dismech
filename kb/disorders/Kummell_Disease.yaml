  Kummell disease (also known as Kummell's disease or delayed post-traumatic vertebral
  collapse) is a condition characterized by avascular necrosis of a vertebral body
  following minor spinal trauma. First described by Hermann Kummell in 1891, the disease
  presents with an initial period of relatively minor symptoms after trauma, followed by
  a symptom-free interval, and then progressive painful kyphosis with vertebral body
  collapse. The hallmark radiographic finding is the intravertebral vacuum cleft sign,
  representing gas (nitrogen) accumulation within the necrotic vertebral body. The
  condition predominantly affects elderly patients with osteoporosis and most commonly
  involves the thoracolumbar junction. Treatment ranges from conservative management
  to vertebral augmentation procedures (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) and, in severe
  cases, surgical stabilization.

pathophysiology:
- name: Vertebral body avascular necrosis
  description: >
    Following minor spinal trauma, disruption of the intraosseous blood supply to
    the vertebral body leads to ischemic necrosis of cancellous bone. The osteoporotic
    vertebral body is particularly vulnerable due to its already compromised trabecular
    architecture and vascular supply. The necrotic bone fails to heal through normal
    reparative processes, resulting in progressive structural weakening and eventual
    collapse of the vertebral body. Histopathological examination confirms bone necrosis
    in affected vertebrae.

- name: Basivertebral foramen microcirculation compromise
  description: >
    The basivertebral foramen is a biomechanical weak point where stresses concentrate
    and fracture lines propagate. Specific morphological characteristics of the
    basivertebral foramen, including trapezoidal or irregular shapes and reduced height,
    are associated with Kummell disease. Single-holed basivertebral foramina predominate
    in affected patients (97% vs 76% in controls), suggesting that fewer septations
    contribute to microcirculatory compromise and structural vulnerability.

- name: Intravertebral vacuum cleft formation
  description: >
    Gas accumulation (primarily nitrogen) within the necrotic vertebral body creates
    the characteristic vacuum cleft sign visible on radiographs and CT. This vacuum
    phenomenon results from the inability of the necrotic bone to heal, creating a
    fluid-filled or gas-filled cavity within the vertebral body. The cleft typically
    changes in size with spinal position, enlarging in extension and compressing
    in flexion, reflecting nonunion or pseudarthrosis within the vertebral body.
    Gas clefts appear hypointense on both T1 and T2 MRI, while fluid-filled clefts
    are T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense.

- name: Hypoxia-driven bone remodeling imbalance
  description: >
    Hypoxia and impaired angiogenesis are central to the molecular pathophysiology.
    HIF-1alpha signaling drives adaptive responses including VEGF induction and

    apoptosis and pro-resorptive RANKL signaling favor bone resorption and nonunion.
    The HIF-1alpha/RANKL/Notch1 pathway bidirectionally regulates osteoclast
    differentiation, while osteogenic capacity depends on adequate vascular support
    and osteoblast survival under oxidative stress.

- name: Progressive vertebral body collapse
  description: >
    The combination of avascular necrosis, impaired bone healing, and continued
    mechanical loading leads to progressive collapse of the affected vertebral body.
    This results in increasing kyphotic deformity, which can cause spinal cord
    compression, sagittal imbalance, and secondary complications including
    neurological deficits. In advanced cases (stage III), posterior wall fractures
    develop with neural element compression requiring decompression and fixation.

differential_diagnoses:
- name: Acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture
  description: >
    Standard osteoporotic compression fractures present acutely after trauma
    and typically heal over 6-12 weeks. Unlike Kummell disease, they do not
    have an asymptomatic interval followed by delayed collapse, and they
    lack the intravertebral vacuum cleft sign.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Acute onset of symptoms directly related to trauma without asymptomatic interval
  - Progressive healing on serial imaging rather than delayed collapse
  - Absence of intravertebral vacuum cleft sign
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26806962
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "It is distinguished from typical osteoporotic fractures because the symptoms develop in a delayed fashion."
    explanation: Key distinguishing feature is the delayed symptom development in Kummell disease versus acute onset in typical osteoporotic fractures.
- name: Spinal metastatic disease
  description: >
    Vertebral collapse from metastatic malignancy can mimic Kummell disease on
    imaging. Intravertebral vacuum phenomena occur rarely in metastatic disease.
    Paravertebral soft tissue masses, irregular vertebral destruction, and
    multi-level involvement favor metastatic disease over Kummell disease.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Paravertebral soft tissue mass or abscess typically present
  - Multi-level vertebral involvement common
  - History of primary malignancy
  - Bone scan shows multiple areas of uptake
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:34118526
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "although this radiographic sign is indicative of osteonecrosis, it is not pathognomonic and may be seen in an osteoporotic compression fracture, long-term corticosteroid therapy, myeloma, bone metastasis, acute fracture, osteomyelitis, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, and arteriosclerosis"
    explanation: The intravertebral vacuum cleft is not pathognomonic for Kummell disease and can rarely occur in metastatic disease, necessitating differential consideration.
- name: Multiple myeloma
  description: >
    Plasma cell neoplasm causing lytic bone lesions and vertebral compression
    fractures. Can present with intravertebral vacuum phenomena in rare cases.
    Distinguished by laboratory findings including monoclonal protein, elevated
    serum protein, and characteristic bone marrow biopsy findings.
  disease_term:
    preferred_term: plasma cell myeloma
    term:
      id: MONDO:0009693
      label: plasma cell myeloma
  distinguishing_features:
  - Monoclonal protein on serum or urine protein electrophoresis
  - Multiple lytic bone lesions on skeletal survey
  - Abnormal bone marrow plasma cell infiltration
  - Elevated serum protein with M-spike

    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "IVP occurs rarely in patients with spinal infections and spinal malignancies, for examples, multiple myeloma"
    explanation: Confirms that intravertebral vacuum phenomenon can rarely occur in multiple myeloma, requiring it to be excluded.
- name: Spinal infection (osteomyelitis/tuberculosis)
  description: >
    Vertebral osteomyelitis or spinal tuberculosis can cause vertebral destruction
    and collapse. Kummell disease must be differentiated from infectious causes,
    particularly when presenting with vertebral collapse and back pain in elderly
    patients.
  disease_term:
    preferred_term: tuberculosis, spinal
    term:
      id: MONDO:0043836
      label: tuberculosis, spinal
  distinguishing_features:
  - Disc space involvement and endplate irregularity
  - Paravertebral or epidural abscess formation
  - Elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP)
  - Constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats)
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:34118526
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "The disease has some characteristic (non-diagnostic) features on imaging that help to differentiate it from post-traumatic kyphosis, infection, osteoporotic fracture, or metastatic involvement"
    explanation: Case report and review noting that Kummell disease must be differentiated from infection among other causes of vertebral collapse.
- name: Post-traumatic kyphosis
  description: >
    Progressive kyphotic deformity after significant vertebral trauma. Unlike
    Kummell disease, the initial trauma is typically substantial, the cause of
    collapse is mechanical bone subsidence rather than osteonecrosis, and there
    is no asymptomatic window period.
  distinguishing_features:
  - History of significant trauma rather than trivial injury
  - Direct relationship between trauma severity and deformity
  - Mechanical bone subsidence rather than osteonecrosis
  - Absence of intravertebral vacuum cleft sign
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:34118526
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "KD is not the same as post-traumatic kyphosis, because in the former, the severity of the initial trauma is negligible, and the cause of vertebral body collapse is osteonecrosis, and not simple bone subsidence"
    explanation: Case report explicitly distinguishing Kummell disease from post-traumatic kyphosis based on trauma severity and pathologic mechanism.
environmental:
- name: Osteoporosis
  description: >
    Osteoporosis is the primary predisposing condition for Kummell disease. The
    compromised trabecular architecture and reduced bone mineral density of
    osteoporotic vertebrae make them vulnerable to avascular necrosis following
    even minor trauma. The disease predominantly affects elderly postmenopausal
    patients with osteoporosis.
  effect: Major predisposing factor
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:37353769
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "83 patients with 83 vertebral bodies (T8-L5) diagnosed with senile osteoporosis and Kummell's disease"
    explanation: All Kummell disease patients in this study had concomitant senile osteoporosis, confirming it as a predisposing condition.

    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "BMD (T-score) ≤ - 3.65 and a vertebral compression ratio ≥ 29.9% were strongly correlated with KD (P < 0.001)."
    explanation: ROC analysis identifying BMD T-score ≤ -3.65 as a strong predictor of KD onset, quantifying the severity of osteoporosis required to predispose to the disease.
- name: Minor spinal trauma
  description: >
    A preceding episode of minor or trivial spinal trauma is a typical triggering
    event for Kummell disease. The initial trauma may be so minor that it is
    MRI-negative at the time of injury, yet leads to progressive vertebral body
    collapse months later.
  effect: Triggering event
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:36245398
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "lumbar MRI on sagittal planes were immediately performed following the initial trauma (a ground-level fall) and revealed that the vertebral integrity or connectivity was not interrupted and the marrow signal was even. After an asymptomatic period of 8 months, the back pain reappeared and progressively exacerbated."
    explanation: Case demonstrating that the initial trauma can be MRI-negative with normal marrow signal, yet the patient develops Kummell disease months later.

  description: >-
    Single-cell RNA sequencing of fractured vertebral bone tissue from one OVCF
    patient and one Kummell disease patient. A total of 8,741 single cells were
    captured for transcriptomic analysis, identifying mesenchymal stem cells,
    pericytes, myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, chondrocytes, endothelial cells,
    granulocytes, monocytes, T cells, B cells, plasma cells, mast cells, and
    early erythrocytes.

  conditions:
  - osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture
  - Kummell disease (vertebral avascular necrosis)
  platform: Illumina NovaSeq 6000
  publication: PMID:38161331
  findings:
  - statement: KD tissue shows depletion of mesenchymal stem cells and a relatively suppressed immune system compared to OVCF
  - statement: OVCF exhibits higher osteogenic differentiation capacity owing to abundant immune cells
  - statement: KD results in greater bone resorption than bone formation, with immune imbalance leading to vertebral avascular necrosis
  - statement: CD8-TEM cells and osteoclasts may crosstalk via CD160-TNFRSF14 ligand-receptor interaction
  notes: >-
    The only single-cell transcriptomic dataset directly comparing OVCF and Kummell
    disease tissue. Reveals that transition from OVCF to KD involves MSC depletion
    and immune suppression, supporting the osteoimmune hypothesis of disease
    progression.
