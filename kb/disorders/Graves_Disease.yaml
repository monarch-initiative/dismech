    snippet: After two decades of USI, the prevalence of overt hyperthyroidism (OH),
      Graves'' disease (GD), severe subclinical hyperthyroidism (severe SCH), and
      mild subclinical hyperthyroidism (mild SCH) in mainland China was 0.78%, 0.53%,

    snippet: Graves' disease, one of the autoimmune thyroid diseases, is caused by
      the production of IgG autoantibodies directed against the thyrotropin receptor.
      These antibodies bind to and activate the receptor, causing the autonomous production
      of thyroid hormones.
    explanation: The literature confirms that IgG autoantibodies (which include TSIs)
      activate the thyrotropin receptor, leading to overactive thyroid function.

    snippet: Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by goitre, hyperthyroidism
      and, in 25% of patients, Graves ophthalmopathy. The hyperthyroidism is caused
      by thyroid hypertrophy and stimulation of function, resulting from interaction
      of anti-TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb) with the TSH receptor on thyroid follicular
      cells.
    explanation: The reference supports the statement by describing how Graves' disease
      leads to hyperthyroidism through excessive stimulation of the thyroid gland,
      resulting in increased production of thyroid hormones.
