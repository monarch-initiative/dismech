description: >-
  Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer arising from mesothelial cells
  lining the pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial cavities. It is strongly associated
  with asbestos exposure, with a long latency period of 20-50 years between exposure
  and disease onset. The disease is characterized by diffuse growth along serosal
  surfaces, making complete surgical resection difficult. Germline BAP1 mutations
  define a hereditary cancer syndrome with increased susceptibility to mesothelioma,
  uveal melanoma, and other malignancies.

has_subtypes:
- name: Epithelioid Mesothelioma
  description: >-
    The most common subtype (50-70%), characterized by polygonal cells with
    abundant cytoplasm arranged in tubulo-papillary, trabecular, or solid
    patterns. Has the best prognosis among mesothelioma subtypes.
- name: Sarcomatoid Mesothelioma
  description: >-
    Accounts for 10-20% of cases. Composed of spindle cells arranged in
    fascicles resembling fibrosarcoma. Has the worst prognosis with median
    survival less than one year.
- name: Biphasic Mesothelioma
  description: >-
    Contains both epithelioid and sarcomatoid components, each comprising
    at least 10% of the tumor. Prognosis intermediate between the pure subtypes.
environmental:
- name: Asbestos Exposure
  description: >-
    Asbestos fibers, when inhaled or ingested, become lodged in mesothelial
    tissues where they cause chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA
    damage. The fibers persist indefinitely in tissue and are directly genotoxic,
    causing chromosomal abnormalities and mesothelial cell transformation.
    Occupational exposure accounts for approximately 80% of cases.

pathophysiology:
- name: Asbestos-Induced Mesothelial Injury
  description: >-
    Asbestos fibers penetrate the mesothelium and induce a cycle of cell death
    and regeneration. The fibers generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
    reactive nitrogen species that damage DNA, proteins, and lipids. Chronic
    inflammation driven by frustrated phagocytosis of long fibers promotes
    ongoing tissue damage and malignant transformation.

- name: BAP1 Tumor Suppressor Inactivation
  description: >-
    BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1) is a nuclear deubiquitinase that regulates
    chromatin remodeling, DNA damage response, and cell cycle progression. BAP1
    loss, through germline mutation or somatic inactivation, occurs in 60-70%
    of mesotheliomas and predisposes to malignant transformation. BAP1 loss
    impairs homologous recombination repair and chromatin regulation.

    The NF2 gene encoding merlin is frequently inactivated in mesothelioma

    promoting cell cycle progression, while p14ARF loss compromises p53

    cutaneous melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Somatic BAP1 loss occurs in
    60-70% of sporadic mesotheliomas.
