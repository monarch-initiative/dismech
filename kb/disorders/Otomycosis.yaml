  Otomycosis is a superficial fungal infection of the external auditory canal,
  commonly caused by Aspergillus and Candida species. It accounts for approximately
  5-25% of otitis externa cases worldwide, with higher prevalence in tropical and
  subtropical climates. Predisposing factors include prior antibiotic or steroid
  ear drop use, trauma from ear cleaning, and humid environments. Clinical features
  include pruritus, otalgia, otorrhea, and conductive hearing loss due to fungal
  debris obstructing the ear canal. Otomycosis is increasingly recognized as a
  biofilm-related infection, which contributes to treatment failure and recurrence.
  Management centers on thorough aural toilet followed by topical antifungal agents.

    Aspergillus species are the most common causative agents of otomycosis
    worldwide. In a large Chinese series of 452 cases, A. terreus was the most
    common (62.83%), followed by A. flavus (20.35%) and A. niger (12.17%).
    In other geographic regions, A. niger predominates. Species-level
    identification is important because antifungal susceptibility varies
    significantly between species, with approximately 30% resistance to
    topical azoles (bifonazole and clotrimazole) reported for Aspergillus
    isolates. Azole resistance mechanisms include cyp51A mutations and
    overexpression of efflux pump genes (mdr1, mfs) in Aspergillus section
    Nigri.

    The external auditory canal is normally protected by cerumen, which maintains

    cathelicidin LL-37, lysozyme, lactoferrin, BPI), and supports colonization
    resistance by resident microbiota. Physical or chemical disruption of this
    barrier by excessive ear cleaning, moisture exposure, or other trauma
    removes the primary antimicrobial defense.

    Allergic or irritant contact dermatitis from hearing aids, ear drops,
    or earrings can present with pruritus, erythema, and discharge similar
    to otomycosis. History of allergen exposure and patch testing help
    differentiate.

- name: Cholesteatoma
  description: >
    Cholesteatoma can present with chronic otorrhea, hearing loss, and
    debris in the ear canal. Unlike otomycosis, it involves keratinized
    squamous epithelium in the middle ear and can cause bone erosion and
    serious complications.

  distinguishing_features:
  - Pearly white keratin mass typically arising from the pars flaccida
  - Associated with chronic otitis media and tympanic membrane perforation

- name: Clinical diagnostic criteria for otomycosis
  definition_type: DIAGNOSTIC_CRITERIA
  description: >
    Otomycosis is diagnosed clinically based on characteristic otoscopic
    findings combined with symptomatology and confirmed by mycological
    culture. No single internationally standardized diagnostic criteria
    set exists; diagnosis relies on the triad of compatible symptoms,
    characteristic otoscopic appearance, and positive fungal culture
    or microscopy.

notes: >
  Aspergillus species (particularly A. niger and A. flavus) and Candida species
  (particularly C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis) are the most common causative
  agents. The species distribution varies by geographic region. Molecular
  taxonomy using calmodulin gene sequencing has revealed that many isolates
  previously identified as A. niger are actually A. welwitschiae or A.
  tubingensis (PMID:37257666), which has implications for antifungal susceptibility
  profiling. Emerging Candida species including C. auris (with ERG11p Y132F
  azole resistance mutation) have been isolated from otomycosis cases in
  South Asia (PMID:37367594). Cerumen contains a broad repertoire of
  antimicrobial proteins including defensins (hBD1-3), cathelicidin LL-37,
  lysozyme, lactoferrin, BPI, and immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG). The ABCC11 gene
  polymorphism determines earwax phenotype (wet vs dry) and is associated with
  differences in ear canal microbiota composition, potentially modifying
  susceptibility. Antifungal resistance mechanisms include cyp51A alterations
  in Aspergillus species and biofilm-mediated phenotypic resistance. In a large
  Chinese series (PMID:38578519), topical azole resistance was approximately
  30% among Aspergillus isolates, and cyp51A mutations combined with mdr1/mfs
  efflux pump overexpression contribute to multifactorial azole resistance in
  Aspergillus section Nigri (PMID:38486086). Povidone-iodine (10%) has been
  shown to be a viable alternative to clotrimazole in resource-limited settings
  (PMID:41019825), and nanocrystalline silver demonstrated 89% cure rates in a
  100-patient series (PMID:37223402). Deep learning models using otoendoscopic
  images can achieve 92.42% diagnostic accuracy (PMID:36060244). Novel
  therapeutic approaches under investigation include pterostilbene-loaded PLGA
  nanoparticles that can penetrate fungal biofilm matrix. Refractory cases may
  require topical voriconazole even after prolonged systemic therapy fails
  (PMID:36632528).
