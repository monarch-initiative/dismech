    snippet: "Trachoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with conjunctival strains of Chlamydia trachomatis."
    explanation: The abstract identifies conjunctival C. trachomatis as the cause of trachoma.

    snippet: "Trachoma is a disease complex composed of two linked chronic processes: a recurrent, generally subclinical infectious-inflammatory disease that mostly affects children, and a non-communicable, cicatricial and, owing to trichiasis, eventually blinding disease"
    explanation: The abstract describes chronic infection progressing to cicatricial disease with trichiasis.
