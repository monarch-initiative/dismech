name: Lipoic Acid Synthetase Deficiency
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Lipoic acid synthetase deficiency (OMIM 614462), also known as hyperglycinemia
  with lactic acidosis and seizures (HGCLAS), is a rare autosomal recessive
  mitochondrial disorder caused by biallelic mutations in LIAS, encoding lipoic
  acid synthetase. LIAS catalyzes the insertion of sulfur atoms into octanoyl-GCSH
  to form lipoyl-GCSH, the second step in the mitochondrial lipoylation pathway.
  Loss of function impairs lipoylation of all lipoic acid-dependent enzyme
  complexes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase,
  branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, and the glycine cleavage system. The
  biochemical signature is identical to LIPT2 deficiency (NELABA), with lactic
  acidosis, hyperglycinemia, and combined dehydrogenase deficiency. Clinical
  features include neonatal-onset seizures, severe encephalopathy, hypotonia,
  and failure to thrive. Brain MRI shows cerebral atrophy and white matter
  abnormalities.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Defective lipoic acid synthesis via LIAS deficiency
    description: >
      LIAS encodes lipoic acid synthetase, a mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster
      enzyme that inserts two sulfur atoms into octanoyl-GCSH to generate
      lipoyl-GCSH. This is the second step in the lipoylation pathway, after
      LIPT2-mediated octanoyl transfer and before LIPT1-mediated lipoyl relay to
      the E2 subunits of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenases. LIAS deficiency, like
      LIPT2 deficiency, abolishes lipoylation of all downstream targets including
      the glycine cleavage system. This disrupts pyruvate dehydrogenase,
      alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase,
      and glycine cleavage, causing combined lactic acidosis and hyperglycinemia.

  - name: Combined alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase and glycine cleavage deficiency
    description: >
      Like LIPT2 deficiency, LIAS deficiency impairs lipoylation of all

      and alpha-KGDHc) and amino acid metabolism (via BCKDHc and the glycine
      cleavage system), causing lactic acidosis, hyperglycinemia, and
      accumulation of branched-chain amino acids.
