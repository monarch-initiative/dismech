pathophysiology:
  - name: Enterotoxigenic bacterial infection
    description: >
      Most commonly caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which produces
      heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (STa) enterotoxins that stimulate intestinal fluid
      secretion via cAMP and cGMP signaling. LT activates adenylate cyclase leading to
      increased cAMP, while STa activates guanylate cyclase C (GC-C) leading to increased
      cGMP. Both pathways activate CFTR chloride secretion and inhibit NHE3 sodium
      absorption, causing net fluid secretion.

  - name: Enteropathogenic bacterial infection
    description: >
      Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) uses Type III secretion system effectors to cause
      attaching-and-effacing lesions, microvillus effacement, and tight junction disruption.
      This impairs NaCl absorption and barrier function.
