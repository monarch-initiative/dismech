    label: chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy
description: >-
  A chronic acquired immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by progressive
  or relapsing-remitting symmetric proximal and distal weakness with sensory
  involvement. Distinguished from GBS by duration greater than 8 weeks and
  chronic course.
pathophysiology:
- name: T Cell-Mediated Demyelination
  description: >-
    CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrate peripheral nerves and contribute to
    demyelination. T cells recognize myelin antigens and produce inflammatory
    cytokines that damage Schwann cells.

    snippet: >-
      Autoimmune neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of rare and disabling diseases
      in which the immune system is thought to target antigens in the peripheral
      nervous system: they usually respond to immune therapies.
    explanation: >-
      This pathology review confirms that CIDP involves immune-mediated targeting
      of peripheral nerve antigens, supporting the role of adaptive immunity including
      T cell responses in disease pathogenesis.
- name: Antibody and Complement-Mediated Damage
  description: >-
    Autoantibodies against myelin proteins and nodal/paranodal antigens
    (neurofascin, contactin-1) contribute to demyelination. Complement
    deposition amplifies nerve damage.

      The complement system appears to play a role in promoting macrophage-mediated
      demyelination.
    explanation: >-
      This review establishes the role of complement activation in CIDP pathogenesis,
      linking complement to the amplification of macrophage-mediated nerve damage.

    snippet: >-
      Besides IgG4, subclass IgG3 was detected and associated with complement binding
      and cytotoxic effects in vitro.
    explanation: >-
      Experimental evidence showing that IgG3 subclass antibodies activate complement,
      demonstrating complement-mediated pathogenic mechanisms in autoantibody-positive CIDP.
- name: Macrophage-Mediated Myelin Stripping
  description: >-
    Activated macrophages invade nerve fibers and actively strip myelin from
    axons, causing segmental demyelination visible on nerve biopsy.

      In contrast, the mechanisms of demyelination of other dysimmune neuropathies
      induced by macrophages are unexplained, as no antibodies have been identified
      in such cases.
    explanation: >-
      This pathology review acknowledges macrophage-induced demyelination as a distinct
      mechanism in CIDP, occurring even in cases without identified autoantibodies,
      supporting the role of innate immune responses independent of antibody-mediated damage.

      The proposed mechanisms of action of IVIg that can mediate its therapeutic effects
      are reviewed. These include anti-idiotypic interactions, inhibition of neonatal Fc
      receptors (FcRn), anti-complement activity, upregulation of inhibitory FcγRIIB
      receptors, and downregulation of macrophage activation.
    explanation: >-
      IVIg therapy works in part by downregulating macrophage activation, providing indirect
      evidence that macrophages play a central pathogenic role in CIDP that can be therapeutically
      targeted.

      Sensory CIDP was diagnosed when two inclusion criteria are met: 1) acquired,
      chronic progressive or relapsing symmetrical or asymmetrical sensory polyneuropathy
      that had progressed for >2 months.
    explanation: >-
      This clinical study establishes sensory polyneuropathy as a diagnostic criterion
      and key phenotype of sensory CIDP variant, demonstrating that sensory loss is a
      prominent and treatable feature in CIDP.
