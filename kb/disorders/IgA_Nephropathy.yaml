    label: IgA glomerulonephritis
description: >-
  The most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, characterized by
  mesangial IgA deposits. Caused by galactose-deficient IgA1 and corresponding
  autoantibodies forming immune complexes that deposit in the glomerulus.
  Variable progression from benign hematuria to end-stage renal disease.
pathophysiology:
- name: Galactose-Deficient IgA1 Production
  description: >-
    Aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 with reduced galactose in the hinge region
    is produced by mucosal B cells. This galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1)
    is the key autoantigen in IgA nephropathy.

      The pathogenesis of IgAN is considered a multifactorial process
      involving the formation of immune complexes wherein aberrantly
      O-glycosylated IgA1 is recognized as an autoantigen.
    explanation: >-
      This 2024 review confirms that aberrantly O-glycosylated IgA1 is
      central to IgAN pathogenesis and serves as the autoantigen triggering
      immune complex formation.

    snippet: >-
      Mesangial and circulating IgA1 with aberrantly glycosylated hinge
      region O-glycans characterize IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Unlike healthy
      individuals, some IgA1 is galactose deficient in patients with IgAN,
      leaving terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residues in the hinge region
      exposed.
    explanation: >-
      This landmark study establishes that galactose-deficient IgA1 with
      exposed N-acetylgalactosamine residues is the characteristic molecular
      abnormality in IgAN.
- name: Anti-Gd-IgA1 Autoantibody Formation
  description: >-
    IgG and IgA autoantibodies recognize exposed GalNAc residues on Gd-IgA1.
    These autoantibodies form circulating immune complexes with Gd-IgA1
    that deposit in the glomerular mesangium.

      Circulating autoantibodies that recognize such galactose-deficient
      IgA1 as an autoantigen, or the levels of the autoantigen itself, may
      allow prediction of disease progression.
    explanation: >-
      This study demonstrates that autoantibodies targeting galactose-deficient
      IgA1 are pathogenic in IgAN and correlate with disease progression.

    snippet: >-
      The O-glycosylation status of IgA1 plays a crucial role in disease
      pathophysiology. The level of poorly-O-galactosylated IgA1, or
      galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1), has also been identified as a
      potential biomarker in IgAN.
    explanation: >-
      This 2024 systematic review confirms that Gd-IgA1 is central to IgAN
      pathophysiology and serves as the target for autoantibody formation.
- name: Mesangial Cell Activation and Proliferation
  description: >-
    IgA immune complex deposition activates mesangial cells, causing
    proliferation, matrix expansion, and release of inflammatory mediators
    including cytokines and complement components.

      Mesangial complement C3 deposits, reflecting alternative and possibly
      lectin pathway activation, are characteristic in biopsies of patients
      with IgA nephropathy (IgAN).
    explanation: >-
      This 2024 study confirms that mesangial C3 deposition is a hallmark
      of IgAN, indicating complement activation triggered by immune complex
      deposition in the mesangium.
  - reference: PMID:38053977
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: >-
      The alternative complement pathway is the major complement cascade
      activator in IgAN, and glomerular C3 deposition has been shown to
      correlate with disease progression.
    explanation: >-
      This comprehensive 2023 review establishes that alternative complement
      pathway activation in the mesangium drives IgAN progression.
  - reference: PMID:35781866
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: >-
      Patients with positive glomerular C3 deposition presented with more
      severe clinical and histopathological characteristics and a higher
      score on the Oxford scoring system. With the increasing intensity
      of C3 deposition, IgAN patients were more likely to present with
      high level of microscopic hematuria, fibrous crescents, interstitial
      inflammatory cell infiltration, and a higher score on segmental
      sclerosis lesions.
    explanation: >-
      This study demonstrates that C3 deposition intensity in the mesangium
      correlates with disease severity and progression, supporting the role
      of complement-mediated mesangial injury in IgAN pathophysiology.
