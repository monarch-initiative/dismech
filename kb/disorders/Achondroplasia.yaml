description: >
  Achondroplasia is the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism, affecting approximately
  1 in 15,000-40,000 live births. It is caused by gain-of-function mutations in FGFR3,
  with over 95% of cases resulting from the G380R (c.1138G>A) mutation. The constitutively
  active FGFR3 receptor inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in
  growth
  plate cartilage, leading to impaired endochondral ossification and disproportionate
  short stature with rhizomelic limb shortening, macrocephaly, frontal bossing, and
  characteristic trident hand configuration. Vosoritide, a C-type natriuretic peptide
  analog that antagonizes FGFR3 signaling, was approved by the FDA in 2021 as the
  first
  disease-modifying therapy.

    Achondroplasia follows autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance.
    Approximately 80% of cases arise from de novo mutations, typically in the paternal
    germline with advanced paternal age as a risk factor. Homozygous achondroplasia
    is lethal.

      a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms
      of the disease (10%)."

    snippet: "More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal
      age at the time of conception of affected individuals,"
    explanation: Indicates that most cases are de novo and associated with
      increased paternal age, supporting a paternal origin effect.
pathophysiology:
- name: FGFR3 gain-of-function signaling
  description: >
    The FGFR3 G380R mutation causes constitutive activation of the receptor, leading
    to
    enhanced downstream signaling through STAT1, MAPK, and other pathways. This results
    in premature cell cycle arrest of growth plate chondrocytes, reduced chondrocyte
    proliferation and hypertrophy, and impaired endochondral bone formation. The
    receptor normally serves as a negative regulator of bone growth; its overactivation
    leads to the shortened long bones characteristic of achondroplasia.

      kinase receptor that negatively regulates endochondral bone growth.

    snippet: "DNA studies revealed point mutations in the FGFR3 gene in ACH heterozygotes
      and homozygotes. The mutation on 15 of the 16 ACH-affected chromosomes was the
      same, a G-->A transition, at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA."
    explanation: This landmark 1994 Cell paper by Shiang et al. identified FGFR3
      mutations as the cause of achondroplasia, establishing the molecular basis
      of the disease.

    snippet: "All but one, an atypical case, were found to have a glycine-to-arginine
      substitution at codon 380. Of these, 150 had a G-to-A transition at nt 1138,
      and 3 had a G-to-C transversion at this same position."
    explanation: This study of 154 unrelated achondroplasia patients confirmed
      the G380R mutation is essentially universal, with over 97% having the same
      recurrent mutation.

  description: >
    In the growth plate, FGFR3 overactivation disrupts the normal columnar organization
    of chondrocytes and reduces the height of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones.
    This results in shortened and disorganized growth plates with reduced longitudinal
    bone growth, particularly affecting the long bones of the limbs (rhizomelic pattern)
    and the skull base (leading to foramen magnum stenosis).

notes: >
  Key clinical features include the rhizomelic pattern of limb shortening, relative
  macrocephaly with frontal bossing and midface hypoplasia, trident hand configuration,
  thoracolumbar kyphosis in infancy transitioning to lumbar hyperlordosis, and genu
  varum. Major complications include foramen magnum stenosis with risk of sudden death
  in infancy, progressive spinal stenosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. Intelligence
  is normal. The availability of vosoritide represents a paradigm shift in treatment,
  demonstrating that targeting the underlying molecular defect can improve growth
  outcomes.
