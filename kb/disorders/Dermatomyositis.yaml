description: >-
  An idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterized by proximal muscle weakness
  and distinctive skin manifestations including heliotrope rash and Gottron's
  papules. Associated with increased risk of malignancy and interstitial lung
  disease in certain autoantibody subsets.
pathophysiology:
- name: Complement-Mediated Microangiopathy
  description: >-
    Membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition on endomysial capillaries leads
    to capillary damage, ischemia, and perifascicular atrophy characteristic
    of dermatomyositis. This distinguishes it from polymyositis.

    snippet: >-
      Deposition of complement around capillaries and/or the sarcolemma was
      observed in muscle biopsy specimens from patients with DM, ASS, and IMNM,
      suggesting the pathomechanism of complement-dependent muscle and endothelial
      cell injury.
    explanation: >-
      This evidence demonstrates that complement deposition is a characteristic
      pathological feature of dermatomyositis, contributing to muscle and
      endothelial cell injury through complement-dependent mechanisms.

    snippet: >-
      Juvenile DM is characterized by the loss of capillaries, perivascular
      inflammation, and small-vessel angiopathies, which may be related to
      microinfarction and perifascicular atrophy.
    explanation: >-
      This evidence links the microangiopathy to the characteristic perifascicular
      atrophy observed in dermatomyositis, supporting the ischemic mechanism of
      muscle damage.
- name: Type I Interferon Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    Strong type I interferon signature in muscle and skin. Plasmacytoid
    dendritic cells accumulate in affected tissues and produce IFN-alpha,
    driving inflammation and MxA protein expression.

      The pathological observation of myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA),
      which suggests a type 1 interferon (IFN1) signature in DM, supports the
      diagnosis and further understanding of the pathomechanism of IIM.
    explanation: >-
      MxA expression is a hallmark of type I interferon activation in
      dermatomyositis, providing diagnostic and pathomechanistic insights.

    snippet: >-
      Histopathological studies have revealed critical roles of type I interferons
      and vasculopathy in the development of JDM.
    explanation: >-
      This evidence confirms that type I interferon signaling is a central
      pathogenic mechanism in dermatomyositis, including juvenile forms.
- name: Myositis-Specific Autoantibodies
  description: >-
    Distinct autoantibodies define clinical phenotypes: anti-Mi-2 (classic
    dermatomyositis), anti-MDA5 (amyopathic with ILD), anti-TIF1-gamma
    (cancer-associated), and anti-NXP2 (calcinosis).

      although there are several differences in the prevalence of MSA/MAA and
      autoantibody-phenotype relationships between age and ethnic groups.
    explanation: >-
      This evidence confirms that myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) define
      distinct clinical phenotypes in dermatomyositis, supporting the concept of
      autoantibody-driven disease subtypes.
- name: CD4+ T Cell and B Cell Infiltration

      Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 antibody-positive
      dermatomyositis (anti-MDA5-DM) is frequently complicated by progressive
