description: >-
  A chronic autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by vasculopathy,
  immune dysregulation, and progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs.
  Classified into limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous subtypes based on
  extent of skin involvement.
pathophysiology:
- name: Vascular Injury and Endothelial Dysfunction
  description: >-
    Early endothelial cell injury leads to vascular damage, intimal
    proliferation, and obliterative vasculopathy. Raynaud's phenomenon
    reflects vasospasm and structural vascular changes.

      In systemic sclerosis (SSc, or scleroderma), defective angiogenesis, clinically
      manifesting with abnormal capillary architecture and severe capillary reduction,
      represents a hallmark of early-stage disease, usually preceding the onset of
      tissue fibrosis, and is caused by several cellular and molecular mechanisms
      affecting microvascular endothelial cells with different outcomes.
    explanation: >-
      This evidence supports the early vascular injury mechanism by demonstrating
      that defective angiogenesis and capillary abnormalities precede fibrosis in SSc.
  - reference: PMID:38927538
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      Indeed, once damaged, endothelial cells can be dysfunctionally activated, thus
      becoming unable to undergo angiogenesis and promoting perivascular inflammation.
      They can also undergo apoptosis, transdifferentiate into profibrotic myofibroblasts,
      or acquire a senescence-associated secretory phenotype characterized by the release
      of exosomes and several profibrotic and proinflammatory mediators.
    explanation: >-
      This describes multiple mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction in SSc, including
      impaired angiogenesis, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and inflammatory
      mediator release that contribute to vascular pathology.
- name: Immune Activation and Autoantibody Production
  description: >-
    Characteristic autoantibodies include anti-centromere (limited disease),
    anti-Scl-70/topoisomerase I (diffuse disease), and anti-RNA polymerase III.
    T cells and macrophages infiltrate affected tissues and produce
    pro-fibrotic cytokines.

      Here we report the largest Asian genome-wide association study (GWAS) for
      systemic sclerosis performed to date, based on data from Japanese subjects and
      comprising of 1428 cases and 112,599 controls. The lead SNP is in the FCGR/FCRL
      region, which shows a penetrating association in the Asian population, while a
      complete linkage disequilibrium SNP, rs10917688, is found in a cis-regulatory
      element for IRF8.
    explanation: >-
      This genetic evidence implicates B cell and Fc receptor biology in SSc
      susceptibility, with IRF8 being a key regulator of immune cell development
      and interferon responses that contribute to immune dysregulation.
  - reference: PMID:38296975
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      Prioritizing the top 5% of SNPs of IRF8 binding sites in B cells improves the
      fitting of the polygenic risk scores, underscoring the roles of B cells and
      IRF8 in the development of systemic sclerosis.
    explanation: >-
      This supports the role of B cell biology and autoantibody production in SSc
      pathogenesis, demonstrating that B cell-specific genetic variants contribute
      to disease risk.
- name: Fibroblast Activation and Fibrosis
  description: >-
    TGF-beta signaling drives fibroblast activation and differentiation into
    myofibroblasts. Excessive collagen and extracellular matrix deposition
    leads to progressive fibrosis of skin and internal organs.

      SSc skin demonstrated an increased abundance of COMP+, COL11A1+, MYOC+, CCL19+,
      SFRP4/SFRP2+, and PRSS23/SFRP2+ fibroblasts signatures and decreased proportions
      of CXCL12+ and PI16+ fibroblast signatures in the Prospective Registry of Early
      Systemic Sclerosis and Genetics versus Environment in Scleroderma Outcome Study
      cohorts.
    explanation: >-
      This demonstrates the heterogeneity of fibroblast populations in SSc, with
      increased profibrotic fibroblast subpopulations and decreased normal fibroblast
      signatures contributing to excessive ECM deposition.
  - reference: PMID:38147960
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      The proportions of profibrotic COMP+, COL11A1+, SFRP4/SFRP2+, and PRSS23/SFRP2+
      and proinflammatory CCL19+ fibroblast signatures were positively correlated with
      clinical and histopathological parameters of skin fibrosis, whereas signatures of
      CXCL12+ and PI16+ fibroblasts were inversely correlated.
    explanation: >-
      This provides direct evidence linking specific fibroblast subpopulations to
      clinical severity of skin fibrosis, supporting the role of fibroblast activation
      in SSc pathogenesis and disease progression.
