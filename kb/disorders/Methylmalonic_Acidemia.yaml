description: 'Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of propionate metabolism caused by deficiency
  of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT) or defects in intracellular adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) cofactor synthesis and handling
  (cblA/MMAA, cblB/MMAB). Impaired conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA leads to systemic accumulation of methylmalonic
  acid, propionyl-CoA, 2-methylcitrate, and related metabolites, disrupting mitochondrial anaplerosis, respiratory chain function,
  and protein acylation homeostasis. The disease manifests with recurrent metabolic decompensation, progressive chronic kidney
  disease, neurological injury including basal ganglia necrosis, cardiomyopathy, and a distinctive lipodystrophy-like phenotype.
  Estimated incidence is approximately 1:50,000 live births. Newborn screening via elevated propionylcarnitine (C3) allows
  pre-symptomatic detection and significantly improves outcomes.
