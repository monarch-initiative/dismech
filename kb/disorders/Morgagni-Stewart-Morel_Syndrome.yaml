description: >
  Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the triad of
  hyperostosis frontalis interna (thickening of the inner table of the frontal bone),
  obesity, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. Additional features include endocrine
  disorders such as diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, hyperparathyroidism,
  hyperprolactinemia, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities. The syndrome predominantly
  affects postmenopausal women, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 9:1.
  The etiology remains incompletely understood but is thought to involve endocrine
  imbalance driven by genetic and environmental factors, with prolonged estrogen
  exposure, elevated leptin levels, and growth hormone dysregulation implicated in
  the pathogenesis of the skull thickening.

    has been documented, and X-linked dominant inheritance has not been excluded.

pathophysiology:
- name: Endocrine-mediated calvarial bone overgrowth
  description: >
    The precise pathogenesis of frontal bone thickening remains unclear. Well-supported
    hypotheses include prolonged estrogen exposure stimulating osteoblastic activity
    in the frontal bone inner table (supported by large-scale anthropological studies)
    and elevated leptin levels associated with obesity promoting bone formation. A more
    contested hypothesis involves dysregulated growth hormone secretion from pituitary
    microadenomatosis; however, recent evidence shows no direct causative role for GH
    excess or hyperprolactinemia in HFI etiopathogenesis. The condition predominantly
    affects females and is associated with age, being much less frequent in females
    under 40 years.

    seizures, and cranial nerve dysfunction affecting olfaction and vision.

  description: >
    Hyperostosis frontalis interna is strongly associated with acromegaly and
    hyperprolactinemia, particularly when both conditions coexist. Elevated
    prolactin levels may contribute to menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea,

    and hyperprolactinemia appears to be particularly strong in acromegalic
    patients.

- name: Increased intracranial pressure from frontal bone expansion
  description: >
    Progressive frontal bone thickening can result in increased intracranial pressure
    due to reduced intracranial volume and potential obstruction of CSF flow pathways.
    This increased pressure may contribute to headaches and other neurological symptoms
    observed in MSM syndrome. The mechanism links the skeletal abnormality (hyperostosis)
    to neurological manifestations through biomechanical effects.

    Familial aggregation documented across multiple generations with predominantly
    female involvement. Monozygotic twin concordance supports a genetic basis.
    The specific genes involved have not been identified. Inheritance pattern
    is consistent with autosomal dominant with sex-influenced expression, though
    X-linked dominant inheritance cannot be excluded.

  notes: >
    Hyperostosis frontalis interna is found in approximately 2.5% of the general
    population, though full Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome with the complete
    triad is much rarer. The condition is approximately 9 times more common
    in females than males and increases in frequency with age.

notes: >
  Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome was first described by Giovanni Battista Morgagni
  in 1719 in an obese female with hirsutism found to have frontal hyperostosis at
  autopsy. Stewart reported three autopsy cases in 1928, and Morel described the
  first living case in 1930. The syndrome remains poorly understood, with debate
  about whether it represents a distinct entity or a syndrome complex. Diagnosis
  is based on the radiological finding of hyperostosis frontalis interna combined
  with obesity and neuropsychiatric features. There is ongoing debate about the
  existence of the syndrome as a unified entity given the high prevalence of HFI
  in the general population. A high prevalence and a lack of studies demonstrating
  a strong correlation between the different signs currently question the existence
  of the syndrome as a discrete entity.
