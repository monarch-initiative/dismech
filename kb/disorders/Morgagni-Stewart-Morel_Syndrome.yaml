name: Morgagni-Stewart-Morel Syndrome
category: Complex
description: >
  Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the triad of
  hyperostosis frontalis interna (thickening of the inner table of the frontal bone),
  obesity, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. Additional features include endocrine
  disorders such as diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, hyperparathyroidism,
  hyperprolactinemia, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities. The syndrome predominantly
  affects postmenopausal women, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 9:1.
  The etiology remains incompletely understood but is thought to involve endocrine
  imbalance driven by genetic and environmental factors, with prolonged estrogen
  exposure, elevated leptin levels, and growth hormone dysregulation implicated in
  the pathogenesis of the skull thickening.

  description: >
    Multiple-generation family studies and monozygotic twin concordance suggest
    autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable
    expressivity. Hyperostosis frontalis interna has been found in multiple
    generations of affected families, though no case of male-to-male transmission
    has been documented, and X-linked dominant inheritance has not been excluded.

      hyperostosis frontalis interna, obesity, shortness and cognitive impairment.
      They both have suffered from generalized seizures since their early adulthood."
    explanation: Monozygotic twin concordance for MSM syndrome features strongly
      supports a genetic basis for the disorder.

    explanation: The authors explicitly conclude that the concordance in 
      monozygotic twins indicates a genetic basis for MSM syndrome.
pathophysiology:
- name: Endocrine-mediated calvarial bone overgrowth
  description: >
    The precise pathogenesis of frontal bone thickening remains unclear. Leading
    hypotheses implicate prolonged estrogen exposure stimulating osteoblastic
    activity in the frontal bone inner table, elevated leptin levels associated
    with obesity promoting bone formation, and dysregulated growth hormone
    secretion from pituitary microadenomatosis contributing to hyperostosis.
    The condition predominantly affects females and is associated with age,
    being much less frequent in females under 40 years.

      genetic/epigenetic factors instead.
- name: Neurological compression from calvarial thickening

    Progressive thickening of the frontal bone inner table can lead to compression
    of underlying brain parenchyma, particularly the frontal lobes. This mechanical
    compression may result in cerebral atrophy, cognitive impairment,
    neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression and anxiety, headaches,
    seizures, and cranial nerve dysfunction affecting olfaction and vision.

    lesion with contrast enhancement on imaging, unlike the diffuse bilateral 
    inner table thickening of HFI.
- name: Fibrous dysplasia
  distinguishing_features:
  - Fibrous dysplasia involves replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue 
    and has a ground-glass appearance on imaging, affecting the diploe rather

notes: >
  Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome was first described by Giovanni Battista Morgagni
  in 1719 in an obese female with hirsutism found to have frontal hyperostosis at
  autopsy. Stewart reported three autopsy cases in 1928, and Morel described the
  first living case in 1930. The syndrome remains poorly understood, with debate
  about whether it represents a distinct entity or a syndrome complex. Diagnosis
  is based on the radiological finding of hyperostosis frontalis interna combined
  with obesity and neuropsychiatric features. There is ongoing debate about the
  existence of the syndrome as a unified entity given the high prevalence of HFI
  in the general population.
