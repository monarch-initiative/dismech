description: >-
  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy, typically arising
  in the setting of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Major risk factors include chronic
  hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol-related liver disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated
  steatotic liver disease (MASLD/NAFLD). HCC pathogenesis involves multiple molecular pathways
  including WNT/beta-catenin, TP53, telomere maintenance, and chromatin remodeling. The
  combination of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) plus bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) has established
  immunotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced HCC, based on the IMbrave150 trial.

- name: Viral Hepatitis-Associated HCC
  description: >-
    HCC arising in the context of chronic hepatitis B or C infection. HBV can be directly
    oncogenic through viral integration, while HCV promotes HCC primarily through cirrhosis
    and chronic inflammation.
- name: Alcohol-Related HCC
  description: >-
    HCC arising in alcohol-related liver disease and cirrhosis. Associated with specific
    molecular features and generally presents at more advanced stage.
- name: MASLD-Associated HCC
  description: >-
    HCC arising in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (formerly NAFLD/NASH).
    Increasingly common subtype that can occur even without cirrhosis. May have distinct
    immune microenvironment features affecting immunotherapy response.
- name: Fibrolamellar HCC
  description: >-
    Rare variant occurring in younger patients without cirrhosis. Characterized by DNAJB1-PRKACA
    fusion. Distinct clinical behavior and treatment considerations.
pathophysiology:
- name: Chronic Liver Injury and Cirrhosis
  description: >-
    Most HCC arises in the context of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Persistent
    hepatocyte death and regeneration in an inflammatory environment promotes accumulation
    of genetic alterations. Cirrhosis itself is a premalignant condition with ongoing
    oxidative stress and genomic instability.

    snippet: HCC typically arises in patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases.
    explanation: This abstract states that HCC commonly arises in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, supporting the mechanism described.

  description: >-
    Chronic hepatocyte proliferation leads to telomere shortening, causing genomic instability.
    TERT promoter mutations, which are the most common HCC mutations, reactivate telomerase
    to enable unlimited replication. This creates a checkpoint bypass allowing survival
    of genetically unstable cells.

    Multiple driver genes are recurrently mutated in HCC, including TERT promoter (60%),
    TP53 (30%), CTNNB1 (30%), AXIN1 (10%), and ARID1A (10%). These mutations affect
    telomere maintenance, cell cycle control, WNT signaling, and chromatin remodeling.

    Activating mutations in CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) or inactivating mutations in AXIN1
    lead to constitutive WNT pathway activation. This drives cell proliferation and is
    associated with a distinct molecular subclass of HCC with specific clinical features

    HCC is a highly vascular tumor dependent on angiogenesis. VEGF signaling promotes
    new blood vessel formation supplying the tumor. VEGF also has immunosuppressive
    effects, contributing to the immune-excluded microenvironment. This provides the
    rationale for anti-VEGF therapy in combination with immunotherapy.

biochemical:
- name: Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)
  notes: >-
    Serum AFP is elevated in approximately 60% of HCC cases. Levels greater than 400 ng/mL
    are highly specific for HCC in the setting of cirrhosis. Used for diagnosis (with
    imaging) and monitoring treatment response. AFP-L3 fraction improves specificity.
- name: Liver Function Tests
  notes: >-
    Elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin may occur. Pattern depends
    on underlying liver disease and tumor burden. Child-Pugh score assesses hepatic reserve
    and guides treatment decisions.
- name: PIVKA-II (DCP)
  notes: >-
    Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin is an alternative biomarker to AFP. May be elevated
    when AFP is normal. Useful in combination with AFP for surveillance and diagnosis.
genetic:
- name: TERT Promoter
  association: Somatic Activating Mutation
  notes: >-
    TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C250T) are the most common genetic alterations in HCC,
    present in approximately 60% of cases. These mutations create binding sites for ETS
    transcription factors, reactivating telomerase expression and enabling unlimited
    cell division.
- name: TP53
  association: Somatic Loss of Function
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in approximately 30% of HCC, enriched in HBV-associated and
    aflatoxin-associated tumors. The R249S hotspot mutation is specifically associated
    with aflatoxin B1 exposure.
- name: CTNNB1
  association: Somatic Activating Mutation
  notes: >-
    CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) mutations occur in approximately 30% of HCC, causing constitutive
    WNT pathway activation. Associated with distinct clinical features including
    cholestasis and immune exclusion, potentially affecting immunotherapy response.
- name: AXIN1
  association: Somatic Loss of Function
  notes: >-
    AXIN1 inactivating mutations occur in approximately 10% of HCC, also activating
    WNT signaling. AXIN1 and CTNNB1 mutations are typically mutually exclusive.
- name: ARID1A
  association: Somatic Loss of Function
  notes: >-
    ARID1A mutations affect chromatin remodeling and occur in approximately 10% of HCC.
