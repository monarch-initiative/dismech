description: >
  Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), also known as progressive diaphyseal dysplasia,
  is an autosomal dominant sclerosing bone disorder caused by mutations in TGFB1
  encoding transforming growth factor beta 1. It is characterized by progressive
  cortical thickening (hyperostosis) of the diaphyses of long bones, leading to
  limb pain, muscle weakness, waddling gait, and easy fatigability. Skull involvement
  can cause cranial nerve palsies, particularly facial nerve paralysis and hearing
  loss. The disease typically presents in childhood and shows variable expressivity.

pathophysiology:
- name: Constitutive TGF-beta 1 Activation
  description: >
    Mutations in TGFB1 affect the latency-associated peptide (LAP) region,
    disrupting the non-covalent association between LAP and mature TGF-beta 1.
    This leads to premature or excessive release of active TGF-beta 1 from its
    latent complex, resulting in increased osteoblast activity and cortical
    bone thickening in the diaphyses.
