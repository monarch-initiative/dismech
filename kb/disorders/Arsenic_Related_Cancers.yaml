name: Arsenic-Related Cancers
description: >-
  Arsenic-related cancers comprise a spectrum of malignancies caused by chronic
  exposure to inorganic arsenic, a Group 1 human carcinogen. The primary sites
  affected include skin (squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas), lung, and urinary
  bladder. Arsenic exposure occurs through contaminated drinking water, occupational
  exposure (mining, smelting), and certain traditional medicines. The carcinogenic
  mechanisms involve oxidative stress, epigenetic alterations, genomic instability,
  and impaired DNA repair without direct DNA adduct formation. Arsenic-related skin
  cancers are preceded by characteristic premalignant lesions including palmar/plantar
  keratoses and Bowen disease. Endemic regions include Bangladesh, West Bengal, Taiwan,
  Chile, and Argentina where groundwater contamination affects millions.

  description: >-
    Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic through contaminated drinking water is the
    primary route of exposure affecting large populations. Occupational exposure occurs
    in mining, smelting, pesticide manufacturing, and wood preservation. The latency
    period between exposure and cancer development is typically 20-40 years. Arsenic
    is methylated in the liver to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic
    acid (DMA); the intermediate MMA(III) is particularly toxic. Individual variation
    in arsenic metabolism affects cancer susceptibility.

pathophysiology:
- name: Arsenic Uptake and Metabolism
  description: >-
    Inorganic arsenic is absorbed from the gut or lungs and undergoes hepatic
    methylation by arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT). The
    metabolic pathway produces monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic
    acid (DMA). The trivalent intermediate MMA(III) is highly reactive and toxic.
    Genetic polymorphisms in AS3MT affect methylation efficiency and cancer risk.

- name: Oxidative Stress and DNA Damage
  description: >-
    Arsenic generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) through multiple mechanisms
    including mitochondrial dysfunction and NADPH oxidase activation. ROS cause
    oxidative DNA damage including 8-oxoguanine formation, DNA strand breaks,
    and chromosomal aberrations. Unlike classic genotoxins, arsenic does not
    form direct DNA adducts but induces damage through indirect mechanisms.

  description: >-
    Arsenic causes global DNA hypomethylation while inducing promoter-specific
    hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. This occurs partly through
    competition for methyl groups (arsenic methylation depletes SAM) and
    altered DNMT activity. Histone modifications and miRNA expression are
    also affected, contributing to aberrant gene expression patterns.

- name: Impaired DNA Repair
  description: >-
    Arsenic inhibits multiple DNA repair pathways including nucleotide excision
    repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. It inhibits zinc finger
    proteins involved in repair by displacing zinc. PARP-1, XPA, and other
    repair factors are direct targets. This repair deficiency synergizes with
    oxidative damage to promote mutagenesis.

    Arsenic-induced promoter hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes

biochemical:

  notes: >-
    Total urinary arsenic and speciated arsenic metabolites (inorganic arsenic,
    MMA, DMA) serve as biomarkers of recent exposure. The proportion of MMA
    correlates with cancer risk - individuals with higher %MMA have increased
    susceptibility.

    Arsenic concentrations in hair and nails reflect longer-term exposure
    (weeks to months) due to keratin binding. Used for exposure assessment
    in epidemiologic studies.

  notes: >-
    Polymorphisms in arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT)
    affect arsenic methylation efficiency. Individuals with lower methylation
    capacity accumulate more toxic trivalent metabolites and have increased
    cancer risk.

    Glutathione S-transferase omega (GSTO) polymorphisms affect arsenic
    reduction and detoxification, modifying cancer susceptibility in

  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in arsenic-related skin and bladder cancers,
    though mutation spectra differ from UV-induced or smoking-related
    cancers, reflecting distinct carcinogenic mechanisms.
treatments:
- name: Exposure Cessation
  description: >-
    Elimination of arsenic exposure is the primary intervention. Providing
    clean water through wells drilled to arsenic-free aquifers, water
    treatment systems, or alternative sources dramatically reduces ongoing
    exposure and may stabilize premalignant lesions.
  notes: >-
    Public health interventions including arsenic testing of water sources,
    provision of arsenic-free water, and community education are critical.
