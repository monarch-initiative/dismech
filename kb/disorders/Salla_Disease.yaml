  - name: Intermediate-Severe Salla Disease
    description: Intermediate severity variant with onset in infancy, developmental
      plateau in childhood, followed by progressive neurological regression in adolescence.
      More severe than classic Salla disease with progressive neurological regression
      in adolescence. Typically carries different SLC17A5 variants (e.g., splice site
      mutations). Lifespan extends into adolescence/adulthood but with continued neurological decline.

        snippet: "Disease onset occurred within the first six months of life in both patients.
          Early childhood development was delayed with achievement of some milestones
          followed by a developmental plateau in late childhood. After this, both patients
          began a slow and progressive neurological regression in adolescence."

          Salla disease as distinct from classic form with progressive regression.

        snippet: "Likely pathogenic variants in SLC17A5 results in allelic disorders
          of free sialic acid metabolism including (1) infantile free sialic acid storage
          disease with severe global developmental delay, coarse facial features,
          hepatosplenomegaly, and cardiomegaly; (2) intermediate severe Salla disease with
          moderate to severe global developmental delay, hypotonia, and hypomyelination
          with or without coarse facial features, and (3) Salla disease with normal
          appearance, mild cognitive dysfunction, and spasticity."
        explanation: Comprehensive literature review and case report of intermediate-severe
          Salla disease identifies hypomyelination, developmental delay, and hypotonia as
          characteristic features, with compound heterozygous SLC17A5 variants. Demonstrates
          that normal or marginally elevated urine sialic acid cannot exclude this phenotype.
prevalence:
  - population: Global
    percentage: Rare
    notes: >
      Worldwide prevalence estimated at less than 1 per 1,000,000 individuals.
      Approximately 200-260 cases of FSASD (including all clinical forms) reported worldwide.
      Salla disease (classic mild form) reported in approximately 150 individuals,
      predominantly of Finnish and Swedish descent. Likely underdiagnosed given rarity and non-specific clinical presentation.

      Diagnostic delay is a significant clinical challenge: median age at disease onset is 0.17 years (approximately 2 months), but median age at diagnosis is 3 years, resulting in a median diagnostic delay of 2.5 years. Median survival across all FSASD phenotypes is 11 years, though this varies substantially based on biochemical severity and clinical phenotype. Patient distribution is panethnic.

  - population: Finland and Scandinavia
    percentage: 1-9 per million (Salla region)
    notes: >
      Significantly higher prevalence in Finland and Scandinavia due to founder effect.
      In Salla region of Finland specifically, estimated prevalence is 1-9 per 1,000,000.
      Carrier frequency of the common p.Arg39Cys (R39C) SLC17A5 founder variant is approximately 1 per 100 individuals in the Salla region,
      accounting for the geographic clustering of cases. The majority of reported FSASD cases are of Finnish or Swedish ancestry,
      reflecting the high founder mutation carrier frequency in these populations.

    description: SLC17A5 mutations result in loss or substantial reduction of sialin
      protein expression or function. Sialin is a 12-transmembrane transporter required
      for proton-coupled export of free sialic acid (Neu5Ac) from lysosomes to cytosol.

  - name: Lysosomal Free Sialic Acid Accumulation
    description: Loss of sialin function impairs export of free N-acetylneuraminic
      acid (Neu5Ac) from lysosomes. Neu5Ac accumulates in lysosomes, leading to lysosomal
      enlargement, dysfunction, and cellular stress. This is the hallmark biochemical
      feature of FSASD including Salla disease. Cellular imaging shows prominent cytoplasmic
      vacuolation in fibroblasts from affected individuals.

        snippet: "Free sialic acid storage disorders (FSASDs) result from pathogenic variations
          in the SLC17A5 gene, which encodes the lysosomal transmembrane protein sialin."
        explanation: Studies of patient-derived cells demonstrate SLC17A5 biallelic mutations
          as causative for FSASD including Salla disease.

        snippet: "SLC17A5 gene sequencing was initiated with no sequence variants identified;
          however, the assay failed to amplify exons 8 and 9, prompting an exon-level copy-number
          analysis that revealed a novel homozygous deletion of exons 8 and 9, inherited from
          heterozygous carrier parents."
        explanation: Case report documents a novel homozygous deletion of SLC17A5 exons 8-9
          causing infantile-onset FSASD with prenatal hydrops, demonstrating the spectrum of
          SLC17A5 pathogenic variants extends beyond point mutations to exonic deletions.

        snippet: "Individuals with FSASD exhibited significantly higher levels of free
          Neu5Ac compared to their unaffected biological parents (36-fold)"
        explanation: Free sialic acid accumulation is the pathognomonic biochemical feature
          and a diagnostic biomarker in FSASD.

          with high levels of free sialic acid in urine by biochemical detection in
          second-tier tests newborn screening"
        explanation: Newborn screening case report demonstrates early detection of elevated
          urinary free sialic acid as a diagnostic marker, enabling early identification of
          asymptomatic FSASD before clinical manifestations.

          with a urinary free sialic acid excretion below 6.37-fold or an intracellular
          free sialic acid storage in fibroblasts below 7.37-fold of the mean of normal
          survived longer than patients with biochemical values above these thresholds."
        explanation: Large cross-sectional study of 116 FSASD cases demonstrates that
          biochemical biomarker levels (urinary and intracellular free sialic acid) are
          strong predictors of disease progression and survival, with thresholds of 6.37-fold
          (urine) and 7.37-fold (fibroblasts) distinguishing slower and faster disease courses.

      The Myelin Disorders Biorepository Project (MDBP) and Global Leukodystrophy
      Initiative Clinical Trials Network is an international research initiative that
      collects and analyzes clinical data and biological samples from leukodystrophy
      patients worldwide. The MDBP is one of the world's largest leukodystrophy

      term:

        label: free sialic acid storage disease, infantile form
    description: Most severe form of FSASD with earlier onset (typically first weeks
      to months of life), rapid neurodegeneration, and shortened lifespan. Presents
      with severe hypotonia and profound developmental impairment, often fatal by early
      childhood.
    notes: Infantile FSASD presents earlier than classic Salla disease (typically first
      weeks vs first year) with more severe phenotype and faster disease progression.
      Caused by biallelic SLC17A5 mutations but typically with more deleterious variants.
      Related to Salla disease within the free sialic acid storage disease spectrum but
      represents the severe end of the clinical continuum.

    description: Lysosomal storage disorder with overlapping neurological manifestations
      including developmental delay, hypotonia, ataxia, and white matter abnormalities on MRI.
    notes: Can mimic Salla disease clinically but caused by mutations in NPC1/NPC2 genes
      (not SLC17A5). Characterized by cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes rather than
      sialic acid. Biochemical testing shows elevated cholesterol instead of elevated free
      sialic acid. Different enzyme panel on lysosomal storage disease screening.
