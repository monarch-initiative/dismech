      Patients meeting clinical criteria for CINCA/NOMID but without
      detectable NLRP3 mutations by conventional sequencing. Many of
      these cases harbor somatic mosaicism for NLRP3 mutations detectable
      only by deep sequencing, with variant allele fractions as low as

  - name: NLRP3 gain-of-function mutation
    description: >
      Heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 gene (encoding
      cryopyrin) lower the activation threshold for NLRP3 inflammasome
      assembly. Most CINCA/NOMID mutations are de novo, arising
      post-zygotically or in the germline. The NLRP3 protein contains a
      pyrin domain, a NACHT domain, and leucine-rich repeats; disease
      mutations cluster in the NACHT domain and disrupt autoinhibitory
      conformations.

    description: >
      Mutant cryopyrin undergoes spontaneous oligomerization and
      constitutive assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, comprising
      NLRP3, ASC (PYCARD), and pro-caspase-1. NEK7 serves as a scaffold
      facilitating NLRP3 activation via microtubule organizing center
      trafficking. The resulting continuous activation of caspase-1
      occurs without normal requirement for exogenous danger signals.
      ASC speck formation, the hallmark of inflammasome assembly, is
      enhanced in patient myeloid cells and suppressible by MCC950.

      response and promoting Th1-polarized inflammation. Elevated
      serum IL-18 levels are a feature of CAPS and contribute to
