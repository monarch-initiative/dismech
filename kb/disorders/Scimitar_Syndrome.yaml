  Scimitar syndrome (also known as pulmonary venolobar syndrome or hypogenetic
  lung syndrome) is a rare congenital cardiovascular malformation characterized
  by partial or complete anomalous pulmonary venous return from the right lung to the
  inferior vena cava, resulting in a left-to-right shunt. The syndrome's name derives
  from the characteristic curvilinear shadow on chest radiograph formed by the
  anomalous vein, resembling a Turkish curved sword (scimitar). The condition is
  frequently associated with right lung hypoplasia, dextroposition of the heart,
  anomalous systemic arterial supply to the right lower lobe from the aorta, and
  other cardiac defects including atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect.
  Presentation exhibits a clear bimodal pattern with either an infantile form
  characterized by heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and significant mortality,
  or a pediatric/adult form that is milder and may be asymptomatic on diagnosis.
  Treatment depends on symptom severity and hemodynamic significance, with surgical
  repair indicated for significant left-to-right shunting.

  - name: Embryologic developmental disruption
    description: >
      The anomalies in scimitar syndrome arise from disrupted cardiopulmonary
      embryogenesis during the fourth to fifth week of gestation. Faulty incorporation
      of the common pulmonary vein into the left atrium results in the anomalous
      venous drainage, while abnormal branching morphogenesis of the right lung
      bud produces ipsilateral pulmonary hypoplasia. Aberrant systemic arterial
      connections and bronchopulmonary sequestration reflect concurrent errors in
      vascular patterning. The exact triggers are unknown, and no consistent
      environmental teratogenic exposure has been identified. The condition is
      typically sporadic.

  - name: Anomalous pulmonary venous drainage
    description: >
      The hallmark of scimitar syndrome is partial or complete anomalous drainage of
      the right pulmonary veins into the inferior vena cava (IVC) rather than the left
      atrium. This creates a left-to-right shunt as oxygenated blood from the right
      lung is returned to the systemic venous circulation instead of the left heart.
      The anomalous vein typically drains into the IVC at or below the diaphragm,
      though supradiaphragmatic and hepatic vein drainage variants exist. The
      hemodynamic significance depends on the proportion of pulmonary venous drainage
      that is anomalous and the degree of associated right lung hypoplasia.

  - name: Right lung hypoplasia
    description: >
      The right lung is hypoplastic in most cases, ranging from mild volume reduction
      to severe underdevelopment with only one or two lobes. Right lung hypoplasia
      reduces the volume of blood flow through the anomalous circuit, which may
      paradoxically limit the hemodynamic impact of the left-to-right shunt. The
      hypoplasia results in dextroposition of the heart (shifting of the mediastinum
      to the right) rather than true dextrocardia. Right pulmonary artery hypoplasia
      frequently accompanies lung hypoplasia, further reducing the pulmonary vascular bed.

  - name: Anomalous systemic arterial supply
    description: >
      An anomalous systemic artery arising from the thoracic or abdominal aorta
      supplies part of the right lower lobe in many cases. This arterial supply
      creates an additional left-to-right shunt by delivering systemic-pressure blood
      to the pulmonary vascular bed, contributing to pulmonary overcirculation and
      pulmonary hypertension. Bronchopulmonary sequestration frequently coexists,
      and aortopulmonary collateral arteries may also be present.

  - name: Pulmonary hypertension pathogenesis
    description: >
      Pulmonary hypertension in scimitar syndrome arises from multiple converging
      factors. The left-to-right shunt from anomalous venous drainage produces
      pulmonary overcirculation; right lung hypoplasia reduces the pulmonary vascular
      bed; anomalous systemic arterial supply adds high-pressure systemic inflow; and
      stenosis or obstruction of the scimitar vein elevates post-capillary pressure.
      These factors drive vascular remodeling including endothelial dysfunction and
      smooth muscle cell hypertrophy in small pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary
      hypertension is the major determinant of prognosis, especially in infants.

  - name: Associated atrial septal defect
    description: >
      Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common cardiac malformations
      associated with scimitar syndrome, reported in approximately 18-43% of cases.
      ASD compounds the left-to-right shunt already present from the anomalous
      pulmonary venous drainage, increasing right heart volume overload. ASD may
      mask the diagnosis of scimitar syndrome by providing an apparent explanation
      for the shunt on echocardiography.

      Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is reported in approximately 27% of scimitar
      syndrome cases, creating an additional left-to-right shunt at the ventricular
      level. Combined with the anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, VSD further

    notes: >
      The infantile form presents in the first year of life with severe symptoms
      including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, failure to thrive, and
      respiratory distress. It is associated with more severe right lung hypoplasia,
      larger shunt volumes, higher incidence of aortopulmonary collaterals and right
      pulmonary artery hypoplasia, and a higher incidence of associated cardiac defects.
      Carries significant mortality (37-47%) even with intervention. Infantile onset

      is typically smaller due to right lung hypoplasia limiting flow through the
