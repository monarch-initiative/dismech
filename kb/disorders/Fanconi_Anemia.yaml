name: Fanconi_Anemia
description: Fanconi anemia is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized
  by genomic instability, congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure,
  and increased susceptibility to malignancies. It results from biallelic mutations
  in genes encoding components of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway.
