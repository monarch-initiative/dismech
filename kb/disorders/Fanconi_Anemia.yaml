name: Fanconi_Anemia
description: >-
  Fanconi anemia is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized
  by genomic instability, congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure,
  and increased susceptibility to malignancies. It results from biallelic mutations
  in genes encoding components of the Fanconi anemia/BRCA DNA interstrand crosslink
  repair pathway. At least 22 complementation groups have been identified, with
  FANCA accounting for 60-70% of cases. The phenotypic spectrum is highly variable
  even within the same complementation group, reflecting genetic modifiers and
  environmental factors.
