  phase: PHASE_II
  status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
  description: Phase II clinical trial evaluating lentiviral-mediated gene therapy for pediatric patients with Fanconi Anemia subtype A (FA-A). Autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells are transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene, then reinfused with the goal of preventing bone marrow failure.

    snippet: "This is an open-label Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a hematopoietic cell-based gene therapy for pediatric patients with Fanconi Anemia, subtype A (FA-A). Hematopoietic stem cells from mobilized peripheral blood of patients with FA-A will be transduced ex vivo (outside the body) with a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene."
    explanation: This Phase II gene therapy trial directly addresses the genetic defect in FA-A by correcting FANCA mutations in autologous stem cells, providing evidence for curative cell-based genetic therapy approaches.

  description: Pilot trial evaluating oxandrolone (an androgen steroid) for treatment of bone marrow aplasia in Fanconi Anemia patients. The study assessed safety and efficacy of androgen therapy to stimulate production of red blood cells and platelets in FA patients with bone marrow failure.

    snippet: "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the drug oxandrolone (a type of androgen steroid) in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), and to determine if this drug can help in the treatment of bone marrow failure in these patients. Androgen steroids are male hormones that can stimulate the production of red blood cells (the cells which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help blood clot)."
    explanation: This Phase I trial evaluates androgen therapy as a bridge treatment for bone marrow failure in FA, providing clinical evidence for hormonal stimulation of hematopoiesis.

  phase: PHASE_II
  status: COMPLETED
  description: Phase I/II study evaluating cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin conditioning followed by matched sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with Fanconi Anemia. Investigates reduced-intensity conditioning regimens tailored to FA patients' increased chemotherapy sensitivity.

    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "Giving chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, before a donor stem cell transplant helps to remove the patient's cells to allow for the transplant cells to take and grow. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells."
    explanation: This Phase I/II trial optimizes HSCT conditioning regimens for FA patients, providing clinical evidence for the curative approach to bone marrow failure in Fanconi Anemia.
notes: Fanconi Anemia is a complex condition that requires multidisciplinary management
  and regular monitoring to address both hematologic and systemic complications.
