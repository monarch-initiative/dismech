name: Fanconi_Anemia
description: Fanconi anemia is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized
  by genomic instability, congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure,
  and increased susceptibility to malignancies. It results from biallelic mutations
  in genes encoding components of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway.
category: Genetic
parents:
- Bone Marrow Failure
- Congenital Disorder
prevalence:
- population: Global
  percentage: Rare
inheritance:
- name: Autosomal Recessive
- name: X-linked
pathophysiology:
- name: DNA Repair Deficiency
  description: Mutations in FA genes impair the body's ability to repair DNA damage,
    leading to increased sensitivity to crosslinking agents and propensity for chromosomal
    instability.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35596788
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: At least 22 genes are associated with Fanconi anemia, constituting the
      Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway. This pathway coordinates multiple processes
      and proteins to facilitate the repair of DNA adducts including interstrand
      crosslinks (ICLs)
  downstream:
  - target: Genomic Instability
  - target: Bone Marrow Failure
- name: Bone Marrow Failure
  description: Inability of the bone marrow to produce sufficient blood cells due
    to hematopoietic stem cell defects.
  downstream:
  - target: Pancytopenia

  description: Increased tendency for genomic alterations including chromosomal
    breaks, deletions, and rearrangements.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: ICLs can interfere with DNA transactions, including replication and
      transcription. If not properly removed and repaired, ICLs cause DNA breaks
      and lead to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer.
