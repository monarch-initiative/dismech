name: Keratoderma Hereditarium Mutilans
description: >
  Keratoderma hereditarium mutilans, also known as Vohwinkel syndrome, is a rare
  autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma
  with a distinctive honeycomb pattern, pseudoainhum (constricting bands around digits
  leading to autoamputation), and sensorineural hearing loss. The classic form is caused
  by mutations in the GJB2 gene encoding connexin 26. The ichthyotic variant (Camisa
  syndrome) is caused by mutations in the LOR gene encoding loricrin.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Gap Junction Dysfunction
    description: >
      Mutations in GJB2 disrupt connexin 26 function, impairing gap junction-mediated
      intercellular communication in the epidermis and cochlea. The D66H mutation occurs
      at a highly conserved residue in the first extracellular domain and may interfere
      with connexon assembly, docking, or gating properties. This leads to defective
      ion homeostasis and impaired cellular coordination during differentiation.
