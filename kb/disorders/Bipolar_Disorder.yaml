  description: >
    Imbalances in dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin neurotransmission
    contribute to mood episodes. Elevated dopamine in mania, reduced in
    depression.

    snippet: "Activation of the dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) has been shown to stimulate the inactivation of Akt by PP2A (Beaulieu et al., 2005; Beaulieu and Gainetdinov, 2011), therefore providing a mechanism through which GPCR activation can inhibit Akt in response to extracellular signals."
    explanation: Dopamine D2 receptor signaling regulates the Akt/GSK3 pathway, providing a molecular link between monoaminergic neurotransmission and mood regulation in bipolar disorder.
  - reference: PMID:22363263
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "This mechanism of D2R signaling appears to play important roles in the regulation of locomotor behavior and sensory motor gating by dopamine (Beaulieu et al., 2004; Emamian et al., 2004). It could also contribute to the therapeutic and/or adverse effects of psychoactive drugs like amphetamines and antpsychotics that act on dopamine neurotransmission"
    explanation: The D2 receptor-mediated regulation of GSK3 activity through beta-arrestin signaling is implicated in behavioral regulation relevant to bipolar disorder and the mechanism of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.

    snippet: "considering that schizophrenia is a multifactorial and highly polygenic disorder that shares many risk genes with other psychiatric illnesses including bipolar disorder, depression, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, it is to be expected that these diseases may also share some of these same mechanisms"
    explanation: Microglial activation and inflammatory processes are shared pathophysiological mechanisms across psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder, contributing to synaptic dysfunction.
