name: Malaria
category: Infectious Disease
description: Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease caused by Plasmodium
  species transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
  The five Plasmodium species known to infect humans are P. falciparum (most lethal),
  P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi. The disease is characterized
  by cyclic fevers, hemolytic anemia, and splenomegaly. Severe malaria, primarily
  caused by P. falciparum, can manifest as cerebral malaria, severe anemia, respiratory
  distress, and multi-organ failure. Pathogenesis involves erythrocyte invasion by
  parasites, cytoadherence of infected red blood cells to vascular endothelium,
  rosetting, and host inflammatory responses. Malaria remains a major global health
  burden, with most cases and deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.

infectious_agent:
- name: Plasmodium falciparum
  description: The most virulent malaria parasite, responsible for the majority of
    malaria deaths worldwide. Causes severe and complicated malaria including cerebral
    malaria.
- name: Plasmodium vivax
  description: The most geographically widespread malaria parasite, causing relapsing
    malaria due to dormant liver stages (hypnozoites). Previously considered benign
    but increasingly recognized as causing severe disease.
- name: Plasmodium ovale
  description: Similar to P. vivax, causes relapsing malaria due to hypnozoites.
    Found predominantly in West Africa.
- name: Plasmodium malariae
  description: Causes quartan malaria with 72-hour fever cycles. Can persist in the
    bloodstream for years at low levels. Associated with nephrotic syndrome.
- name: Plasmodium knowlesi
  description: A zoonotic malaria parasite primarily of macaque monkeys in Southeast
    Asia that can infect humans. Has a 24-hour replication cycle and can cause severe
    disease.
transmission:
- name: Mosquito Vector
  description: Transmitted by the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes during
    blood feeding. Over 40 Anopheles species can transmit malaria.
- name: Congenital Transmission
  description: Vertical transmission from infected mother to fetus through the placenta.
  notes: Risk is higher in non-immune mothers and with high parasitemia.
- name: Blood Transfusion
  description: Can be transmitted through transfusion of infected blood products.
  notes: Screening of blood donors in endemic areas is important.
prevalence:
- population: Global
  notes: An estimated 249 million malaria cases occurred worldwide in 2022, with
    608,000 deaths. About 95% of cases and 96% of deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa.
- population: Sub-Saharan Africa
  notes: Highest burden region, with children under 5 years accounting for about
    80% of malaria deaths.
- population: South and Southeast Asia
  notes: Second most affected region, with significant transmission in India and
    Indonesia.

  notes: Even with treatment, cerebral malaria has high mortality.
progression:
- phase: Liver Stage (Pre-erythrocytic)
  incubation_days: 7-30
  notes: After mosquito inoculation, sporozoites travel to the liver and develop
    into schizonts over 7-30 days depending on species. P. vivax and P. ovale can
    form dormant hypnozoites.
- phase: Blood Stage (Erythrocytic)
  notes: Merozoites released from liver infect red blood cells. Asexual replication
    occurs in 48-hour cycles (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale), 72-hour cycles
    (P. malariae), or 24-hour cycles (P. knowlesi). Clinical symptoms begin at this
    stage.
- phase: Sexual Stage (Gametocytogenesis)
  notes: Some parasites develop into male and female gametocytes that can be taken
    up by mosquitoes to continue the transmission cycle.

- name: Erythrocyte Invasion

  artemisinin-based therapies emerging in Southeast Asia, poses a significant
  threat to control efforts.
