  Malaria is a mosquito-borne protozoal infection caused by Plasmodium species,
  with major global burden from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
  Clinical disease is driven by blood-stage parasitemia, while severe falciparum
  syndromes involve microvascular sequestration and organ dysfunction, and vivax
  disease is complicated by relapse from dormant liver hypnozoites.
