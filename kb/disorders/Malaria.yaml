description: >-
  Malaria is a mosquito-borne protozoal infection caused by Plasmodium species,
  with major global burden from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
  Clinical disease is driven by blood-stage parasitemia, while severe falciparum
  syndromes involve microvascular sequestration and organ dysfunction, and vivax
  disease is complicated by relapse from dormant liver hypnozoites.

    snippet: "This is a 2-arm, individually-randomized, multi-centre, placebo-controlled superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of daily CTX plus monthly DP ('CTX-DP') versus daily CTX plus monthly placebo-DP (i.e. 'CTX-alone', control arm) to reduce malaria and the adverse effects of malaria in 898 (449 per arm) HIV-infected pregnant women on DTG-based cARTs."
    explanation: Registry record supports active clinical testing of preventive pharmacotherapy in a high-risk population.
