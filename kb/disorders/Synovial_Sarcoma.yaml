description: >-
  Synovial sarcoma is a translocation-driven soft tissue sarcoma characterized
  by the pathognomonic SS18-SSX fusion gene, present in virtually all cases.
  Despite its name, synovial sarcoma does not arise from synovial tissue and
  the cell of origin remains uncertain. It typically affects adolescents and
  young adults, with peak incidence in the third decade. Common sites include
  the extremities, particularly around large joints, but it can occur anywhere
  including head, neck, and trunk. The SS18-SSX fusion disrupts chromatin
  remodeling through interaction with the SWI/SNF complex, leading to epigenetic
  reprogramming that drives oncogenesis.

has_subtypes:
- name: Biphasic Synovial Sarcoma
  description: >-
    Contains both epithelial and spindle cell components with distinct glandular
    or epithelial differentiation. Accounts for approximately 20-30% of cases.
- name: Monophasic Synovial Sarcoma
  description: >-
    Composed predominantly of spindle cells without obvious epithelial component.
    The most common subtype, accounting for 50-60% of cases. Can be more difficult
    to diagnose histologically.
- name: Poorly Differentiated Synovial Sarcoma
  description: >-
    High-grade variant with round cell or epithelioid morphology. Associated
    with more aggressive behavior and worse prognosis.
pathophysiology:
- name: SS18-SSX Fusion Oncogene
  description: >-
    The t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation fuses the SS18 gene on chromosome 18 to
    one of three SSX genes (SSX1, SSX2, or rarely SSX4) on the X chromosome.
    The SS18-SSX fusion protein disrupts the BAF (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling
    complex, leading to aberrant transcriptional regulation and epigenetic
    reprogramming.

- name: BAF Complex Disruption
  description: >-
    The SS18-SSX fusion protein incorporates into the BAF chromatin remodeling
    complex, displacing wild-type SS18. This alters BAF complex targeting and
    function, particularly affecting polycomb-mediated gene repression. The
    fusion protein causes eviction of BAF47 (SMARCB1) from the complex at certain
    genomic loci.

  description: >-
    SS18-SSX-containing BAF complexes fail to properly oppose polycomb repressive
    complexes, leading to abnormal silencing of tumor suppressors and activation
    of oncogenic programs. Key target genes include BCL2 (antiapoptotic) and
    multiple receptor tyrosine kinases.

- name: SS18-SSX Fusion Detection
  notes: >-
    RT-PCR, FISH, or next-generation sequencing detection of the SS18-SSX fusion
    is diagnostic. The fusion type (SSX1 vs SSX2) may have prognostic significance,
    with SS18-SSX1 historically associated with worse outcomes.

    TLE1 is a highly sensitive marker for synovial sarcoma, positive in >95%
    of cases. Combined with morphology and SS18-SSX fusion status, it aids
    diagnosis.

  notes: >-
    The t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation is present in virtually all synovial
    sarcomas. SS18-SSX1 fusion occurs in approximately 65% and SS18-SSX2 in
    35% of cases. This fusion is both diagnostic and represents the primary
    oncogenic driver.
