pathophysiology:
- name: Upper Airway Collapse
  description: >

    to collapse, obstructing airflow. Anatomical factors (retrognathia,
    large tonsils, obesity) predispose to collapse.

    Intermittent hypoxia activates inflammatory pathways (NF-kB),
    elevating CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Contributes to metabolic
    dysfunction and atherosclerosis.
