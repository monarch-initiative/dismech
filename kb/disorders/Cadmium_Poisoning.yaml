name: Cadmium Poisoning
description: >-
  Cadmium poisoning is a toxic condition resulting from acute or chronic exposure
  to cadmium, a heavy metal encountered primarily through occupational sources
  (silver jewelry industry, zinc smelting, battery manufacturing), contaminated
  food and water, and tobacco smoke. Acute inhalation of cadmium fumes causes
  severe pneumonitis and acute lung injury. Chronic exposure leads to progressive
  renal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome), hypophosphataemic osteomalacia,
  osteoporosis, and peripheral neuropathy. The most severe form of chronic cadmium
  toxicity is itai-itai disease, endemic in cadmium-polluted regions of Japan,
  characterized by severe bone pain, fractures, and renal failure. Cadmium has a
  long biological half-life (10-30 years) and there is no effective antidote;
  management centers on exposure cessation, chelation therapy, and supportive care.

pathophysiology:
- name: Cadmium Absorption and Systemic Distribution
  description: >-
    Cadmium enters the body via inhalation of fumes/dust or gastrointestinal
    absorption from contaminated food and water. Inhaled cadmium has 25-50%
    bioavailability; oral absorption is lower (3-8%) but enhanced by iron
    deficiency via shared divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Once absorbed,
    cadmium distributes via the bloodstream bound to albumin and accumulates
    in liver, kidney, and bone with a biological half-life of 10-30 years.

    The liver is the primary site of initial cadmium detoxification.
    Hepatocytes synthesize metallothionein (MT), a cysteine-rich protein that
    binds cadmium with high affinity. The cadmium-metallothionein (Cd-MT)
    complex is slowly released into the bloodstream over time. While MT
    binding initially protects against free cadmium toxicity, the Cd-MT
    complex is filtered at the glomerulus and taken up by renal tubular cells,
    effectively transferring the cadmium burden to the kidney.

  description: >-
    Liver pathology shows hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis with gross

  description: >-
    Lead poisoning shares features with cadmium toxicity including renal tubular
    dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, and occupational exposure in metalworking

    stippling of erythrocytes, a lead line on gingiva, wrist/foot drop, and
    abdominal colic, which are not features of cadmium toxicity.

    Acquired Fanconi syndrome can result from multiple causes beyond cadmium,
    including medications (tenofovir, ifosfamide, cisplatin, valproic acid),

- name: Metal Fume Fever
  description: >-
    Metal fume fever, typically caused by zinc oxide fume inhalation, presents
    with flu-like symptoms (fever, myalgias, metallic taste) hours after
    welding or metalworking. It mimics early acute cadmium inhalation but
    is self-limiting within 24-48 hours and does not progress to ARDS.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Self-limiting course resolving within 24-48 hours
