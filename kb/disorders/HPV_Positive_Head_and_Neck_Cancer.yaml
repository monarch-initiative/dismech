name: HPV-Positive Head and Neck Cancer
description: >-
  HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a distinct clinical
  and molecular entity driven by high-risk human papillomavirus infection, primarily
  HPV-16. It predominantly affects the oropharynx (tonsils and base of tongue) and
  has increased dramatically in incidence over recent decades, particularly in younger
  patients. HPV-positive HNSCC has a markedly better prognosis than HPV-negative
  disease, with 5-year survival rates exceeding 80% in non-smoking patients. The
  oncogenic mechanisms parallel those of cervical cancer, with E6 and E7 oncoproteins
  inactivating p53 and pRB, respectively.

- name: Human Papillomavirus Type 16
  description: >-
    HPV-16 causes approximately 90% of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Unlike
    cervical cancer, HPV-18 plays a minor role in oropharyngeal carcinogenesis.
    Infection is believed to occur through orogenital contact.

pathophysiology:
- name: E6-Mediated p53 Degradation
  description: >-
    HPV E6 oncoprotein recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP to target p53 for
    proteasomal degradation, eliminating DNA damage checkpoints and allowing
    survival of cells with genomic instability. Unlike HPV-negative HNSCC,
    TP53 mutations are rare in HPV-positive tumors.

    description: p53 degradation abolishes G1/S and G2/M checkpoints
- name: E7-Mediated pRB Inactivation
  description: >-
    HPV E7 oncoprotein binds and degrades the retinoblastoma protein (pRB),
    releasing E2F transcription factors to drive S-phase entry. This causes
    compensatory overexpression of p16INK4a, which serves as a clinical
    biomarker for HPV-associated tumors.

  description: >-
    HPV genome integration into the host chromosome disrupts the E2 viral

    HPV may also drive carcinogenesis in some HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers.

    HPV-positive HNSCC evades immune surveillance through downregulation of

biochemical:
- name: p16 Immunohistochemistry
  notes: >-
    Strong, diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic p16 staining serves as a surrogate
    marker for transcriptionally active HPV infection. The p16 positivity is
    due to pRB inactivation by E7, which removes feedback inhibition of CDKN2A
    expression. p16 IHC is used clinically for staging and prognostication.
- name: HPV DNA/RNA Testing
  notes: >-
    Detection of high-risk HPV DNA or E6/E7 mRNA confirms HPV-driven
    carcinogenesis. RNA detection is more specific for transcriptionally
    active infection than DNA detection alone.
genetic:
- name: TP53
  association: Wild-type (rarely mutated)
  notes: >-
    Unlike HPV-negative HNSCC where TP53 mutations occur in greater than 80% of
    cases, HPV-positive tumors typically have wild-type TP53 because p53 function
    is eliminated through E6-mediated degradation.
- name: PIK3CA
  association: Somatic Mutations
  notes: >-
    PIK3CA mutations occur in approximately 20-30% of HPV-positive HNSCC,
    activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. This is the most commonly mutated
    oncogene in HPV-positive tumors.
- name: CDKN2A
  association: Rarely Inactivated
  notes: >-
    CDKN2A (p16) is typically wild-type and overexpressed in HPV-positive HNSCC
    due to E7-mediated pRB inactivation, in contrast to HPV-negative HNSCC where
    CDKN2A is frequently deleted or silenced.

    Concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy with intensity-modulated radiation
