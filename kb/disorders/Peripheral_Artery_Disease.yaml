    reserve. Decreased nitric oxide production and increased
    endothelin contribute.

    snippet: "It was observed that serum IL-6, IL-8, ICAM and VCAM levels in type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with PAD patients were increased significantly (85.93, 597.08, 94.80 and 80.66) as compared to T2DM patients (59.52, 231.34, 56.88 and 50.19) and healthy individuals (4.81, 16.93, 5.55 and 5.16)."
    explanation: Demonstrates marked elevation of endothelial activation markers (ICAM, VCAM) in PAD patients, indicating severe endothelial dysfunction.
  - reference: PMID:38182796
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "We have previously shown that VEGF165b, an alternatively spliced anti-angiogenic VEGF-A isoform, inhibits the VEGFR-STAT3 pathway in ischemic endothelial cells (ECs) to decrease their angiogenic capacity."
    explanation: Describes impaired angiogenic signaling in ischemic endothelial cells in PAD, contributing to endothelial dysfunction and inadequate collateral formation.
- name: Thrombosis
  description: >
    Plaque rupture or erosion triggers thrombosis, potentially
    causing acute limb ischemia. Platelet activation on disrupted
    plaque.

    snippet: "Continuous release of NETs in response to external stimuli leads to activation of surrounding platelets and monocytes/macrophages, resulting in damage to endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)."
    explanation: Demonstrates that neutrophil extracellular traps promote platelet activation and thrombosis in atherosclerotic vessels.
  - reference: PMID:37452714
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "NETs not only capture pathogens in innate immunity but also respond to sterile inflammatory stimuli in atherosclerosis, such as lipoproteins and inflammatory cytokines."
    explanation: Shows how NETs respond to atherosclerotic stimuli and contribute to prothrombotic conditions in PAD.
- name: Inflammation
  description: >
    Chronic inflammation drives plaque progression and instability.
    Elevated CRP and inflammatory markers predict cardiovascular events.

    snippet: "Peripheral artery disease (PAD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) are characterized by atherosclerosis and inflammation as their underlying mechanisms."
    explanation: Establishes inflammation as a core mechanism underlying PAD pathophysiology.
  - reference: PMID:37452714
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are network-like structures of chromatin filaments decorated by histones, granules, and cytoplasmic-derived proteins expelled by activated neutrophils under multiple pathogenic conditions."
    explanation: Describes neutrophil-driven inflammatory mechanisms involving NET formation in atherosclerosis.
  - reference: PMID:38401035
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Continuous release of NETs in response to external stimuli leads to activation of surrounding platelets and monocytes/macrophages, resulting in damage to endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)."
    explanation: Demonstrates how neutrophil-mediated inflammation causes vascular cell damage in atherosclerotic disease.
