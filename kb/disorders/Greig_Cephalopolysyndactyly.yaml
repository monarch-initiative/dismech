  Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is an autosomal dominant disorder
  caused by functional haploinsufficiency of GLI3, a zinc-finger transcription
  factor in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. GCPS is characterized by preaxial
  polydactyly, cutaneous syndactyly, macrocephaly, and hypertelorism. GLI3
  normally functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor in
  Hedgehog signaling; GCPS results from loss of total GLI3 protein through
  large deletions, translocations, or various intragenic mutations, in contrast
  to the allelic disorder Pallister-Hall syndrome which results from truncating
  mutations that produce a constitutive repressor.

  description: >
    Autosomal dominant with variable expressivity. Caused by functional
    haploinsufficiency of GLI3. Large deletions, translocations, and
    various intragenic mutations all cause GCPS, consistent with loss
    of function as the pathogenic mechanism.

pathophysiology:
- name: GLI3 Haploinsufficiency
  description: >
    GLI3 is a bifunctional zinc-finger transcription factor that mediates
    Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. In the absence of Hh signal, GLI3 is
    proteolytically processed into a truncated repressor form (GLI3R);
    when Hh is present, full-length GLI3 acts as a transcriptional
    activator (GLI3A). GCPS results from reduced total GLI3 protein
    through diverse mutation types (deletions, translocations, missense,
    frameshift), consistent with haploinsufficiency.

- name: Disrupted Anterior-Posterior Limb Patterning
  description: >
    Reduced GLI3 protein disrupts the GLI3A/GLI3R ratio, perturbing
    the anterior-posterior repressor gradient in the developing limb.
    This gradient normally restricts digit number and specifies digit
    identity. Disruption leads to preaxial polydactyly, syndactyly,
    and craniofacial features including macrocephaly and hypertelorism.
