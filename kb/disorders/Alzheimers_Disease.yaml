name: Alzheimer's Disease
description: >
  Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
  cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause
  of dementia, involving the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary
  tangles in the brain, leading to neuronal death and brain atrophy.

- name: Amyloid-Beta Plaque Formation
  description: >
    Extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides into senile plaques.
    Aβ is produced through sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)
    by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ are toxic to
    synapses and interfere with synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

    snippet: "physiologic generation of the neurotoxic Aβ peptide from sequential amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is the crucial step in the development of AD. APP is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the brain and metabolized in a rapid and highly complex fashion by a series of sequential proteases, including the intramembranous γ-secretase complex"
    explanation: Describes the sequential proteolytic processing of APP by secretases to generate Aβ peptides.
- name: Neurofibrillary Tangle Formation
  description: >
    Intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein forming neurofibrillary
    tangles (NFTs). Tau normally stabilizes microtubules, but abnormal hyperphosphorylation
    by various kinases reduces its affinity for microtubules, leading to accumulation
    of free tau that aggregates into paired helical filaments and NFTs. This causes
    mitochondrial dysfunction, impairs synaptic plasticity, and triggers neuroinflammation.

- name: Neuroinflammation
  description: >
    Chronic activation of microglia and astrocytes in response to Aβ plaques and
