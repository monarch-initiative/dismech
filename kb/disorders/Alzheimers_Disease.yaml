name: Alzheimer's Disease
description: >
  Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
  cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause
  of dementia, involving the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary
  tangles in the brain, leading to neuronal death and brain atrophy.

pathophysiology:
- name: Amyloid-Beta Plaque Formation
  description: >
    Extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides into senile plaques.
    Aβ is produced through sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)
    by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ are toxic to
    synapses and interfere with synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

- name: Neurofibrillary Tangle Formation
  description: >
    Intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein forming neurofibrillary
    tangles (NFTs). Tau normally stabilizes microtubules, but abnormal hyperphosphorylation
    by various kinases reduces its affinity for microtubules, leading to accumulation
    of free tau that aggregates into paired helical filaments and NFTs. This causes
    mitochondrial dysfunction, impairs synaptic plasticity, and triggers neuroinflammation.

- name: Synaptic Dysfunction
  description: >
    Oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau are toxic to synapses, interfering with molecular
    pathways required for synaptic plasticity and memory. This synaptic dysfunction
    precedes neuronal death and correlates with cognitive impairment severity.

  downstream:

- name: Neuroinflammation
  description: >
    Chronic activation of microglia and astrocytes in response to Aβ plaques and
    tau tangles. While initially attempting to clear pathological proteins, sustained
    inflammation produces pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species
    that damage neurons and exacerbate neurodegeneration.

  description: >
    Progressive loss of neurons, particularly in the hippocampus and cortex, leading
    to brain atrophy. Neuronal death results from accumulated damage from Aβ toxicity,
    tau pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.

genetic:
- name: APP
  association: Mutations cause early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease
  notes: Amyloid precursor protein gene; mutations increase production of aggregation-prone Aβ peptides, triggering pathological cascade. Accounts for 10-15% of autosomal dominant early-onset AD cases.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28002825
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Extremely rare variants in the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes, or duplications of the APP gene cause autosomal dominant forms, generally with complete penetrance by the age of 65 years.
    explanation: This confirms that APP mutations cause autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
- name: PSEN1
  association: Most common cause of early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease
  notes: Presenilin 1 gene; encodes component of γ-secretase complex. Mutations alter APP processing to increase Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Over 300 pathogenic mutations identified; accounts for 30-70% of autosomal dominant early-onset AD cases.

- name: APOE
  association: APOE ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease
  notes: Apolipoprotein E gene; APOE ε4 allele dramatically increases risk for late-onset AD. Heterozygous carriers have OR of 4, homozygous carriers have OR of 11-14. The ε4 allele affects Aβ clearance, aggregation, and toxicity.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28002825

    snippet: Among them, the APOE ε4 allele is a rare example of a common allele with a large effect size, the ORs ranging from 4 to 11-14 for heterozygous and homozygous carriers, respectively.
