description: >
  Dieulafoy lesion is a rare vascular anomaly characterized by a caliber-persistent submucosal
  artery that erodes the overlying mucosa without forming a true ulcer, leading to sudden,
  potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding anywhere along the GI tract.

pathophysiology:
- name: Caliber-Persistent Submucosal Artery
  description: >
    An abnormally large, tortuous submucosal artery fails to taper and can erode through
    intact mucosa, predisposing to arterial bleeding without prior ulceration.
