  Auto-brewery syndrome (ABS), also known as gut fermentation syndrome or endogenous
  ethanol fermentation, is a rare condition where intoxicating quantities of ethanol
  are produced through endogenous fermentation of carbohydrates within the gastrointestinal
  tract by fungi or bacteria, leading to symptoms of alcohol intoxication without
  alcohol consumption.

pathophysiology:
- name: Fungal Gut Fermentation
  description: >
    Overgrowth of fermenting fungi, particularly Candida and Saccharomyces species,
    in the gastrointestinal tract converts dietary carbohydrates into ethanol through
    alcoholic fermentation. Glucose is metabolized through glycolysis to pyruvate,
    which is then converted to acetaldehyde by pyruvate decarboxylase and subsequently
    reduced to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase.

    snippet: "The gut fermentation syndrome (GFS), also known as the endogenous alcohol fermentation syndrome or auto brewery syndrome, is a rare and underdiagnosed medical condition where consumed carbohydrates are converted to alcohol by the microbiota in the gastrointestinal or urinary tract."
    explanation: Systematic review confirms that carbohydrates are fermented to alcohol by microbiota in the GI tract.

    snippet: "The species that caused the GFS included Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, C. glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C. intermedia, C. parapsilosis, and C. kefyr."
    explanation: Identifies the spectrum of fungal organisms responsible for gut fermentation syndrome.
- name: Bacterial Fermentation by Klebsiella
  description: >
    High-alcohol-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and related species can generate
    endogenous ethanol through the 2,3-butanediol fermentation pathway. These bacteria
    possess multiple copies of alcohol dehydrogenase genes enabling excessive ethanol
    production even under aerobic conditions.

- name: Impaired Hepatic Ethanol Clearance
  description: >
    The liver normally clears endogenous ethanol through first-pass metabolism via
    alcohol dehydrogenase. When ethanol production exceeds hepatic clearance capacity
    or hepatic function is compromised, ethanol enters systemic circulation causing
    intoxication symptoms.
