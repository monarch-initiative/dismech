  description: >
    Elevated serum uric acid from increased purine metabolism or decreased
    renal excretion leads to supersaturation and crystal formation.

- name: Crystal Deposition
  description: >
    Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals deposit in joints and soft tissues
    when serum urate exceeds saturation point (~6.8 mg/dL). Crystals
    trigger inflammatory response.

- name: Inflammasome Activation
  description: >
    MSU crystals are phagocytosed by macrophages, activating NLRP3
    inflammasome and triggering IL-1beta release, driving acute
    inflammatory flare.

    snippet: "Gout represents an autoinflammatory disorder instigated by monosodium urate crystals. Its primary manifestation involves the recruitment of diverse immune cell populations, including neutrophils and macrophages. Macrophages assume a pivotal role in the initiation of acute gouty inflammation and subsequent inflammatory cascades."

  - reference: PMID:39426967
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "At 48 weeks ULT, serum urate normalized in all gout patients, and flares declined in association with significantly altered proteins (p < 0.05) in clustering and proteome networks in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells."
    explanation: Shows that effective urate-lowering therapy modulates immune cell proteomes, including those relevant to inflammasome activation, correlating with reduced flare burden.
- name: Neutrophil Recruitment

    amplifying inflammation and causing the intense pain and swelling
    of acute gout attacks.

    MSU crystals activate the complement system, particularly C5, contributing
    to neutrophil recruitment and amplifying the inflammatory response.
    Effective urate-lowering therapy modulates complement and inflammatory
    protein networks.

    snippet: "Last, febuxostat treatment decreased complement activation biologic process proteins in cultured BMDMs."
    explanation: Provides mechanistic evidence that xanthine oxidase inhibitors directly modulate complement activation in macrophages beyond their urate-lowering effects.
- name: Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation
  description: >
    Neutrophils form extracellular traps (NETs) in response to MSU crystals.
    NETs initially amplify inflammation but aggregated NETs (aggNETs) promote
    resolution by encapsulating crystals, degrading cytokines, and blocking
    further neutrophil recruitment. NETs also contribute to tophi formation.

  - preferred_term: Neutrophil
    term:
      id: CL:0000775

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38910565
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are formed by neutrophils in response to pathogen attack. During gout, NETs induced by MSU crystals exacerbate inflammation, and aggregated NETs (aggNETs) promote the resolution of gout-associated inflammation by encapsulating MSU crystals, degrading cytokines and chemokines, and blocking the recruitment and activation of neutrophils."
    explanation: Describes the dual role of NETs in gout - initially amplifying inflammation but then promoting resolution through aggregation and sequestration mechanisms.

    snippet: "With disease progression, NETs participate in the formation of tophi."
    explanation: Establishes the role of NETs in chronic gout pathology, specifically in the formation of tophi (urate crystal deposits).
