name: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2
description: >-
  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an autosomal dominant hereditary
  cancer syndrome caused by germline activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene.
  It is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and
  depending on the subtype, primary hyperparathyroidism or mucosal neuromas with
  marfanoid habitus. MEN2 exemplifies oncogenic gain-of-function mutations in receptor
  tyrosine kinases and demonstrates genotype-phenotype correlations that guide the
  timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and surveillance protocols.

has_subtypes:
- name: MEN2A
  description: >-
    The most common subtype (95% of MEN2), characterized by medullary thyroid
    carcinoma (95%), pheochromocytoma (50%), and primary hyperparathyroidism (20-30%).
    Most commonly caused by mutations at codon 634 (Cys634Arg). Penetrance for MTC
    approaches 100% but varies with specific mutation.
- name: MEN2B
  description: >-
    The most aggressive subtype (5% of MEN2), characterized by earlier and more
    aggressive MTC, pheochromocytoma (50%), mucosal neuromas of lips and tongue,
    intestinal ganglioneuromatosis, and marfanoid habitus. Does not include
    hyperparathyroidism. Caused by M918T mutation in 95% of cases.
- name: Familial Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (FMTC)
  description: >-
    MTC without pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism in four or more family
    members. Now considered a variant of MEN2A with lower penetrance for
    pheochromocytoma rather than a separate entity. Associated with mutations
    at codons 609, 611, 618, 620, and 791.
pathophysiology:
- name: RET Oncogene Activation
  description: >-
    Germline activating mutations in RET cause ligand-independent receptor
    dimerization and constitutive tyrosine kinase activation. Unlike tumor
    suppressor syndromes, only one mutant allele is required (no second hit).
    This represents a gain-of-function oncogene mechanism.

    proliferation, survival, and transformation of neuroendocrine cell populations.

  description: >-
    C-cell hyperplasia progresses to medullary thyroid carcinoma. The age of MTC
    onset correlates with mutation location and aggressiveness. MEN2B mutations
    (M918T) cause earliest onset, often in infancy, while some FMTC mutations
    may not cause MTC until adulthood.
phenotypes:

  name: Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
  frequency: OBLIGATE
  diagnostic: true
  description: >-
    MTC occurs in virtually all MEN2 patients and is the primary cause of morbidity
    and mortality. Develops from thyroid C-cells that produce calcitonin. Age of
    onset depends on RET mutation: MEN2B patients may develop MTC in infancy while
    some FMTC mutations cause later onset. Prophylactic thyroidectomy timing is
    based on mutation risk category.

    snippet: >-
      MEN2A accounts for 90-95% of childhood MTC cases and is most commonly due to
      mutations in codon 634 of RET. MEN2B is associated with the most aggressive
      clinical presentation of MTC and is almost always due to the Met918Thr mutation
      of RET.
    explanation: >-
      Review confirms MTC is the hallmark of MEN2 with genotype-phenotype correlations
      determining clinical presentation and aggressiveness.
- category: Neoplastic
  name: Pheochromocytoma
  frequency: FREQUENT
  description: >-
    Pheochromocytomas occur in approximately 50% of MEN2A and MEN2B patients.
    Often bilateral (50-80%) and may be diagnosed before, concurrent with, or
    after MTC. Screening with plasma metanephrines is essential before any surgery.
    Generally benign but can cause hypertensive crises if undiagnosed.

    Calcitonin is produced by thyroid C-cells and elevated in MTC. Used for

    testing may detect early C-cell hyperplasia or microcarcinoma.
- name: Plasma Metanephrines
  notes: >-
    Fractionated plasma metanephrines are used to screen for pheochromocytoma.
    Must be performed before any surgery (especially thyroidectomy) to avoid
    intraoperative hypertensive crisis from undiagnosed pheochromocytoma.
- name: RET Genetic Testing
  notes: >-
    Molecular testing of RET identifies pathogenic variants and guides management.
    ATA risk categories based on specific mutations determine timing of prophylactic
    thyroidectomy: highest risk (M918T) within first year of life; high risk
    (codons 634, A883F) before age 5; moderate risk (others) individualized.
genetic:
- name: RET
  association: Germline Activating Mutations
  inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
  notes: >-
    RET (10q11.21) encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for neural crest
    development. Germline activating mutations cause ligand-independent dimerization
    and kinase activation. MEN2A is most commonly caused by cysteine mutations
    in extracellular domain (codons 609, 611, 618, 620, 634). MEN2B is caused by
    M918T in 95% of cases. De novo mutations account for 50% of MEN2B and 5% of
    MEN2A. Penetrance for MTC approaches 100% but age of onset varies with mutation.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:11786689
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      The gene causing all three MEN2 variants is located on chromosome 10cen-10q11.2,
      and is the c-ret proto-oncogene which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor with
      cadherin-like and cysteine-rich extracellular domains, and a tyrosine kinase
      intracellular domain. Specific mutations of c-ret have been identified for each
      of the three MEN2 variants.
    explanation: >-
      Review confirms RET proto-oncogene as the gene responsible for all MEN2 variants
      with specific mutations identified for each clinical variant.
treatments:
- name: Prophylactic Thyroidectomy
  description: >-
    Total thyroidectomy prevents MTC development. Timing is based on ATA risk
    stratification: highest risk (M918T) in first year of life; high risk (codon
    634, A883F) before age 5; moderate risk individualized based on calcitonin
    levels and family history. Central lymph node dissection may be included.

      Surgery is the primary treatment and only chance of cure, although the advent
      of targeted therapies seems to be improving progression-free survival in advanced
      cases. Since the discovery of the role of RET in MEN2A, considerable advances
      in the management of this syndrome have occurred, and most of the children with
      MEN2A who have undergone early thyroidectomy will now lead full, productive lives.
    explanation: >-
      Review confirms prophylactic thyroidectomy as curative treatment for MEN2
      with excellent outcomes when performed early based on genotype.
- name: RET Kinase Inhibitors
  description: >-
    Selective RET inhibitors (selpercatinib, pralsetinib) provide targeted therapy
    for advanced/metastatic MTC. These agents have revolutionized treatment of
    RET-driven cancers with high response rates and durable responses. Used when
    surgery is not curative.
