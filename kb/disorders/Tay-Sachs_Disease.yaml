    label: Tay-Sachs disease
has_subtypes:
- name: Infantile Tay-Sachs
  description: Classic form with onset at 3-6 months, rapidly progressive, fatal by age 4-5.
- name: Juvenile Tay-Sachs
  description: Onset in childhood, slower progression, death in adolescence.

pathophysiology:
- name: Hexosaminidase A Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in the HEXA gene cause deficient beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme.
    This enzyme is essential for degrading GM2 ganglioside in lysosomes.
    Without it, GM2 accumulates in neurons causing progressive neurodegeneration.

- name: Neuronal GM2 Accumulation
  description: >
    Progressive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neuronal lysosomes causes
