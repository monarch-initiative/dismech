disease_term:
  preferred_term: Tay-Sachs disease
  term:
    id: MONDO:0010100
    label: Tay-Sachs disease
has_subtypes:
- name: Infantile Tay-Sachs
  description: Classic form with onset at 3-6 months, rapidly progressive, fatal by age 4-5.
- name: Juvenile Tay-Sachs
  description: Onset in childhood, slower progression, death in adolescence.
- name: Late-Onset Tay-Sachs
  description: Adult onset, variable progression, compatible with longer survival.
pathophysiology:
- name: Hexosaminidase A Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in the HEXA gene cause deficient beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme.
    This enzyme is essential for degrading GM2 ganglioside in lysosomes.
    Without it, GM2 accumulates in neurons causing progressive neurodegeneration.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:19820796
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of sphingolipid metabolism, caused by enzyme hexosaminidase A deficiency that leads to an accumulation of GM2 in neurocytes which results in progressive loss of neurological function."
    explanation: Case report confirms hexosaminidase A deficiency causes GM2 accumulation and neurodegeneration.
- name: Neuronal GM2 Accumulation
  description: >
    Progressive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neuronal lysosomes causes
    cell swelling, dysfunction, and death. Particularly affects neurons in
    the central nervous system leading to neurodegeneration.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "All of them had a developmental disorder as a chief complaint. 38%of patients had a history of developmental delay or regression"
    explanation: Case series confirms developmental regression as a key presenting feature in GM2 gangliosidosis patients.

    snippet: "The accumulation of lipid in retinal ganglion cells that leads to a chalk-white appearance of the fundus called 'cherry red spot' is the hallmark of Tay-Sachs disease."
    explanation: Case report describes cherry-red spot as the hallmark ophthalmologic finding in Tay-Sachs disease.
