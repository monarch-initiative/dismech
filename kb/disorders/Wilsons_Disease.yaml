    label: Wilson disease
pathophysiology:
- name: Copper Accumulation
  description: >
    ATP7B mutations impair copper excretion into bile and incorporation into
    ceruloplasmin. Copper accumulates in liver, brain, and other organs.
    Free copper causes oxidative damage and cellular toxicity.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The Wilson disease protein is a putative copper-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B, whose malfunction results in the toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, causing the hepatic and/or neurological symptoms accompanying this disease."
    explanation: Molecular study confirms ATP7B malfunction causes toxic copper accumulation in liver and brain.
- name: Hepatocyte Injury
  description: >
    Copper accumulation in hepatocytes causes oxidative stress, mitochondrial
    dysfunction, and cell death. Progressive liver damage leads to fibrosis
    and cirrhosis.
