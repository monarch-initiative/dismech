pathophysiology:
- name: Copper Accumulation
  description: >
    ATP7B mutations impair copper excretion into bile and incorporation into
    ceruloplasmin. Copper accumulates in liver, brain, and other organs.
    Free copper causes oxidative damage and cellular toxicity. ATP7B normally
    resides in the trans-Golgi network where it loads copper into
    apoceruloplasmin and traffics to the canalicular membrane for biliary
    copper excretion when intracellular copper is elevated.
