pathophysiology:
- name: Copper Accumulation
  description: >
    ATP7B mutations impair copper excretion into bile and incorporation into
    ceruloplasmin. Copper accumulates in many organs, especially liver and
    brain. Free copper is toxic and promotes oxidative damage and cellular
    toxicity. ATP7B normally resides in the trans-Golgi network where it loads
    copper into apoceruloplasmin and traffics to the bile canalicular membrane
    for biliary copper excretion when intracellular copper is elevated.
