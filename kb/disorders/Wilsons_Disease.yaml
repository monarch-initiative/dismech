  term:
    id: MONDO:0010200
    label: Wilson disease
pathophysiology:
- name: Copper Accumulation
  description: >
    ATP7B mutations impair copper excretion into bile and incorporation into
    ceruloplasmin. Copper accumulates in liver, brain, and other organs.
    Free copper causes oxidative damage and cellular toxicity.

      label: copper ion transport
- name: Hepatocyte Injury
  description: >
    Copper accumulation in hepatocytes causes oxidative stress, mitochondrial
    dysfunction, and cell death. Progressive liver damage leads to fibrosis
    and cirrhosis.

- name: Neurodegeneration
  description: >
    Copper deposition in basal ganglia causes neuronal damage. Astrocyte
    swelling and neuroinflammation contribute to movement disorders and
    psychiatric symptoms.
