description: >
  Galactosemia is an inborn error of galactose metabolism caused by deficiency
  of one of three enzymes in the Leloir pathway: galactose-1-phosphate
  uridyltransferase (GALT, classic galactosemia), galactokinase (GALK), or
  UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (GALE). Classic galactosemia (GALT deficiency) is
  the most severe form, presenting in neonates with feeding difficulties,
  failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and increased susceptibility to
  E. coli sepsis. Early dietary restriction of galactose prevents acute
  toxicity but long-term complications including cognitive impairment,
  speech disorders, and premature ovarian insufficiency may still occur.

    term:

      label: classic galactosemia
  description: >
    Most common and severe form caused by GALT deficiency. Presents in
    neonates with life-threatening illness if untreated.
- name: Galactokinase Deficiency
  description: >
    Milder form caused by GALK1 deficiency. Primary manifestation is
    cataracts without the systemic toxicity of classic galactosemia.
- name: Epimerase Deficiency
  description: >
    Caused by GALE deficiency. Phenotype ranges from benign peripheral
    form to severe generalized form resembling classic galactosemia.
pathophysiology:
- name: Galactose-1-phosphate accumulation
  description: >
    In classic galactosemia, GALT deficiency prevents conversion of
    galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) to UDP-galactose. Accumulated Gal-1-P
    is directly toxic to liver, brain, kidneys, and ovaries through
    multiple mechanisms including inhibition of phosphoglucomutase and
    depletion of inorganic phosphate.
- name: UDP-galactose deficiency
  description: >
    Reduced UDP-galactose impairs galactosylation of glycoproteins and
    glycolipids. Abnormal glycosylation affects brain development,
    folliculogenesis, and multiple cellular processes. This deficiency
    persists despite dietary treatment, contributing to long-term
    complications.
- name: Galactitol toxicity
  description: >
    Galactose is reduced to galactitol by aldose reductase. Galactitol
    accumulates in the lens causing osmotic stress and cataracts. In
    galactokinase deficiency, this is the primary pathogenic mechanism.
phenotypes:
- name: Neonatal jaundice
  frequency: FREQUENT
  description: >
    Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia appearing in the first week of life
    due to hepatocellular dysfunction.
- name: Hepatomegaly
  frequency: FREQUENT
  description: >
    Enlarged liver from hepatocellular damage and fatty infiltration.
- name: Failure to thrive
  frequency: FREQUENT
  description: >
    Poor weight gain and growth failure in affected neonates.
- name: Cataracts
  frequency: FREQUENT
  description: >
    Oil-droplet cataracts from galactitol accumulation in the lens.
    May be present at birth or develop in first weeks of life.
- name: E. coli sepsis
  frequency: OCCASIONAL
  description: >
    Increased susceptibility to gram-negative sepsis, particularly
    E. coli, in the neonatal period. Mechanism involves impaired
    neutrophil function and complement activation.
- name: Intellectual disability
  frequency: OCCASIONAL
  description: >
    Cognitive impairment may occur despite early dietary treatment,
    likely due to endogenous galactose production and UDP-galactose
    deficiency affecting brain development.
- name: Speech disorders
  frequency: FREQUENT
  description: >
    Verbal dyspraxia and speech delays are common long-term complications
    even with early treatment.
- name: Premature ovarian insufficiency
  frequency: FREQUENT
  description: >
    Over 80% of females with classic galactosemia develop hypergonadotropic
    hypogonadism with primary or secondary amenorrhea.
- name: Tremor
  frequency: OCCASIONAL
  description: >
    Movement disorders including tremor and ataxia may develop as
    long-term neurological complications.
genetic:
- name: GALT variants (Classic galactosemia)
  inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal recessive
  features: >
    Classic galactosemia is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in
    GALT (9p13.3). The most common variants include Q188R (most common
    in European populations), K285N, S135L, and L195P. The Duarte variant
    (N314D) causes partial enzyme deficiency.
- name: GALK1 variants (Galactokinase deficiency)
  inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal recessive
  features: >
    Caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in GALK1 (17q25.1).

treatments:
- name: Galactose-restricted diet
  description: >
    Lifelong dietary restriction of galactose is the cornerstone of
    treatment. Lactose-containing foods (milk, dairy) are eliminated
    and replaced with soy-based or elemental formulas in infancy.
- name: Calcium and vitamin D supplementation
  description: >
    Supplementation is necessary due to dairy restriction to prevent
    osteoporosis.
