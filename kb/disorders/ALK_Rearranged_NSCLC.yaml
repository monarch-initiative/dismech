description: >-
  ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a molecularly-defined lung
  cancer subtype driven by chromosomal rearrangements involving the anaplastic
  lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. ALK fusions occur in approximately 3-7% of NSCLC,
  most commonly EML4-ALK resulting from an inversion on chromosome 2. ALK-positive
  NSCLC occurs predominantly in younger patients with minimal or no smoking history.
  Multiple generations of highly effective ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have
  transformed this disease from rapidly fatal to chronic manageable condition.

has_subtypes:
- name: EML4-ALK NSCLC
  description: >-
    EML4-ALK fusion is the most common ALK rearrangement in NSCLC (~90%),
    resulting from an inversion on chromosome 2p. Multiple EML4-ALK variants
    exist (V1, V2, V3a/b) differing in the EML4 breakpoint. V3 may have
    different resistance patterns.
- name: Non-EML4 ALK Fusion NSCLC
  description: >-
    Rare ALK fusions with partners other than EML4, including KIF5B-ALK,
    TFG-ALK, and KLC1-ALK. Generally respond similarly to ALK TKIs.
pathophysiology:
- name: ALK Gene Rearrangement
  description: >-
    ALK rearrangements result from chromosomal inversions or translocations
    that fuse the ALK kinase domain to an N-terminal partner gene (usually
    EML4). The partner provides a dimerization domain, causing constitutive
    ALK kinase activation independent of ligand.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: An early result of this search was the discovery of NSCLC driven by
      activating rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene.
    explanation: This abstract states that ALK rearrangements drive a subset of
      NSCLC, supporting the ALK gene rearrangement mechanism.

    description: Fusion protein is constitutively active
- name: Constitutive ALK Signaling
  description: >-
    The EML4-ALK fusion protein is constitutively dimerized and auto-phosphorylated,
    activating downstream signaling including RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and JAK-STAT3
    pathways. These pathways promote cell proliferation, survival, and migration.

    description: Tumor survival dependent on ALK activity
- name: Oncogene Addiction
  description: >-
    ALK-rearranged tumors exhibit oncogene addiction, becoming dependent on
    continued ALK signaling for survival. ALK inhibition leads to dramatic
    tumor responses, often within days to weeks of starting therapy.

- name: ALK TKI Resistance
  description: >-
    Resistance to ALK TKIs develops through ALK-dependent mechanisms (secondary
    mutations like G1202R, compound mutations) or ALK-independent bypass
    pathways (MET, EGFR, KRAS). Later-generation TKIs (lorlatinib) overcome
    most single ALK mutations.

  description: >-
    ALK-rearranged NSCLC is almost exclusively adenocarcinoma histology, often
    with signet ring or cribriform patterns. Typically presents in younger
    patients.

  name: Young Age at Diagnosis
  frequency: VERY_FREQUENT
  description: >-
    ALK-positive patients are typically younger than other NSCLC patients
    (median age ~50s vs 70s). This reflects the different carcinogenic
    pathway (driver mutation vs smoking-related).

biochemical:
- name: ALK Testing
  notes: >-
    ALK testing is required for all advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Methods include
    FISH (FDA-approved companion diagnostic), immunohistochemistry (screening),
    and next-generation sequencing (identifies fusion partner and variant).
    ALK is mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations.
genetic:
- name: ALK
  association: Somatic Rearrangement
  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    ALK (2p23.2) encodes anaplastic lymphoma kinase, a receptor tyrosine kinase.
    Gene rearrangements occur somatically and are not inherited. EML4-ALK is
    the most common fusion (~90%), resulting from inv(2)(p21;p23). Resistance
    mutations include L1196M (gatekeeper), G1202R (solvent front), and
    compound mutations.
- name: EML4
  association: Fusion Partner
  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    EML4 (2p21) encodes echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4.
    Provides the N-terminus and dimerization domain in EML4-ALK fusions.
    Multiple fusion variants exist based on EML4 breakpoint (V1-V8).
