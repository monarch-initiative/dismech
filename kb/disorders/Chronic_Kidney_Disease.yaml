  description: >
    Progressive loss of functional nephrons from any cause leads to compensatory
    hyperfiltration in remaining nephrons, which paradoxically accelerates
    further damage and fibrosis.

    snippet: "Patients diagnosed with AKI often undergo diverse clinical trajectories, such as early or late recovery, relapses, and even a potential transition from AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD)."
    explanation: This describes how acute injury leads to progressive nephron loss and CKD transition, supporting the concept that initial damage triggers compensatory mechanisms that accelerate further injury.

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "This article provides a thorough overview of the biomarkers, pathophysiology, and molecular pathways involved in the transition from acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute kidney disease (AKD) to chronic kidney disease (CKD)."
    explanation: The transition from AKI to CKD involves progressive nephron loss with maladaptive repair mechanisms that drive ongoing damage and fibrosis.
- name: Glomerulosclerosis
  description: >
    Scarring and hardening of glomeruli impairs filtration function.
    Driven by hemodynamic stress, inflammation, and metabolic factors.

    snippet: "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a slowly progressive condition characterized by decreased kidney function, tubular injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation."
    explanation: This describes the inflammatory and oxidative stress components that drive glomerulosclerosis alongside hemodynamic factors.
  - reference: PMID:37857763
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are derivatives of oxygen molecules that are generated during aerobic metabolism and are involved in a variety of cellular functions that are governed by redox conditions."
    explanation: ROS generation contributes to oxidative stress and metabolic factors that drive glomerular scarring and impaired filtration.
- name: Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis
  description: >
    Fibrotic replacement of tubular structures by collagen-producing
    myofibroblasts. The final common pathway of CKD progression.

      label: myofibroblast cell
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38610646
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a central mediator in promoting transdifferentiation of polarized renal tubular epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, resulting in irreversible kidney injury."
    explanation: This supports the mechanism of fibrotic replacement where TGF-β drives transdifferentiation of tubular epithelial cells, leading to fibrosis and irreversible injury.
  - reference: PMID:38339031
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Key signaling pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β/SMAD, and Hippo/YAP/TAZ, promote fibrosis and impact renal function."
    explanation: This confirms that TGF-β/SMAD and other pathways drive fibrotic processes that characterize the final common pathway of CKD progression.
- name: RAAS Activation
  description: >
    Inappropriately activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system promotes
    glomerular hypertension, fibrosis, and sodium retention.

  - preferred_term: Kidney
    term:

      label: kidney
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: RAAS Signaling
    term:
      id: GO:0002018
      label: renin-angiotensin regulation of aldosterone production
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38339031
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) triggers a cascade leading to renal fibrosis, with aldosterone exacerbating the oxidative stress and cellular changes that promote fibrosis."
    explanation: This directly supports the mechanism by which RAAS activation promotes fibrosis through aldosterone-mediated oxidative stress and cellular injury in CKD.
  - reference: PMID:38610646
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Current therapies such as renin-angiotensin blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors aim to delay progression."
    explanation: The therapeutic efficacy of RAAS blockers confirms that RAAS activation is a key driver of CKD progression, supporting its role in promoting hypertension and fibrosis.
