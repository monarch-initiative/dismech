description: 'Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of creatine biosynthesis
  caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in GAMT (19p13.3). GAMT catalyzes the final step of endogenous creatine synthesis
  by methylating guanidinoacetate (GAA) to creatine using S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. Loss of GAMT activity
  produces systemic and cerebral creatine depletion together with neurotoxic accumulation of guanidinoacetate in biofluids
  and brain. Clinical manifestations are dominated by early-onset neurodevelopmental impairment with intellectual disability,
  severe speech delay, epilepsy, behavioral abnormalities, and movement disorders. Presymptomatic treatment with creatine
  supplementation, ornithine, and dietary arginine restriction substantially improves outcomes, motivating addition to the
  US Recommended Uniform Screening Panel in January 2023. Birth prevalence is estimated at 0.5 to 2 per million live births.

prevalence:
- notes: Birth prevalence is estimated between 0.5 and 2 per million live births. In newborn screening programs, approximately
    1 per 100,000 newborns screen positive. Programmatic detection rates include 1 case in 1.4 million screened in Australia,
    1 case per 321,305 screened in Utah, and 1 case per 759,246 screened in New York.
progression:
- notes: Newborns may appear asymptomatic at birth due to in utero placental creatine transfer. Symptoms first become noticeable
    at a mean of approximately 14 months (range 3-24 months). Without newborn screening, mean age at diagnosis is approximately
    8.5 years (range 9 months to 25 years). Once significant neurologic impairment develops, treatment benefit is limited,
    underscoring the critical window for early intervention. The four patients treated before 9 months of age in a landmark
    cohort had normal or near-normal developmental outcomes.
pathophysiology:
- name: Deficient creatine biosynthesis
  description: 'Loss of GAMT enzymatic activity blocks the conversion of guanidinoacetate to creatine, the final step of endogenous
    creatine biosynthesis. This results in systemic and cerebral creatine depletion, impairing the creatine/phosphocreatine
    energy shuttle that is critical for rapid ATP regeneration in high-energy-demand tissues, particularly the brain.

- name: Sodium benzoate therapy
  description: 'Sodium benzoate is used in some treatment protocols to reduce glycine availability, a precursor for guanidinoacetate
    synthesis. Dosing is approximately 100 mg/kg/day. This reduces the substrate pool available for AGAT, contributing to
    GAA lowering.

      with the biochemical findings, treated mice gained weight to nearly match their wild-type littermates, while behavioral
      studies demonstrated resolution of abnormalities
    explanation: Demonstrates improved cerebral/myocardial creatine and resolved behavioral phenotype with gene therapy.
notes: 'GAMT deficiency is one of three cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS), alongside AGAT deficiency (GATM mutations)
  and creatine transporter deficiency (SLC6A8 mutations). GAMT deficiency is distinguished by elevated guanidinoacetate (rather
  than low GAA in AGAT deficiency or elevated urine creatine-to-creatinine ratio in SLC6A8 deficiency). Treatment is most
  effective when initiated presymptomatically, as demonstrated by normal/near-normal outcomes in the four patients treated
  before 9 months in the landmark 48-patient cohort. This underscores the importance of newborn screening, which was added
  to the US RUSP in January 2023. Long-term monitoring with 1H-MRS shows that brain creatine may increase with treatment but
  typically does not reach age-matched control ranges, motivating ongoing development of curative gene therapy approaches.
