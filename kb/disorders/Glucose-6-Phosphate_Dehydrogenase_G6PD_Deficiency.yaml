    explanation: This reference mentions G6PD deficiency as a significant risk factor for hyperbilirubinemia, which supports the need for early screening and monitoring.
review_notes: G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by defective red blood cell metabolism. The G6PD enzyme catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, producing NADPH essential for maintaining glutathione in the reduced state and protecting erythrocytes from oxidative damage. In deficient individuals, decreased NADPH leads to impaired glutathione homeostasis, making RBCs vulnerable to oxidant-induced hemoglobin denaturation (Heinz bodies), membrane lipid peroxidation, and hemolysis. The classic presentation is episodic hemolytic anemia triggered by oxidative stressors including infections, certain medications (primaquine, sulfonamides, dapsone), and fava beans. Severity ranges from asymptomatic carriers to life-threatening hemolytic crises. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is an important manifestation requiring prompt phototherapy to prevent kernicterus. Management focuses on trigger avoidance and supportive care during acute episodes.
