  - reference: PMID:28451788
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. The presence of autoantibodies in the sera of RA patients has provided many clues to the underlying disease pathophysiology. Based on the presence of several autoantibodies like rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)... RA can be subdivided into seropositive and seronegative disease.
    explanation: The literature indicates that RA can be subdivided into seropositive and seronegative types based on the presence of RF and/or ACPAs in the sera of the patients, which supports the given statement.
- name: Seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis
  description: Absence of both RF and anti-CCP antibodies, but with typical clinical features of RA.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:33329548
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Traditionally, RA is divided into seropositive (SP) and seronegative (SN) disease forms, the latter consisting of an array of unrelated diseases with joint involvement.
    explanation: This study discusses SN-RA as a form characterized by the absence of anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF), supporting the statement.
  - reference: PMID:3266362
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: We became increasingly concerned with the problem of defining properly patients with seronegative RA. Both the statement of seronegativity with regard to rheumatoid factors (RF), the diagnosis of RA, and particularly the exclusion of cases of seronegative arthritis other than RA were difficult.
    explanation: This study acknowledges the existence of seronegative RA defined by the absence of RF.
  - reference: PMID:32678001
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is classified as seropositive or seronegative, depending on the presence/absence of rheumatoid factor (RF), primarily IgM RF, and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), commonly detected using anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) assays.
    explanation: This supports the seronegative classification based on the absence of RF and anti-CCP antibodies but points out the complexity and variability within seronegative RA.
  - reference: PMID:38251565
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: The subset of rheumatoid arthritis that does not have autoantibodies (such as rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein autoantibodies) remains less well defined in its pathogenic mechanisms.
    explanation: Refers to RA without autoantibodies, supporting the statement that such a subtype exists.

  description: Onset of arthritis before the age of 16, persisting for at least 6 weeks.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35087087
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an umbrella term for arthritis of unknown origin, lasting for >6 weeks with onset before 16 years of age.
    explanation: The literature specifies that JIA is defined as arthritis lasting for more than 6 weeks with onset before 16 years, aligning with the statement. However, JIA is not a subtype of Rheumatoid Arthritis but rather a distinct condition.
  - reference: PMID:23763801
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: To determine the spectrum of clinical presentation, laboratory parameters and drug therapy in patients with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA).
    explanation: The study focuses on Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA), a term which is sometimes used synonymously with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) but does not explicitly define it as a subtype of Rheumatoid Arthritis.
  - reference: PMID:37700346
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Childhood-onset rheumatoid arthritis (CORA), known as rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that shares the same genetic factors and clinical features as adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis.
    explanation: This literature mentions that RF-positive juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a type of JIA sharing features with adult RA. It confirms that JIA has clinical overlap with RA but does not support that JIA is a subtype of RA.
  - reference: PMID:8465574
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: Ten to thirty-three per cent of all cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop after sixty years of age. Late-onset RA patients are more likely to be male, to have faster onset of symptoms...
    explanation: The literature provided does not discuss JIA or its relation as a subtype of RA.

  percentage: 0.5-1.0
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:24217093
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: A study in the UK found the population minimum prevalence of RA is 1.16% in women and 0.44% in men. In Australia, the estimated prevalence is 0.6%.
    explanation: While the prevalence of RA in the UK and Australia provides values that fall both below and slightly within the stated range (0.5-1.0%), it does not consistently support the global prevalence within that range.
  - reference: PMID:32712723
    supports: REFUTE
    snippet: According to the most recently published systematic reviews, pooled prevalence estimates for RA are 0.38% in North America, and 0.21 to 0.25% in European subregions.
    explanation: The prevalence estimates for North America and European subregions are significantly below the stated range (0.5-1.0%), thus not supporting the statement.
progression:
- phase: Onset
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:15588970
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: It suggests that the term 'early rheumatoid arthritis' is not appropriate and that patients either have established rheumatoid arthritis or an undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis.
    explanation: This reference argues against the categorization of 'early rheumatoid arthritis' and suggests that RA should be considered either as established or undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis, providing no evidence about the progression specifically at the onset phase.
  - reference: PMID:23926091
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: However, little is known about the characteristics of symptoms at the onset of a disease that eventually progresses to RA
    explanation: This study highlights the lack of comprehensive knowledge on the characteristics and progression of RA in its earliest phases, thus providing no evidence regarding the progression of RA specifically at the onset phase.
- age_range: 30-60
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:29039317
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: The disease severity increases with increase in the age and reaches to
      its peak in above 60 years of age (p=0.001). The pattern of progression of RA
      in the Pakistani patients is almost consistent with other relevant studies conducted
      on European and European derived populations.
    explanation: This study indicates that the progression of rheumatoid arthritis
      increases with age and is most severe in patients above 60. This indirectly
      supports the statement that progression can be observed in the age range of
      30-60, by confirming its increase towards the upper end of this range.
  - reference: PMID:34894251
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: Patients with all EORA features were more numerous with age and almost
      exclusively older than 65 years.
    explanation: This supports the idea that progression features become more prominent
      with age. As such, rheumatoid arthritis progression can be inferred for the
      age range of 30-60.
  - reference: PMID:24217093
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: A study in the UK found the population minimum prevalence of RA is 1.16%
      in women and 0.44% in men.
    explanation: Prevalence indicates the presence of the disease, which includes
      its progression over time. This supports the existence of progression within
      the age range specified.
  - reference: PMID:31899521
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: This study demonstrates improvements in inflammatory markers over time
      in early RA, in line with improved treatment strategies.
    explanation: The discussion about the progression of clinical and inflammatory
      markers over time implies that progression happens in various age groups including
      those within 30-60 years.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with progressive articular damage. Activated cells of the synovium produce pro-inflammatory and matrix-degrading effector molecules, which maintain the inflammation and lead to the destruction of the involved joints. In addition to macrophages and T- and B-cells, fibroblast-like synoviocytes must be considered key cells in driving the pathological processes. They can be distinguished by their transformed-appearing phenotype and their invasion into adjacent cartilage and bone.

    snippet: NSAID toxicity mostly affected the GI tract. There was a similar incidence
      of GI-related adverse events between patients with and patients without GI protection,
      mainly dyspepsia and nausea. NSAIDs have the potential to cause adverse events
      in the GI tract.
    explanation: The provided literature indicates that NSAIDs are used in the treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and can help alleviate pain, despite some potential
      side effects, thus supporting the statement.

      to reduce systemic and local inflammation, and can inhibit progression of structural
      damage in the spine.
    explanation: This indicates that NSAIDs are effective in reducing pain and inflammation
      in conditions similar to RA, thus supporting the statement.
  - reference: PMID:27278642
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: By examining confounds and limitations in the available literature it
      is suggested that current data suggest that only a sub-group of individuals
      with major depressive disorder (MDD) have evidence of increased inflammatory
      biomarkers and it is in these individuals that anti-inflammatory agents show
      promise for reducing depressive symptoms.
    explanation: While the reference primarily discusses the use of NSAIDs for major
      depressive disorder, it hints at the effectiveness of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation,
      partially supporting the statement.

    snippet: Methotrexate is presently the most popular of the DMARDs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and adenosine release and has a secondary effect on cytokines and polymorphonuclear chemotaxis. It is highly metabolised within cells and remains there for prolonged periods.
    explanation: This excerpt indicates methotrexate's mechanisms in treating RA, affirming its role in slowing disease progression and preventing joint damage.
  - reference: PMID:25172238
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: According to the results of several head-to-head comparative trials against other synthetic DMARDs, MTX has been recognised as the 'anchor drug' for the treatment of RA.
    explanation: This confirms methotrexate's effectiveness as a primary treatment in managing RA, thus supporting the statement.
  - reference: PMID:35953230
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Key recommendations are to start effective treatment immediately with DMARDs to reduce disability; use effective doses of methotrexate (oral or subcutaneous) with folic acid as the initial treatment; rapidly escalate treatment with various DMARDs, if methotrexate alone is not effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis.
    explanation: This supports the statement by advising DMARDs to prevent disease progression and joint damage.
