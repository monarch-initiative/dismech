name: Central Core Myopathy
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Central core myopathy (central core disease, CCD) is a congenital myopathy caused
  predominantly by mutations in the RYR1 gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine
  receptor (RyR1), the principal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel.
  It is characterized histopathologically by central cores — areas of sarcomeric
  disorganization and mitochondrial depletion running along the longitudinal axis
  of type 1 muscle fibers. Clinical features include proximal muscle weakness,
  hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, orthopaedic complications, and susceptibility
  to malignant hyperthermia. Inheritance is most commonly autosomal dominant with
  incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, though autosomal recessive forms
  exist and tend to be more severe. First described by Shy and Magee in 1956, CCD
  was the first congenital myopathy defined by a specific histological abnormality.

      Most cases of central core myopathy follow autosomal dominant inheritance
      with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Dominant mutations
      are typically missense changes clustered in recognized mutational hotspot
      regions including the C-terminal transmembrane/pore-forming domain and
      tend to cause a milder phenotype.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Abnormal RyR1 calcium release channel function
    description: >
      RYR1 mutations alter the function of the ryanodine receptor, the principal
      calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle.
      Dominant missense variants often produce hypersensitive or leaky RyR1
      channels with lowered threshold for sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release,
      while recessive mutations frequently result in reduced RyR1 protein
      expression or excitation-contraction coupling uncoupling. Both mechanisms
      disrupt the DHPR-RyR1 signaling axis and calcium homeostasis in skeletal
      muscle fibers.

  - name: Dantrolene for malignant hyperthermia
    description: >
      Dantrolene sodium is the specific treatment for acute malignant hyperthermia
      episodes. It acts by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic
      reticulum via the ryanodine receptor. Dantrolene should be immediately
      available whenever a susceptible patient undergoes anesthesia.

notes: >
  Central core myopathy was first described by Shy and Magee in 1956 and was the
  first congenital myopathy defined by a specific histological abnormality. The
  molecular basis was established in 1993 when Zhang et al. and Quane et al.
  independently identified RYR1 mutations in CCD families. The disease has
  significant allelic overlap with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS1),
  and a single mutation may result in either or both phenotypes. The clinical
  spectrum of RYR1-related myopathies extends beyond central core disease to
  include multiminicore disease, centronuclear myopathy, and congenital fiber
  type disproportion, reflecting complex genotype-phenotype relationships. In
  the majority of patients, weakness is static or only slowly progressive, with
  a favourable long-term outcome. Prevalence is unknown but the condition is
  probably more common than other congenital myopathies.
