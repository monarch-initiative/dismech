  Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) is the most common pediatric kidney malignancy,
  typically affecting children under 5 years of age. It exemplifies the concept
  of developmental cancer, arising from persistent embryonic renal blastemal
  cells that fail to undergo normal differentiation. Multiple genes are implicated
  including WT1, WTX (AMER1), and CTNNB1, which together regulate kidney development
  and Wnt signaling. Wilms tumor is one of the great successes of pediatric oncology,
  with cure rates exceeding 90% for favorable histology tumors through a combination
  of surgery, chemotherapy, and risk-adapted radiation. Anaplastic histology confers
  worse prognosis.

has_subtypes:
- name: Favorable Histology Wilms Tumor
  description: >-
    Approximately 90% of Wilms tumors have favorable histology without anaplasia.
    These tumors have excellent outcomes with >90% overall survival using current
    treatment protocols.
- name: Anaplastic Wilms Tumor
  description: >-
    Characterized by extreme nuclear enlargement and pleomorphism with atypical
    mitoses. May be focal or diffuse. Diffuse anaplasia confers significantly
    worse prognosis and requires treatment intensification.
- name: Bilateral Wilms Tumor
  description: >-
    Synchronous bilateral tumors occur in approximately 5% of cases and are
    enriched for germline WT1 mutations. Treatment aims for nephron-sparing
    approaches to preserve renal function.
pathophysiology:
- name: WT1 Inactivation
  description: >-
    WT1 is a transcription factor essential for normal kidney and gonad development.
    Biallelic WT1 inactivation occurs in 10-20% of Wilms tumors. Germline WT1
    mutations cause WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies,
    intellectual disability) and Denys-Drash syndrome.

- name: WTX/CTNNB1 Wnt Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    WTX (AMER1) is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling mutated in approximately
    15-20% of Wilms tumors. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) activating mutations occur in
    approximately 15% of cases. Both result in constitutive Wnt pathway activation,
    promoting proliferation and blocking differentiation.

  description: >-
    Wilms tumor arises from nephrogenic rests - foci of embryonic blastemal cells
    that persist beyond the normal period of nephrogenesis. These cells retain
    proliferative capacity but fail to undergo terminal differentiation into
    mature nephrons.

biochemical:
- name: Histopathology
  notes: >-
    Wilms tumor classically shows triphasic histology with blastemal, stromal,
    and epithelial components. The presence and distribution of anaplasia
    (diffuse vs focal) determines risk classification.
genetic:
- name: WT1 Mutations
  association: Tumor Suppressor Loss
  notes: >-
    WT1 mutations occur in 10-20% of sporadic Wilms tumors. Germline WT1 mutations
    cause predisposition syndromes (WAGR, Denys-Drash). WT1 is a transcription
    factor essential for kidney development.
- name: CTNNB1 Mutations
  association: Oncogenic Driver Mutations
  notes: >-
    Activating mutations in CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) occur in approximately 15%
    of Wilms tumors, leading to constitutive Wnt pathway activation.
- name: WTX (AMER1) Mutations
  association: Tumor Suppressor Loss
  notes: >-
    WTX inactivation occurs in 15-20% of Wilms tumors. WTX negatively regulates
    Wnt signaling, and its loss leads to pathway activation.
- name: Loss of 11p15 Imprinting
  association: Epigenetic Alteration
  notes: >-
    Loss of imprinting at 11p15, leading to biallelic IGF2 expression, occurs
    in approximately 70% of Wilms tumors. This is also the mechanism in
    Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
