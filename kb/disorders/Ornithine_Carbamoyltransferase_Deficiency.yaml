description: >
  Ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency (OTCD) is the most common urea cycle
  disorder, caused by pathogenic variants in the X-linked OTC gene. The encoded
  mitochondrial enzyme catalyzes the conversion of carbamoyl phosphate and
  ornithine to citrulline. Deficiency impairs ureagenesis, producing episodic or
  persistent hyperammonemia with risk of severe neurologic injury. Hemizygous
  males typically present with neonatal-onset disease, whereas heterozygous
  females and males with partial enzyme deficiency may present with later-onset
  intermittent hyperammonemia triggered by catabolic stress.
