parents:
- Neglected tropical disease
pathophysiology:
- name: Venom toxins with broad toxic actions
  description: Snake venoms are complex protein mixtures that cause diverse toxic effects.
  evidence:

    snippet: "Snake venoms are complex mixtures of proteins that exert a wide range of toxic actions."
    explanation: The abstract summarizes the toxic nature of snake venoms.
- name: Local and systemic effects driven by venom variability
  description: Variability in venom composition leads to a spectrum of clinical manifestations.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28905944
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The high variability in snake venom composition is responsible for the various clinical manifestations in envenomings, ranging from local tissue damage to potentially life-threatening systemic effects."
    explanation: The abstract links venom variability to local and systemic effects.
