  Ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS) is a rare autosomal dominant pleiotropic disorder
  caused by mutations in TBX3, a T-box transcription factor. It affects posterior
  (ulnar) limb elements, apocrine gland development (breast and axillary glands),
  teeth, and genitalia. TBX3 and the related TBX5 (mutated in Holt-Oram syndrome)
  evolved from a common ancestor and acquired complementary roles in limb patterning,
  with TBX3 responsible for posterior elements and TBX5 for anterior elements.

inheritance:

  description: >
    Autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expressivity. TBX3
    haploinsufficiency is the predicted mechanism for most mutations.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:9207801
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Each mutation (a single nucleotide deletion and a splice-site mutation) is predicted to cause haploinsufficiency of TBX3, implying that critical levels of this transcription factor are required for morphogenesis of several organs"
    explanation: "Demonstrates that TBX3 haploinsufficiency from heterozygous loss-of-function mutations is the pathogenic mechanism in autosomal dominant UMS."
pathophysiology:
- name: Posterior Limb Patterning Disruption
  description: >
    TBX3 is a T-box transcription factor that patterns posterior (ulnar)
    limb structures. TBX3 and TBX5 diverged from a common ancestral gene,
    acquiring complementary roles: TBX3 for posterior and TBX5 for anterior
    elements. Haploinsufficiency disrupts posterior limb morphogenesis,
    causing ulnar ray defects ranging from fifth finger hypoplasia to
    complete ulnar absence. T-domain disrupting mutations cause more
    severe limb defects.

- name: Apocrine Gland Development Failure
  description: >
    TBX3 is also required for development of apocrine glands, including
    mammary glands and axillary glands. Haploinsufficiency leads to
    hypoplasia or aplasia of breast tissue and absence of axillary hair,
    reflecting disrupted apocrine gland morphogenesis. This is a hallmark
    feature distinguishing UMS from other limb malformation syndromes.
