description: >-
  Hemophilia B is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by factor IX deficiency.
pathophysiology:
- name: Factor IX Deficiency
  description: >-
    Deficiency of coagulation factor IX impairs intrinsic pathway function and
    leads to abnormal bleeding.

    snippet: "Hemophilia B is a recessive X-linked bleeding disorder characterized by deficiency of the coagulation factor IX (FIX)."
    explanation: The abstract identifies factor IX deficiency as the cause of hemophilia B.

    snippet: "Hemophilia B treatment has improved greatly in the last 20 years with the introduction first of plasma-derived and then of recombinant FIX concentrates."
    explanation: The abstract notes factor IX concentrates as key treatment advances.
- name: Prophylactic Factor IX Replacement
  description: Regular prophylactic dosing to prevent bleeding and arthropathy.

    snippet: "Replacement therapy may be administered through on-demand or prophylaxis regimens, but the latter treatment modality has been shown to be superior in prevention of hemophilic arthropathy and in improvement of patients' quality of life."
    explanation: The abstract notes prophylaxis as a superior treatment modality for prevention of arthropathy.
  - reference: PMID:39950390

    snippet: "Prophylaxis with coagulation factor concentrates is the mainstay of treatment in severe hemophilia A and B."
    explanation: The abstract describes prophylactic factor replacement as the mainstay of treatment for severe hemophilia.
