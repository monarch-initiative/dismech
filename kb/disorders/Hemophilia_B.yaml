    label: hemophilia B
description: >-
  Hemophilia B is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by factor IX deficiency.
pathophysiology:
- name: Factor IX Deficiency
  description: >-
    Deficiency of coagulation factor IX impairs intrinsic pathway function and
    leads to abnormal bleeding.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:23430394
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Hemophilia B is a recessive X-linked bleeding disorder characterized
      by deficiency of the coagulation factor IX (FIX)."
    explanation: The abstract identifies factor IX deficiency as the cause of
      hemophilia B.
phenotypes:
- name: Abnormal Bleeding
  category: Hematologic
  frequency: VERY_FREQUENT

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Hemophilia B is a recessive X-linked bleeding disorder characterized
      by deficiency of the coagulation factor IX (FIX)."
    explanation: The abstract describes hemophilia B as a bleeding disorder.
treatments:
- name: Factor IX Replacement
  description: Plasma-derived or recombinant factor IX concentrates for
    on-demand or prophylactic therapy.
  treatment_term:
    preferred_term: pharmacotherapy
    term:
      id: MAXO:0000058
      label: pharmacotherapy
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:23430394
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Hemophilia B treatment has improved greatly in the last 20 years with
      the introduction first of plasma-derived and then of recombinant FIX concentrates."
    explanation: The abstract notes factor IX concentrates as key treatment
      advances.
- name: Prophylactic Factor IX Replacement
  description: Regular prophylactic dosing to prevent bleeding and arthropathy.
  treatment_term:
    preferred_term: pharmacotherapy
    term:
      id: MAXO:0000058
      label: pharmacotherapy
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:23430394
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Replacement therapy may be administered through on-demand or prophylaxis
      regimens, but the latter treatment modality has been shown to be superior in
      prevention of hemophilic arthropathy and in improvement of patients' quality
      of life."
    explanation: The abstract notes prophylaxis as a superior treatment modality
      for prevention of arthropathy.
  - reference: PMID:39950390
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Prophylaxis with coagulation factor concentrates is the mainstay of
      treatment in severe hemophilia A and B."
    explanation: The abstract describes prophylactic factor replacement as the
      mainstay of treatment for severe hemophilia.
