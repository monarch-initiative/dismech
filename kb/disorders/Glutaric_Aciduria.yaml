description: 'Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiency of
  glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH), which catalyzes the final step of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan catabolism. GCDH
  deficiency leads to accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites glutaric acid (GA), 3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3-OH-GA), and glutarylcarnitine
  (C5DC). Affected individuals are at high risk for acute encephalopathic crises during infancy (typically 3-36 months), triggered
  by catabolic stress, which cause irreversible bilateral striatal necrosis and a complex dystonic movement disorder. Early
  diagnosis through newborn screening and adherence to metabolic treatment including lysine-restricted diet, carnitine supplementation,
  and emergency management during intercurrent illness can prevent striatal injury in the majority of patients.
