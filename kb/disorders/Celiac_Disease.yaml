pathophysiology:
- name: Gluten-Triggered Immune Response
  description: >
    Gluten peptides (gliadin) cross the intestinal epithelium and are
    deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Deamidated peptides
    bind HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and activate CD4+ T cells.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:10684852
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-mediated deamidation of gliadin plays an important role in recognition of this food antigen by intestinal T cells"
    explanation: Demonstrates the critical role of tTG deamidation in converting gluten peptides into immunogenic epitopes recognized by T cells in celiac disease.
  - reference: PMID:10684852
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "the deamidated peptides displayed an increased affinity for DQ2, a molecule known to preferentially bind peptides containing negatively charged residues"
    explanation: Shows how tTG deamidation increases HLA-DQ2 binding affinity by introducing negatively charged glutamate residues, enhancing antigen presentation.
  - reference: PMID:38914866
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CeD) by deamidating dietary gluten peptides, which facilitates antigenic presentation and a strong anti-gluten T cell response."
    explanation: Confirms TG2 deamidation as the pivotal mechanism enabling gluten peptide presentation and T cell activation in celiac disease pathogenesis.
- name: Intestinal Epithelial Damage
  description: >
    Activated T cells release IFN-gamma and other cytokines causing
    villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial
    lymphocytes. Leads to malabsorption.

      label: apoptotic process
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38914866
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Nearly half of the gluten-induced gene expression changes in CeD were associated with the epithelial interferon-γ response."
    explanation: Demonstrates that IFN-gamma signaling drives a major portion of the transcriptional changes underlying epithelial damage in celiac disease.
  - reference: PMID:15357947
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "under conditions of dysregulated IL15 expression in vivo in patients with celiac disease and in vitro in healthy individuals, multiple steps of the NKG2D/DAP10 signaling pathway leading to ERK and JNK activation are coordinately primed to activate direct cytolytic function independent of TCR specificity in effector CD8 T cells"
    explanation: Shows how IL-15 converts intraepithelial CD8+ T cells into cytotoxic lymphokine-activated killer cells via NKG2D signaling, mediating epithelial damage.
  - reference: PMID:24942692
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "the upregulation of IL-15 expression in the intestinal mucosa has become a hallmark of the disease"
    explanation: Identifies IL-15 upregulation as a defining feature of celiac disease that drives intraepithelial lymphocyte expansion and epithelial injury.
  - reference: PMID:38914866
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "ZED1227 treatment preserved transcriptome signatures associated with mucosal morphology, inflammation, cell differentiation and nutrient absorption to the level of the gluten-free diet group."
    explanation: Provides interventional evidence that blocking TG2-mediated T cell activation prevents the downstream epithelial damage, villous atrophy, and malabsorption.
- name: Autoantibody Production
  description: >
    B cells produce antibodies against tTG (anti-tTG IgA) and
    deamidated gliadin peptides (anti-DGP). These serve as diagnostic
    markers and may contribute to pathology.

    snippet: "Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of proline- and glutamine-rich proteins, widely termed \"gluten\", in genetically susceptible individuals. CD induces an altered immune response that leads to chronic inflammation and duodenal mucosal damage."
    explanation: Describes the immune-mediated nature of celiac disease, which includes both cellular and humoral (antibody) responses to gluten antigens.
- name: Barrier Dysfunction
  description: >
    Increased intestinal permeability allows greater gluten peptide
    translocation. Zonulin upregulation disrupts tight junctions.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38914866
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "ZED1227 treatment preserved transcriptome signatures associated with mucosal morphology, inflammation, cell differentiation and nutrient absorption to the level of the gluten-free diet group."
    explanation: Blocking TG2 prevents gluten-induced disruption of epithelial barrier integrity and differentiation programs, indicating barrier dysfunction is downstream of adaptive immune activation.
