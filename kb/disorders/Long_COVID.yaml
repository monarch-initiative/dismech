  Long COVID, formally designated as Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC),
  is a complex, multisystem condition characterized by persistent symptoms following
  resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The condition can develop following both
  mild and severe acute illness and affects an estimated 65 million individuals worldwide.

notes: >
  Long COVID shares substantial clinical and biological overlap with myalgic
  encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and postural orthostatic
  tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Risk factors for developing Long COVID include
  female sex, type 2 diabetes, pre-existing autoimmune conditions, and evidence
  of EBV reactivation during acute infection. The condition can occur following
  both mild and severe acute illness and may present as a relapsing-remitting
  course with new symptoms emerging months to years after initial infection.
