description: >-
  Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer is a molecularly defined subtype
  characterized by deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR), resulting in hypermutation and high
  tumor mutational burden (TMB). This occurs through germline mutations in MMR genes (Lynch
  syndrome) or sporadic MLH1 promoter hypermethylation. MSI-H tumors have distinct clinical
  features including proximal colon predominance, mucinous histology, and tumor-infiltrating
  lymphocytes. The high neoantigen load makes these tumors exquisitely sensitive to immune
  checkpoint inhibitors, with pembrolizumab now approved as first-line therapy for metastatic
  MSI-H colorectal cancer.

- name: Lynch Syndrome-Associated MSI-H CRC
  description: >-
    Hereditary MSI-H colorectal cancer caused by germline mutations in MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2,
    MSH6, PMS2) or EPCAM deletions affecting MSH2. Accounts for approximately 3% of all CRC.
    Younger age at onset, right-sided predominance, and risk of synchronous/metachronous cancers.

    snippet: >-
      Colorectal cancers resulting from defective DNA mismatch repair can occur in both
      hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) and in the sporadic setting.
    explanation: >-
      Study confirms that MSI-H colorectal cancers can arise from hereditary (HNPCC/Lynch
      syndrome) or sporadic causes.
- name: Sporadic MSI-H CRC
  description: >-
    Non-hereditary MSI-H colorectal cancer caused by biallelic MLH1 promoter hypermethylation,
    often with concurrent BRAF V600E mutation. Typically occurs in older patients, predominantly
    female, with right-sided tumors.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:15340260
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: >-
      BRAF mutations were detected in 74% of sporadic tumours but none of the HNPCC
      cancers tested.
    explanation: >-
      Study demonstrates that BRAF mutations distinguish sporadic MSI-H CRC from Lynch
      syndrome-associated tumors.
pathophysiology:
- name: DNA Mismatch Repair Deficiency
  description: >-
    Loss of MMR protein function (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2) impairs the recognition and repair
    of DNA replication errors. The MMR system normally corrects base-base mismatches and
    insertion/deletion loops at microsatellite sequences. Deficiency leads to accumulation of
    thousands of somatic mutations.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:41113075
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: High microsatellite instability (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC), caused by deficient mismatch repair, 
      accounts for about 15% of all CRC cases and is more common in right-sided tumors.
    explanation: This abstract explicitly links MSI-H CRC to deficient mismatch repair, supporting the core disease 
      mechanism described.

  description: >-
    Microsatellites are repetitive DNA sequences highly susceptible to replication errors.
    Without functional MMR, these sequences accumulate insertions and deletions, detectable
    as length variations (instability) compared to normal tissue. MSI-H is defined as
    instability at two or more of five standard markers.

- name: Hypermutation and High TMB
  description: >-
    MSI-H tumors accumulate 10-100 times more somatic mutations than microsatellite stable
    tumors, resulting in tumor mutational burden often exceeding 10-20 mutations per megabase.
    This creates abundant neoantigens derived from mutant peptides presented on MHC molecules.

  description: >-
    Coding microsatellites in tumor suppressor genes (TGFbetaRII, BAX, ACVR2, IGF2R) accumulate
    frameshift mutations, inactivating their tumor suppressive functions. TGFbetaRII frameshift
    is particularly common, disrupting TGF-beta growth inhibition.

  description: >-
    The high neoantigen burden in MSI-H tumors stimulates robust anti-tumor immunity.
    Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, recognize and
    attack tumor cells presenting neoantigens. However, tumors upregulate PD-L1 as an
    adaptive resistance mechanism.

    description: Tumors adaptively upregulate checkpoint ligands to suppress T cell attack
- name: PD-L1 Upregulation and Immune Evasion
  description: >-
    MSI-H tumors upregulate PD-L1 expression in response to interferon-gamma from
    infiltrating T cells. PD-L1 engagement of PD-1 on T cells suppresses cytotoxic function,
    allowing immune evasion despite the immunogenic microenvironment. This makes MSI-H
    tumors vulnerable to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.

biochemical:
- name: MSI Testing
  notes: >-
    PCR-based testing of five microsatellite markers (Bethesda panel) or expanded panels.
    MSI-H defined as instability at two or more markers. Next-generation sequencing can
    also detect MSI status.
- name: MMR Immunohistochemistry
  notes: >-
    Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 proteins. Loss of expression
    indicates MMR deficiency. MLH1/PMS2 loss with concurrent BRAF V600E suggests sporadic
    MSI-H; isolated MSH2/MSH6 loss suggests Lynch syndrome.
- name: Tumor Mutational Burden
  notes: >-
    MSI-H tumors typically have TMB greater than 10 mutations per megabase, often 20-40 mut/Mb.
    High TMB correlates with checkpoint inhibitor response and can be assessed by NGS panels.
genetic:
- name: MLH1
  association: Loss of Function (Somatic or Germline)
  notes: >-
    MLH1 loss occurs via germline mutation (Lynch syndrome) or somatic promoter hypermethylation
    (sporadic). MLH1 hypermethylation accounts for 80% of sporadic MSI-H CRC and is often
    associated with BRAF V600E mutation.
- name: MSH2
  association: Germline Loss of Function
  notes: >-
    MSH2 germline mutations are the second most common cause of Lynch syndrome. EPCAM deletions
    can also cause MSH2 silencing through promoter methylation.
- name: MSH6
  association: Germline Loss of Function
  notes: >-
    MSH6 germline mutations cause Lynch syndrome with attenuated phenotype and later age of onset.
- name: PMS2
  association: Germline Loss of Function
  notes: >-
    PMS2 germline mutations cause Lynch syndrome with lower penetrance than MLH1/MSH2 mutations.
- name: BRAF V600E
  association: Somatic Activating Mutation (Sporadic MSI-H)
  notes: >-
    BRAF V600E is present in approximately 40-50% of sporadic MSI-H CRC, virtually always
    with MLH1 hypermethylation. Its presence excludes Lynch syndrome. Unlike MSS BRAF-mutant
    CRC, MSI-H BRAF-mutant tumors respond well to checkpoint inhibitors.
