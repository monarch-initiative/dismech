    adhesion, and inflammatory cell recruitment. Reduced nitric oxide
    production impairs vasodilation.

    snippet: "Atherosclerosis tends to occur in regions of disturbed blood flow. This study explored how disturbed flow aggravates atherosclerosis using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets from mouse carotid arteries under disturbed flow and human carotid artery plaques."
    explanation: Disturbed flow-induced endothelial dysfunction is a primary mechanism for atherosclerosis initiation in specific arterial regions.
- name: Plaque Rupture and Thrombosis
  description: >
    Unstable plaques with thin fibrous caps are prone to rupture, exposing
    thrombogenic material and triggering acute coronary events (myocardial
    infarction).

    snippet: "Notable increases in VEGFA+ macrophages were discovered in the disturbed flow stimulation group, displaying a pronounced M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype associated with the severity of atherosclerosis and plaque stability."
    explanation: Pro-inflammatory macrophages contribute to plaque instability, which predisposes to rupture and thrombotic complications.
  - reference: PMID:38639096
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "By identifying and integrating the most gene-rich single-cell subclusters of atherosclerosis to date with a coronary artery disease framework of GRNs, GRN39 was identified and independently validated as being critical for the transformation of contractile SMCs into an osteogenic phenotype promoting advanced, symptomatic atherosclerosis."
    explanation: Smooth muscle cell transformation into osteogenic phenotypes contributes to plaque vulnerability and symptomatic disease, increasing risk of rupture and thrombotic events.
