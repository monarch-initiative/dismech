description: >-
  A chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis
  of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to multifocal strictures
  and eventual biliary cirrhosis. Strongly associated with inflammatory bowel
  disease, particularly ulcerative colitis.
pathophysiology:
- name: Bile Duct Inflammation and Fibrosis
  description: >-
    Periductal inflammation with concentric fibrosis (onion-skinning) leads
    to progressive stricture formation. Both innate and adaptive immune cells
    infiltrate the bile duct epithelium.

      Cholangiopathies comprise a spectrum of chronic intrahepatic and extrahepatic
      biliary tract disorders culminating in progressive cholestatic liver injury,
      fibrosis, and often cirrhosis and its sequela.
    explanation: >-
      Demonstrates that PSC involves progressive fibrosis as a core pathological
      feature of biliary tract disorders.

    snippet: >-
      Herein, we review the pivotal role of cholangiocytes in cholestatic fibrogenesis,
      focusing on the crosstalk between cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts and HSCs.
    explanation: >-
      Confirms the central role of fibroblast-cholangiocyte crosstalk in driving
      periductal fibrosis in PSC.
- name: Gut-Liver Axis Dysregulation
  description: >-
    Aberrant homing of gut-primed lymphocytes to the liver through shared
    adhesion molecules (MAdCAM-1, CCL25). Bacterial translocation and altered
    bile acid metabolism contribute to hepatic inflammation.

    snippet: >-
      The crosstalk between cholangiocytes and cells of the innate (neutrophils
      and macrophages) and adaptive (T cells and B cells) immune systems is also
      examined in detail.
    explanation: >-
      Confirms the role of adaptive immune cells, particularly T cells, in the
      pathogenesis of cholestatic liver diseases including PSC.
- name: Cholangiocyte Senescence
  description: >-
    Biliary epithelial cells undergo premature senescence with SASP (senescence-
    associated secretory phenotype), promoting inflammation and fibrosis
    through release of pro-inflammatory mediators.

  - preferred_term: Cellular Senescence
    term:
      id: GO:0090398
      label: cellular senescence
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:39250501
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      The proclivity of these cells to undergo a senescence-associated secretory
      phenotype, which is proinflammatory and profibrogenic, and the intrinsic
      intracellular activation pathways resulting in the secretion of cytokines
      and chemokines are reviewed.
    explanation: >-
      Directly supports that cholangiocytes undergo senescence-associated secretory
      phenotype that drives inflammation and fibrosis in cholestatic diseases.
