description: >-
  HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the classical form
  of head and neck cancer, strongly associated with tobacco and alcohol use. It is
  genetically characterized by TP53 mutations (greater than 80%), CDKN2A inactivation,
  and frequent EGFR amplification or overexpression. HPV-negative HNSCC has a worse
  prognosis than HPV-positive disease, with 5-year survival rates of 40-50% for
  locally advanced tumors. The disease commonly affects the oral cavity, larynx,
  and hypopharynx.

has_subtypes:
- name: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Carcinoma arising from the mucosal lining of the oral cavity including
    the lips, buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, oral tongue, hard palate, and
    retromolar trigone. Strongly associated with tobacco and alcohol.
- name: Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Carcinoma of the larynx (voice box) affecting the glottic, supraglottic,
    or subglottic regions. Smoking is the dominant risk factor. Presents
    early with hoarseness when affecting the vocal cords.
- name: Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Carcinoma of the hypopharynx (lower throat), including pyriform sinuses,
    posterior pharyngeal wall, and postcricoid region. Often presents at
    advanced stage with poor prognosis.
environmental:
- name: Tobacco Smoking
  description: >-
    Cigarette smoking is the dominant risk factor for HPV-negative HNSCC,
    with a dose-response relationship. Tobacco smoke contains numerous
    carcinogens including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines
    that cause DNA adducts and mutations, particularly in TP53.

- name: Alcohol Consumption
  description: >-
    Chronic alcohol consumption synergizes with tobacco to increase HNSCC
    risk multiplicatively. Alcohol acts as a solvent enhancing carcinogen
    penetration and is metabolized to acetaldehyde, a DNA-damaging agent.
    Ethanol is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by IARC.

pathophysiology:
- name: TP53 Mutation and Inactivation
  description: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in greater than 80% of HPV-negative HNSCC, representing
    the most common genetic alteration. Mutations are typically missense
    mutations in the DNA-binding domain caused by tobacco carcinogen-induced
    DNA adducts. Loss of p53 function eliminates cell cycle checkpoints
    and DNA damage repair.

biochemical:
- name: p16 Immunohistochemistry
  notes: >-
    Unlike HPV-positive HNSCC, p16 is typically negative or focally/weakly
    positive in HPV-negative tumors due to CDKN2A inactivation. p16 status
    is critical for staging oropharyngeal carcinoma in the 8th edition AJCC
    staging system.
- name: EGFR Expression
  notes: >-
    EGFR overexpression is common but has not proven useful as a predictive
    biomarker for cetuximab response. EGFR gene copy number and mutations
    are less common than overexpression.
genetic:

  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in greater than 80% of HPV-negative HNSCC. Mutation
    spectrum shows tobacco carcinogen signature with G-to-T transversions.

    CDKN2A is inactivated in 60-70% of HPV-negative HNSCC through homozygous
    deletion, promoter hypermethylation, or point mutation.
