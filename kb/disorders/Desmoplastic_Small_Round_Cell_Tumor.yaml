name: Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor
description: >-
  Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a highly aggressive mesenchymal
  malignancy characterized by the pathognomonic EWSR1-WT1 fusion gene resulting
  from t(11;22)(p13;q12). This fusion combines the transcriptional activation
  domain of EWSR1 with the DNA-binding zinc fingers of WT1, creating an aberrant
  transcription factor. DSRCT predominantly affects adolescent and young adult
  males, typically presenting with diffuse peritoneal involvement and bulky
  abdominal masses. Despite aggressive multimodal treatment, prognosis remains
  poor with 5-year survival rates under 20%. The unique biology of DSRCT reflects
  its hybrid phenotype with expression of epithelial, mesenchymal, and neural
  markers.

has_subtypes:
- name: Intra-Abdominal DSRCT
  description: >-
    The classic presentation with multiple peritoneal implants studding the
    abdominal cavity. Primary tumor may arise from the peritoneum, omentum,
    or mesentery.
- name: Extra-Abdominal DSRCT
  description: >-
    Rare cases arising in other locations including paratesticular region,
    ovary, pleura, or soft tissues. Shares the same EWSR1-WT1 fusion and
    histologic features.
pathophysiology:
- name: EWSR1-WT1 Fusion Oncogene
  description: >-
    The t(11;22)(p13;q12) translocation fuses EWSR1 on chromosome 22 with WT1
    on chromosome 11. The resulting fusion protein contains the potent
    transcriptional activation domain of EWSR1 fused to the zinc finger
    DNA-binding domain of WT1. This chimeric transcription factor activates
    aberrant gene expression programs including PDGFA.

    snippet: "Using microdissection techniques, EWS-WT1-gene fusion transcripts were detected in the cystic (single-cell-layered),
      the papillary and the solid tumor proliferations (exon 7 of EWS on chromosome 22 with exon 8 of WT1 on chromosome 11)."

    EWSR1-WT1 directly activates transcription of PDGFA, creating an autocrine
    growth loop that stimulates tumor cell proliferation and may contribute
    to the characteristic desmoplastic stromal reaction.

    DSRCT displays a unique multiphenotypic immunophenotype with co-expression

biochemical:
- name: EWSR1-WT1 Fusion Detection
  notes: >-
    RT-PCR or FISH detection of the EWSR1-WT1 fusion is diagnostic. The fusion
    is virtually pathognomonic for DSRCT and not seen in other tumors.
- name: Multiphenotypic Markers
  notes: >-
    Immunohistochemistry shows characteristic co-expression of cytokeratin,
    desmin (often with paranuclear dot pattern), and WT1 (C-terminus antibody
    positive, which detects the fusion protein).
genetic:
- name: EWSR1-WT1 Fusion
  association: Somatic Fusion Oncogene
  notes: >-
    The t(11;22)(p13;q12) translocation creates the EWSR1-WT1 fusion in
    virtually all DSRCT cases. This fusion is both diagnostic and represents
    the primary oncogenic driver.
