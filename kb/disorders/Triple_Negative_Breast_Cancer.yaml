name: Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
description: >-
  Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a molecularly-defined subtype of breast
  cancer characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
  receptor (PR), and HER2 expression. TNBC represents approximately 10-20% of
  breast cancers and is clinically aggressive with higher rates of recurrence
  and visceral/brain metastases. TNBC is molecularly heterogeneous, encompassing
  several intrinsic subtypes including basal-like, mesenchymal, and
  immunomodulatory. Treatment relies on chemotherapy and increasingly immunotherapy,
  as hormonal and HER2-targeted therapies are ineffective by definition.

has_subtypes:
- name: Basal-like TNBC
  description: >-
    The most common TNBC subtype (50-75%), characterized by expression of basal
    cytokeratins (CK5/6, CK14, CK17), EGFR expression, high proliferation, and
    frequent TP53 and BRCA1 mutations. Overlaps significantly with BRCA1-associated
    breast cancer.
- name: Mesenchymal TNBC
  description: >-
    Characterized by epithelial-mesenchymal transition features, enrichment in
    cell motility and differentiation pathways. May respond to PI3K/mTOR inhibition.
- name: Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR) TNBC
  description: >-
    Despite being ER/PR-negative, LAR tumors express androgen receptor and have
    luminal gene expression patterns. May benefit from androgen receptor-targeted
    therapy. Often have PIK3CA mutations.
- name: Immunomodulatory TNBC
  description: >-
    Characterized by immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression.
    Best responders to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
pathophysiology:
- name: Loss of Hormone Receptor Signaling
  description: >-
    TNBC lacks expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and progesterone
    receptor (PGR), eliminating the growth-promoting effects of estrogen signaling
    that drive most breast cancers. This absence removes a key therapeutic target
    but also indicates fundamentally different tumor biology.

    snippet: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, remains clinically challenging due to the lack of effective targeted therapies.
    explanation: This abstract defines TNBC by the absence of ER, PR, and HER2 expression, matching the mechanism described.

    description: Other signaling pathways drive proliferation in absence of ER
- name: Alternative Oncogenic Pathways
  description: >-
    In the absence of hormone receptor signaling, TNBC is driven by alternative
    oncogenic pathways including EGFR signaling, PI3K-AKT-mTOR activation, and
    Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Many TNBCs have TP53 mutations eliminating this
    tumor suppressor checkpoint.

- name: DNA Repair Deficiency
  description: >-
    A significant subset of TNBC (~20%) harbors germline or somatic BRCA1/2
    mutations resulting in homologous recombination deficiency. This creates
    sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors through synthetic
    lethality.

- name: Aggressive Tumor Behavior
  description: >-
    TNBC is characterized by high proliferation rates, early metastasis (especially
    to viscera and brain), and shorter time to recurrence compared to other breast
    cancer subtypes. The aggressive biology reflects activation of multiple
    oncogenic pathways and loss of tumor suppressors.

- name: Hormone Receptor and HER2 Testing
  notes: >-
    Diagnosis requires testing for ER, PR (by IHC), and HER2 (by IHC and/or FISH).
    Triple-negative is defined as ER <1%, PR <1%, and HER2 0-1+ or non-amplified.
    PD-L1 testing (CPS or SP142) is recommended for treatment selection.
- name: BRCA1/2 Testing
  notes: >-
    Germline BRCA1/2 testing is recommended for all TNBC patients given high
    prevalence of mutations (~15-20%) and therapeutic implications (PARP inhibitors).
    Somatic testing may identify additional HRD-positive tumors.
