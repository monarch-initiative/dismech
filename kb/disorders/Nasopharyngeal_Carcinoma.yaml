description: >-
  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique head and neck malignancy arising from
  the epithelium of the nasopharynx, with a distinctive epidemiologic and etiologic
  profile. It is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which
  is present in nearly 100% of non-keratinizing NPC. The disease shows remarkable
  geographic variation, with high incidence in southern China, Southeast Asia, and
  among Inuit populations. NPC is highly radiosensitive and chemosensitive, with
  good cure rates for locoregional disease but poor prognosis for distant metastases.

has_subtypes:
- name: Non-keratinizing Carcinoma
  description: >-
    The most common type (greater than 95% in endemic areas), characterized by
    poorly differentiated cells without keratinization. Further subdivided into
    differentiated and undifferentiated subtypes. Virtually always EBV-positive.
- name: Keratinizing Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    A minority subtype (approximately 25% in non-endemic areas) showing squamous
    differentiation with keratin formation. More similar to other HNSCC, often
    associated with tobacco and alcohol rather than EBV.
infectious_agent:
- name: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
  description: >-
    EBV is present in virtually all non-keratinizing NPC and is essential for
    carcinogenesis. The virus establishes latent infection with expression of
    specific viral proteins (LMP1, LMP2, EBNA1) and non-coding RNAs (EBERs,
    BARTs) that drive oncogenic transformation.

    snippet: "In addition to its involvement in a wide range of malignancies such as lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric cancer, recent evidence has shown its potential association with autoimmune diseases, positioning EBV as an interdisciplinary research model linking virology, oncology, and immunology."

pathophysiology:
- name: EBV Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) Signaling
  description: >-
    LMP1 is the primary EBV oncoprotein in NPC, functioning as a constitutively
    active receptor that mimics CD40 signaling. LMP1 activates NF-kB, MAPK,
    and PI3K/AKT pathways, promoting cell survival, proliferation, and
    epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

- name: LMP2A-Mediated B Cell Receptor Mimicry
  description: >-
    LMP2A is a viral protein that mimics an activated B cell receptor,
    providing survival signals that prevent viral lytic reactivation and
    maintain latency. In epithelial cells, LMP2A activates PI3K/AKT and
    promotes cell motility.

- name: EBNA1-Mediated Viral Maintenance
  description: >-
    EBNA1 is essential for EBV genome replication and maintenance during
    latency. It tethers viral episomes to host chromosomes and contributes
    to genomic instability by inducing oxidative stress and interfering
    with DNA damage responses.

  description: >-
    Specific HLA haplotypes, particularly HLA-A2, are associated with
    increased NPC risk in endemic populations. Additional susceptibility
    loci have been identified in GWAS studies, including genes involved
    in immune function and DNA repair.
  genes:

- name: Immune Evasion
  description: >-
    EBV-infected NPC cells evade immune surveillance through multiple
    mechanisms including PD-L1 upregulation, suppression of antigen
    presentation, and recruitment of regulatory T cells. This provides
    rationale for immune checkpoint inhibition.

biochemical:
- name: EBV DNA (Plasma)
  notes: >-
    Circulating EBV DNA is a sensitive and specific biomarker for NPC.
    Plasma EBV DNA levels correlate with tumor burden and can be used
    for screening in endemic populations, diagnosis, monitoring treatment
    response, and surveillance for recurrence.
- name: EBV-Encoded RNA (EBERs) In Situ Hybridization
  notes: >-
    Detection of EBERs by in situ hybridization confirms EBV presence
    in tumor cells and is the gold standard for diagnosing EBV-associated
    NPC.
genetic:
- name: HLA-A
  association: Susceptibility Alleles
  notes: >-
    HLA-A2 and other specific HLA alleles are associated with increased
    NPC risk in endemic populations. The HLA region shows the strongest
    genetic association with NPC susceptibility.
- name: TP53
  association: Occasionally Mutated
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations are less common in NPC than in HPV-negative HNSCC,
    occurring in approximately 10% of cases.
- name: CDKN2A
  association: Deletion/Methylation
  notes: >-
    CDKN2A inactivation through homozygous deletion or promoter methylation
    occurs in approximately 30-50% of NPC, contributing to cell cycle
    dysregulation.
- name: NF-kB Pathway Alterations
  association: Various Mutations
  notes: >-
    Mutations in NF-kB pathway genes (TRAF3, CYLD, NFKBIA) occur in
    approximately 30-40% of NPC, leading to constitutive NF-kB activation
    independent of LMP1.
