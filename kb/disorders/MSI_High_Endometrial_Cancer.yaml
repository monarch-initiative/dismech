description: >-
  MSI-high endometrial cancer is a molecularly-defined subset of endometrial carcinoma
  characterized by deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) and high microsatellite instability
  (MSI-H). This phenotype occurs in approximately 25-30% of endometrial cancers and
  may arise from germline MMR gene mutations (Lynch syndrome) or somatic MLH1 promoter
  hypermethylation. MSI-H tumors have hypermutated genomes generating neoantigens that
  make them highly responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition. The combination of
  pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib has transformed treatment of advanced MSI-H endometrial
  cancer.

has_subtypes:
- name: Lynch Syndrome-Associated Endometrial Cancer
  description: >-
    Germline mutations in MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) cause Lynch syndrome
    with substantially increased lifetime risk of endometrial cancer. Regular
    surveillance and risk-reducing surgery may be considered.

    snippet: >-
      Colorectal cancers resulting from defective DNA mismatch repair can occur
      in both hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) and in the sporadic
      setting.
    explanation: >-
      This study establishes that MMR-deficient cancers can arise from hereditary
      (Lynch syndrome) or sporadic causes, applicable to endometrial cancer as well.
- name: Sporadic MSI-H Endometrial Cancer
  description: >-
    Most common subtype caused by somatic MLH1 promoter hypermethylation leading
    to loss of MLH1/PMS2 expression. Not associated with germline mutations or
    increased cancer risk in family members.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:15340260
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      significant differences can be demonstrated at the molecular level including
      widespread promoter hypermethylation and BRAF -activating mutations which
      occur significantly less often in HNPCC
    explanation: >-
      Study demonstrates that sporadic MSI-H tumors are characterized by promoter
      hypermethylation, distinguishing them from Lynch syndrome cases.
pathophysiology:
- name: Mismatch Repair Deficiency
  description: >-
    Loss of functional mismatch repair (MMR) proteins impairs the ability to
    correct base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops during DNA replication.
    This leads to accumulation of mutations, particularly at microsatellite regions.

biochemical:

  notes: >-
    Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is standard for detecting
    dMMR. Loss of MLH1/PMS2 suggests sporadic hypermethylation; loss of MSH2/MSH6
    suggests germline mutation.

    next-generation sequencing confirms MSI-H status.
