name: Small Cell Lung Cancer
description: >-
  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine lung malignancy
  characterized by rapid growth, early metastasis, and initial chemosensitivity followed
  by near-universal relapse. SCLC accounts for approximately 13-15% of lung cancers and
  is strongly associated with tobacco smoking. Molecularly, SCLC is defined by near-universal
  inactivation of both TP53 and RB1 tumor suppressors, leading to loss of cell cycle
  checkpoints and genomic instability. Unlike NSCLC, SCLC lacks actionable driver mutations
  and is treated primarily with chemotherapy plus immunotherapy. Despite high initial
  response rates, long-term survival remains poor.

has_subtypes:
- name: Limited-Stage SCLC
  description: >-
    Disease confined to one hemithorax that can be encompassed within a tolerable
    radiation field. Approximately 30% of SCLC presents as limited-stage. Treatment
    includes concurrent chemoradiation with potential for cure.
- name: Extensive-Stage SCLC
  description: >-
    Disease beyond a single hemithorax or with distant metastases. Approximately
    70% of SCLC presents as extensive-stage. Treated with chemotherapy plus
    immunotherapy; not curable but can achieve meaningful responses.
- name: SCLC-A (ASCL1-high)
  description: >-
    SCLC subtype defined by high ASCL1 expression. Associated with classic
    neuroendocrine phenotype and may respond differently to therapy.
- name: SCLC-N (NEUROD1-high)
  description: >-
    SCLC subtype defined by high NEUROD1 expression. Variant neuroendocrine
    phenotype.
- name: SCLC-P (POU2F3-high)
  description: >-
    SCLC subtype defined by high POU2F3 expression. Tuft cell-like phenotype,
    may lack classic neuroendocrine markers.
- name: SCLC-Y (YAP1-high)
  description: >-
    SCLC subtype with YAP1 activation. Non-neuroendocrine phenotype, may arise
    from epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
environmental:
- name: Tobacco Smoking
  description: >-
    Cigarette smoking is the dominant risk factor for SCLC, with a much stronger
    association than for lung adenocarcinoma. Tobacco carcinogens drive widespread
    genomic damage and contribute to TP53 and RB1 inactivation.

    SCLC expresses neuroendocrine markers: synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and

genetic:
- name: TP53

  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    TP53 (17p13.1) is inactivated in >90% of SCLC through biallelic mutations
    or deletions. Loss of p53 is considered a defining feature of SCLC.
    Combined with RB1 loss, this creates the aggressive phenotype.
- name: RB1
  association: Somatic Inactivating Mutation
  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    RB1 (13q14.2) is inactivated in >90% of SCLC through biallelic mutations
    or deletions. Combined TP53/RB1 loss is essentially universal in SCLC
    and serves as a molecular definition of the disease.
- name: MYC
  association: Amplification
  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    MYC family amplification (MYC, MYCL, MYCN) occurs in ~20% of SCLC.
    MYC amplification is associated with variant histology and worse prognosis.
    May predict response to certain therapeutic approaches (Aurora kinase
    inhibitors, chemotherapy timing).
- name: NOTCH
  association: Somatic Inactivating Mutation
  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    NOTCH family members (especially NOTCH1) are inactivated in ~25% of SCLC.
    NOTCH normally suppresses neuroendocrine differentiation; its loss promotes
    the neuroendocrine phenotype.
