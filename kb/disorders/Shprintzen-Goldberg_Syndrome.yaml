description: >
  Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue
  disorder caused by mutations in SKI, encoding the SKI proto-oncoprotein, a negative
  regulator of TGF-beta signaling. It shares phenotypic overlap with Marfan and
  Loeys-Dietz syndromes but is distinguished by craniosynostosis and intellectual
  disability. Features include Marfanoid habitus, skeletal anomalies, craniosynostosis,
  and arachnodactyly, with less severe cardiovascular involvement than LDS.

      Using family-based exome sequencing, we identified a dominantly inherited
      heterozygous in-frame deletion in exon 1 of SKI.
    explanation: >-
      Demonstrates dominant inheritance of SKI mutations in SGS.
pathophysiology:
- name: Enhanced TGF-beta Signaling
  description: >
    SKI is a transcriptional co-repressor that normally inhibits TGF-beta signaling
    by binding to SMAD proteins and recruiting transcriptional repression complexes.
    Loss-of-function mutations in SKI lead to enhanced TGF-beta signaling, similar
    to the paradoxical TGF-beta hyperactivation seen in Loeys-Dietz and Marfan
    syndromes. This drives abnormal connective tissue development.

      the mechanism underlying SGS and that high signaling contributes to
      multiple syndromic presentations of aortic aneurysm.

  description: >
    Enhanced TGF-beta signaling disrupts normal skeletal patterning and growth,
    leading to dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, scoliosis, and joint
    contractures similar to Marfan syndrome. Craniosynostosis results from
    premature fusion of cranial sutures.
