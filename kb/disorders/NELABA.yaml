name: Neonatal Severe Encephalopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Brain Abnormalities
category: Mendelian
description: >
  NELABA (Encephalopathy, Neonatal Severe, with Lactic Acidosis and Brain
  Abnormalities; OMIM 617668) is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive mitochondrial
  disorder caused by biallelic mutations in LIPT2, encoding lipoyltransferase 2.
  LIPT2 catalyzes the first committed step in the mitochondrial lipoylation
  pathway, transferring octanoyl groups from acyl carrier protein to the glycine
  cleavage system H protein (GCSH). Loss of function impairs lipoylation of all
  lipoic acid-dependent enzyme complexes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, and the glycine cleavage
  system. This causes congenital lactic acidosis, hyperglycinemia, severe
  encephalopathy with minimal psychomotor development, and progressive brain
  abnormalities including cortical atrophy, cysts, white matter abnormalities, and
  cortical malformations. Onset is at birth with hypotonia and respiratory
  insufficiency. Only four cases have been reported. Prognosis is poor; lipoic acid
  supplementation is ineffective.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Impaired mitochondrial lipoylation via LIPT2 deficiency
    description: >
      LIPT2 encodes lipoyltransferase 2, which transfers octanoyl groups from
      octanoyl-ACP (synthesized by the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis system) to
      the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH). This is the first committed step
      in the mitochondrial lipoylation pathway. The octanoyl-GCSH is then converted
      to lipoyl-GCSH by lipoic acid synthetase (LIAS), and LIPT1 relays lipoyl
      groups from GCSH to the E2 subunits of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenases.
      Loss-of-function mutations in LIPT2 abolish this initial transfer, leading
      to deficient lipoylation of all lipoic acid-dependent enzyme complexes and
      disruption of the glycine cleavage system. Unlike LIPT1 deficiency which
      spares glycine cleavage, LIPT2 deficiency affects all lipoylated proteins.

      Defective lipoylation of the E2 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHc),
      alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDHc), and branched-chain ketoacid
      dehydrogenase (BCKDHc) impairs oxidative metabolism of pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate,
      and branched-chain amino acids. Loss of PDHc blocks entry of glycolytic end
      products into the TCA cycle, causing pyruvate and lactate accumulation and
      energy failure. Loss of alpha-KGDHc disrupts the TCA cycle at its midpoint.
      The brain is particularly vulnerable due to its high dependence on oxidative
      metabolism.
