name: Bardet-Biedl Syndrome
description: Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy characterized
  by rod-cone dystrophy leading to blindness, obesity, polydactyly, renal anomalies,
  learning difficulties, and hypogonadism. It results from mutations in genes encoding
  components of the BBSome, a protein complex essential for ciliary trafficking.

    snippet: This study reports variants in BBS1 and BBS7 in patients with Bardet-Biedl
      syndrome from the Canadian Maritime provinces. The BBS1 variant NM_024649.5:c.1169T>G
      was identified as a recurrent variant in Prince Edward Island.
    explanation: This supports the claim that mutations in the BBS1 gene are a common
      subtype of Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
  - reference: PMID:32759308
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: More than half of BBS patients carry mutations in one of eight genes
      encoding for subunits of a protein complex, the BBSome, which mediates trafficking
      of ciliary cargoes. ... We show that the pre-BBSome is nucleated by BBS4 and
      assembled at pericentriolar satellites, followed by the translocation of the
      BBSome into the ciliary base mediated by BBS1.
    explanation: This explains the critical role of BBS1 in the assembly of the BBSome,
      further implicating it in Bardet-Biedl syndrome.

      (c.209G>A; p.Ser70Asn). Her clinical findings included global developmental

  description: The BBSome is an octameric protein complex (BBS1/2/4/5/7/8/9/BBIP1)
    whose assembly requires chaperonin-like proteins (BBS6, BBS10, BBS12). The BBSome
    cooperates with intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery to regulate ciliary
    entry, retention, and retrieval of membrane proteins including GPCRs. Disruption
    of BBSome-mediated trafficking causes mislocalization of ciliary cargos and impaired
    ciliary signaling across multiple tissues.
