description: 'Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBDD) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of valine catabolism
  caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in ACAD8. The enzyme isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of isobutyryl-CoA
  to methacrylyl-CoA within the mitochondrial valine degradation pathway. IBDD is most commonly identified through newborn
  screening by elevation of C4-acylcarnitine in dried blood spots. The estimated incidence is approximately 1:62,599 based
  on a Chinese newborn screening cohort. Most affected individuals remain clinically asymptomatic, and the condition is often
  regarded as a biochemical phenotype with limited clinical penetrance. In a comprehensive 172-case literature synthesis,
  146 individuals (85%) were asymptomatic. A minority of patients develop heterogeneous findings including anemia, transient
  developmental delay, hepatic transaminase elevations, or rarely cardiomyopathy. Enzyme redundancy and substrate promiscuity
  among acyl-CoA dehydrogenases may partially explain the low clinical penetrance observed in many individuals. Long-term
  prognosis is generally favorable, with most NBS-identified patients remaining healthy through childhood.

  description: 'Given the uncertain clinical significance of IBDD, most patients identified through newborn screening are
    managed with conservative monitoring. Regular clinical assessment with attention to growth, development, and metabolic
    status is recommended. In many cases, no specific intervention is required.

    episodes during intercurrent illness, although its necessity in IBDD remains uncertain.

  description: 'IBDD is detectable through expanded newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) via elevated
    C4-acylcarnitine. A diagnostic follow-up algorithm involving plasma and urine acylcarnitine profiling, urinary organic
    acid analysis, and molecular genetic testing of ACAD8 has been developed for confirmatory diagnosis.

  description: 'Novel C4-based acylcarnitine ratios have been proposed to reduce false positive rates in newborn screening
    and to improve discrimination between IBDD and SCADD. Seven ratios including C4/C0, C4/C5, C4/C6, and C4/C8 showed robust

    snippet: the application of second-tier tests before the release of neonatal screening results reduced referrals by over
      91.89% and improved the positive predictive value (PPV) for short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency/isobutyryl-CoA
      dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD/IBDD) screening.
    explanation: Demonstrates that second-tier testing greatly reduces unnecessary referrals.
notes: 'IBDD is frequently considered a biochemical phenotype rather than a true disease. The clinical significance remains
  debated, as highlighted by the question posed in a 2026 review entitled "Isobutyryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency:
  disease, or non-disease?" The major practical challenge is not detection but rather managing the high false-positive burden
  from non-specific C4-acylcarnitine elevation shared with SCADD. Combined NGS and MS/MS first-tier screening approaches have
  been shown to substantially improve positive predictive value. The ACAD8-deficient mouse model, which develops progressive
  hepatic steatosis and abnormal mitochondria, suggests that long-term hepatic monitoring may be warranted even in apparently
  asymptomatic individuals.
