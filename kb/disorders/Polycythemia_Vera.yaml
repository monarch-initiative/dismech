description: >-
  Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by
  uncontrolled erythrocyte production leading to elevated red blood cell mass,
  often accompanied by increased white blood cells and platelets. The JAK2 V617F
  mutation is present in approximately 95% of PV cases, with JAK2 exon 12 mutations
  accounting for most remaining cases. This mutation causes constitutive activation
  of JAK-STAT signaling, driving erythropoietin-independent erythroid proliferation.
  PV carries increased risk of thrombosis, the major cause of morbidity and mortality,
  and can progress to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib
  provides targeted therapy for inadequately controlled PV.

pathophysiology:
- name: JAK2 V617F Constitutive Activation
  description: >-
    The JAK2 V617F mutation in the pseudokinase domain eliminates auto-inhibition,
    causing constitutive JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity. This renders erythroid
    progenitors hypersensitive to or independent of erythropoietin, driving
    uncontrolled red blood cell production.

- name: STAT5 Hyperactivation
  description: >-
    Constitutive JAK2 activation leads to sustained STAT5 phosphorylation and
    transcriptional activation of genes promoting erythroid proliferation and
    survival, including BCL-XL and cyclin D1.

    term:

      label: JAK-STAT cascade
- name: Erythropoietin-Independent Erythropoiesis
  description: >-
    JAK2 V617F-mutant erythroid progenitors can proliferate and differentiate
    in the absence of erythropoietin, forming endogenous erythroid colonies (EEC)
    in culture. This erythropoietin independence is a diagnostic hallmark of PV.

    term:

      label: erythrocyte differentiation
- name: Hyperviscosity and Thrombosis Risk
  description: >-
    Elevated red blood cell mass increases blood viscosity and promotes
    thrombosis. The prothrombotic state is multifactorial, including abnormal
    red cell interactions, platelet activation, and endothelial dysfunction.

    Erythropoietin (EPO) level is characteristically low or low-normal in PV
    due to negative feedback from elevated red cell mass. Low EPO helps distinguish
    PV from secondary erythrocytosis.

    in approximately 95% of cases. Variant allele frequency may correlate with
    disease burden.

  notes: >-
