  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:37495957
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), the neurophysiological correlate of the migraine aura, can activate trigeminal pain pathways, but the neurobiological mechanisms and behavioural consequences remain unclear."
    explanation: Establishes CSD as the neurophysiological basis of migraine aura and its role in activating trigeminal pain pathways.
  - reference: PMID:37495957
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In both WT and FHM1 mutant mice, CSDs induced headache-related behaviour, as evidenced by increased MGS scores and the occurrence of oculotemporal strokes, at 30 min."
    explanation: Demonstrates that CSDs directly induce headache-related behaviors in animal models, supporting CSD's role in headache initiation.
  - reference: PMID:37495957
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Blocking Panx1 channels by TAT-Panx308 inhibited CSD-induced headache related behaviour and HMGB1 release."
    explanation: Shows that pannexin-1 channels mediate CSD-induced neuroinflammatory signaling and headache behaviors, identifying a key mechanism linking CSD to pain.
  - reference: PMID:39080518
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Neuronal pannexin-1 channels act as stress sensors, initiating the inflammatory signaling by inflammasome formation and high-mobility group box-1 release in response to transient perturbations such as cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)"
    explanation: Explains the molecular mechanism by which CSD triggers neuroinflammation through pannexin-1 channels and HMGB1 release.
- name: Trigeminovascular Activation
  description: >
    Activation of trigeminal nerve fibers innervating meningeal blood
    vessels releases CGRP and other neuropeptides, causing neurogenic
    inflammation and pain.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Pain Signaling
    term:
      id: GO:0048265
      label: response to pain
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:37487740
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "CSD is also thought to drive the headache phase in migraine by promoting the activation and mechanical sensitization of trigeminal primary afferent nociceptive neurons that innervate the cranial meninges."
    explanation: Confirms that CSD drives trigeminovascular activation leading to headache phase in migraine.
  - reference: PMID:39080518
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Studies in rodents have demonstrated that sterile meningeal inflammation can stimulate and sensitize meningeal nociceptors, culminating in headaches."
    explanation: Shows that meningeal inflammation activates and sensitizes trigeminal nociceptors, producing headache.
  - reference: PMID:39080518
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The parenchymal neuroinflammatory signaling involving neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, which eventually extends to the meninges, can link non-homeostatic perturbations in the insensate brain to pain-sensitive meninges."
    explanation: Describes the pathway by which brain parenchymal inflammation extends to activate pain-sensitive meningeal structures and trigeminal afferents.
- name: Central Sensitization
  description: >
    Repeated activation leads to sensitization of trigeminal nucleus
    and thalamic neurons, producing allodynia and enhanced pain
    perception.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:37487740
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Broad-spectrum P2X receptor inhibition, selective blockade of the P2X7 receptor, and its related Pannexin 1 channel suppressed CSD-evoked afferent mechanical sensitization but did not affect the accompanying afferent activation response."
    explanation: Demonstrates that P2X7 and Pannexin 1 signaling specifically mediate mechanical sensitization (allodynia) of meningeal afferents, a key component of central sensitization.
  - reference: PMID:37487740
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "We propose that meningeal P2X7 and Pannexin 1 signaling, potentially in meningeal macrophages or neutrophils, mediates the mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents, which contributes to migraine pain by exacerbating the headache during normally innocuous physical activities."
    explanation: Explains how sensitization leads to allodynia where normally innocuous stimuli become painful during migraine attacks.
- name: CGRP Pathway
  description: >
    Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release from trigeminal
    neurons causes vasodilation and neurogenic inflammation. CGRP
    blockers are effective treatments.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:39080518
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The efficacy of relatively blood-brain barrier-impermeable anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies and triptans in treating migraine attacks, both with and without aura, supports the concept of migraine pain originating in meninges."
    explanation: Clinical efficacy of CGRP-targeting therapies validates the central role of the CGRP pathway in migraine pathophysiology.
  - reference: PMID:37569648
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "However, the progresses in unravelling the migraine pathophysiology allowed identifying novel putative targets as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)."
    explanation: Identifies CGRP as a key validated target in migraine treatment based on understanding of disease pathophysiology.
  - reference: PMID:37569648
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Nevertheless, despite the revolution brought by CGRP monoclonal antibodies and gepants, a significant percentage of patients still remains burdened by an unsatisfactory response, suggesting that other pathways may play a critical role"
    explanation: Notes that while CGRP pathway is important, treatment resistance in some patients indicates involvement of additional pathways beyond CGRP.

    snippet: "After a single CSD, astrocytes respond by upregulating the transcription of proinflammatory enzymes and mediators, while microglia are involved in restoring neuronal structural integrity; however, repeated CSDs may prompt microglia to adopt a pro-inflammatory state."
    explanation: Neuroinflammatory responses to CSD contribute to the full range of migraine symptoms including autonomic features like nausea through central nervous system activation.
