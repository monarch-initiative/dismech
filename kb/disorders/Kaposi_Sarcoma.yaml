name: Kaposi Sarcoma
description: >-
  Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm caused by Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8),
  also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The tumor arises from
  infected endothelial cells that acquire a spindle cell morphology. Four clinical
  variants exist: classic (Mediterranean), endemic (African), iatrogenic (transplant-
  associated), and epidemic (AIDS-associated). HHV-8 viral oncoproteins including
  vGPCR, vFLIP, vCyclin, and LANA drive oncogenesis through activation of NF-kappaB,
  PI3K-AKT, and MAPK signaling pathways. The disease is characterized by multifocal
  red-purple vascular lesions of skin and viscera.

has_subtypes:
- name: Classic Kaposi Sarcoma
  description: >-
    Indolent form occurring in elderly men of Mediterranean, Eastern European,
    or Middle Eastern descent. Typically confined to lower extremities with
    slow progression over years to decades. Not associated with immunosuppression.
- name: Endemic Kaposi Sarcoma
  description: >-
    Occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, predating the HIV epidemic. Includes a
    lymphadenopathic variant affecting children that is rapidly progressive
    and often fatal. More aggressive than classic form.
- name: Iatrogenic Kaposi Sarcoma
  description: >-
    Occurs in organ transplant recipients and others on immunosuppressive
    therapy. May regress with reduction of immunosuppression. Risk correlates
    with degree of T-cell immunosuppression.
- name: AIDS-Associated Kaposi Sarcoma
  description: >-
    Most common malignancy in AIDS patients, particularly in men who have
    sex with men. More aggressive with visceral involvement. Incidence has
    declined dramatically with effective antiretroviral therapy but remains
    an AIDS-defining illness.

  description: >-
    HHV-8 (KSHV) is the causative agent of all forms of Kaposi sarcoma. The virus
    encodes multiple oncoproteins that drive transformation: vGPCR (viral G protein-
    coupled receptor) activates angiogenic signaling; vFLIP activates NF-kappaB
    for cell survival; vCyclin drives cell cycle progression; LANA maintains viral
    latency and inhibits p53 and Rb tumor suppressors. The virus establishes latent
    infection in endothelial cells, with lytic reactivation contributing to
    paracrine signaling and tumor progression.

    explanation: "Confirms HHV-8/KSHV as the etiologic agent of Kaposi sarcoma."
pathophysiology:
- name: HHV-8 Latent Infection of Endothelial Cells
  description: >-
    HHV-8 infects endothelial cells and establishes latent infection with expression
    of latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), vFLIP, and vCyclin. LANA maintains
    the viral episome and inhibits p53 and Rb tumor suppressor function. Latently
    infected cells undergo spindle cell transformation characteristic of KS.

    Viral FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP) constitutively activates NF-kappaB
    signaling by interacting with IKK complex. This promotes cell survival,
