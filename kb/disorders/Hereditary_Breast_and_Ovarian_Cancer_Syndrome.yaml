description: >-
  Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) is an autosomal dominant
  hereditary cancer syndrome caused by germline pathogenic variants in the BRCA1
  or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes. It is characterized by significantly elevated
  lifetime risks of breast cancer (up to 70-80%) and ovarian cancer (up to 40-50%),
  as well as increased risks of pancreatic, prostate, and other cancers. HBOC
  exemplifies the role of DNA double-strand break repair deficiency in tumorigenesis
  and the therapeutic exploitation of homologous recombination deficiency through
  PARP inhibitor synthetic lethality.

has_subtypes:
- name: BRCA1-Associated HBOC
  description: >-
    Associated with germline BRCA1 mutations. Higher lifetime risk of breast cancer
    (70-80%) and ovarian cancer (40-50%). Breast cancers often triple-negative
    (ER-/PR-/HER2-) and high grade. Higher risk of ovarian cancer than BRCA2.
- name: BRCA2-Associated HBOC
  description: >-
    Associated with germline BRCA2 mutations. Significant lifetime risk of breast
    cancer (60-70%) and ovarian cancer (15-30%). Higher risk of male breast cancer
    and pancreatic cancer than BRCA1. Also associated with increased prostate
    cancer risk.
pathophysiology:
- name: BRCA1/2 Tumor Suppressor Loss
  description: >-
    Germline heterozygous BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations result in one functional allele.
    Somatic loss or mutation of the remaining wild-type allele (second hit) eliminates
    BRCA function, initiating tumorigenesis. This follows Knudson's two-hit hypothesis
    for tumor suppressor gene inactivation.

- name: Homologous Recombination Deficiency
  description: >-
    BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential components of the homologous recombination (HR)
    pathway for error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Loss of BRCA function
    forces cells to rely on error-prone repair pathways such as non-homologous end
    joining, leading to genomic instability.

    snippet: >-
      BRCA1 is a pleiotropic DDR protein that functions in both checkpoint activation
      and DNA repair, whereas BRCA2 is a mediator of the core mechanism of homologous
      recombination. The links between the two proteins are not well understood, but
      they must exist to explain the marked similarity of human cancer susceptibility
      that arises with germline mutations in these genes.
    explanation: >-
      Review distinguishes BRCA1 and BRCA2 roles in DNA damage response and homologous
      recombination repair.
- name: Genomic Instability
  description: >-
    Loss of HR-mediated repair leads to accumulation of chromosomal aberrations,
    large-scale genomic rearrangements, and copy number alterations. This pattern
    of genomic instability, termed 'BRCAness' or homologous recombination deficiency
    (HRD), is characteristic of BRCA-deficient tumors and creates therapeutic
    vulnerability to PARP inhibitors.

    Progressive accumulation of genomic alterations in BRCA-deficient cells leads

    may relate to estrogen exposure and proliferative demands on these tissues,
    though the precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood.

biochemical:
- name: BRCA1/2 Genetic Testing
  notes: >-
    Comprehensive sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 identifies pathogenic variants
    including frameshift, nonsense, splice site, and missense mutations, as well
    as large deletions/duplications. Founder mutations exist in certain populations
    (Ashkenazi Jewish: 185delAG, 5382insC in BRCA1; 6174delT in BRCA2). Variants
    of uncertain significance require careful interpretation.
- name: Homologous Recombination Deficiency Testing
  notes: >-
    Tumor testing for HRD status includes genomic scar assays measuring loss of
    heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance, and large-scale state transitions.
    HRD-positive tumors may respond to PARP inhibitors even without germline BRCA
    mutations.
genetic:
- name: BRCA1
  association: Germline Loss-of-Function Mutations
  inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
  notes: >-
    BRCA1 (17q21.31) encodes a protein essential for DNA double-strand break repair
    by homologous recombination. It functions in the RAD51-mediated strand invasion
    step and also has roles in cell cycle checkpoint activation. Mutations include
    truncating variants, large deletions, and pathogenic missense mutations. Founder
    mutations are common in Ashkenazi Jewish (185delAG, 5382insC), Icelandic,
    and other populations.

  notes: >-
    BRCA2 (13q13.1) encodes a protein that facilitates RAD51 loading onto single-
    stranded DNA at sites of DNA double-strand breaks, enabling homologous
    recombination repair. Also known as FANCD1 as biallelic mutations cause Fanconi
    anemia. Founder mutations include 6174delT in Ashkenazi Jewish and 999del5 in
    Icelandic populations.
treatments:
- name: Risk-Reducing Mastectomy

    Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy reduces breast cancer risk by approximately
    90% in BRCA mutation carriers. Timing and decision require careful counseling
    about risks, benefits, reconstruction options, and psychological impact.

  description: >-
    Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy recommended after completion of childbearing
    (typically age 35-40 for BRCA1, 40-45 for BRCA2). Reduces ovarian cancer risk
    by 80-90% and breast cancer risk by approximately 50% when performed premenopausally.

    PARP inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, talazoparib) exploit synthetic
    lethality in BRCA-deficient tumors. PARP inhibition blocks single-strand break
    repair, causing double-strand breaks that cannot be repaired in HR-deficient
    cells. Approved for breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers with
    BRCA mutations.

    For women who do not undergo prophylactic surgery, enhanced surveillance includes
    annual breast MRI (starting age 25-30), mammography (starting age 30), and
    clinical breast exam. No proven effective ovarian cancer screening exists.
    Consider transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125, though sensitivity is limited.
