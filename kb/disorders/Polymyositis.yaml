    label: polymyositis
description: >-
  An idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterized by symmetric proximal muscle
  weakness without the skin manifestations of dermatomyositis. CD8+ T cell-mediated
  attack on muscle fibers is the primary pathogenic mechanism.
pathophysiology:
- name: CD8+ T Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity
  description: >-
    Clonally expanded CD8+ cytotoxic T cells infiltrate muscle fibers and
    directly attack myocytes expressing MHC class I. Perforin and granzyme
    release leads to muscle fiber necrosis.

      label: T cell mediated cytotoxicity
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:31257434
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The hallmark histopathology of PM is the presence of CD8+ T cells in the non-necrotic muscle cells."
    explanation: Demonstrates that CD8+ T cell invasion into muscle fibers is the defining pathological feature of polymyositis.
  - reference: PMID:31257434
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "CD8+ T cells invade into muscle cells and contribute to muscle injury in PM."
    explanation: Confirms the direct cytotoxic role of CD8+ T cells in causing muscle fiber damage through invasion and attack.
- name: Aberrant MHC Class I Expression
  description: >-
    Muscle fibers, which normally do not express MHC class I, show aberrant
    upregulation making them targets for CD8+ T cell recognition and attack.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: MHC Class I Antigen Presentation
    term:
      id: GO:0002474
      label: antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:15934115
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Up-regulation of class I MHC in skeletal muscle fibers was an early and consistent feature of human inflammatory myopathies."
    explanation: Demonstrates that MHC class I upregulation is a hallmark feature of polymyositis pathogenesis.
  - reference: PMID:15934115
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Class I MHC staining in muscle fibers of myositis patients showed both cell surface and a reticular pattern of internal reactivity."
    explanation: Shows that aberrant MHC I expression occurs both on the sarcolemma and within the endoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers.
- name: Myositis-Specific Autoantibodies
  description: >-
    Anti-synthetase antibodies (anti-Jo-1, anti-PL-7, anti-PL-12) define
    antisynthetase syndrome with myositis, ILD, and arthritis. Anti-SRP
    antibodies associate with necrotizing myopathy.

  - preferred_term: Immunoglobulin Production
    term:
      id: GO:0002377
      label: immunoglobulin production
- name: Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Production
  description: >-
    IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma produced by infiltrating immune cells
    perpetuate muscle inflammation and contribute to muscle weakness
    independent of direct fiber destruction.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Inflammatory Response
    term:
      id: GO:0006954
      label: inflammatory response
- name: ER Stress and Unfolded Protein Response
  description: >-
    Overexpression of MHC class I in muscle fibers triggers endoplasmic reticulum
    stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This includes
    upregulation of GRP78/BiP and NF-kappaB pathway activation, contributing to
    muscle fiber dysfunction independent of immune-mediated damage.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response
    term:
      id: GO:0034976
      label: response to endoplasmic reticulum stress
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:15934115
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The pathways of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, the unfolded protein response (glucose-regulated protein 78 pathway), and the ER overload response (NF-kappaB pathway) were significantly activated in muscle tissue of human myositis patients and in the mouse model."
    explanation: Demonstrates that ER stress pathways are activated in polymyositis muscle tissue as a consequence of MHC I overexpression.
  - reference: PMID:15934115
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "These results indicate that the ER stress response may be a major nonimmune mechanism responsible for skeletal muscle damage and dysfunction in autoimmune myositis."
    explanation: Identifies ER stress as a non-immune mechanism contributing to muscle pathology, explaining why inflammation doesn't always correlate with disease severity.
- name: Necroptosis and DAMP Release
  description: >-
    Muscle fibers undergo necroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, releasing
    damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including HMGB1. This amplifies
    inflammation and contributes to persistent muscle weakness even after initial
    immune attack.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Necroptotic Process
    term:
      id: GO:0070266
      label: necroptotic process
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:37483632
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Recent studies have revealed that muscle fibers of IIMs undergo necroptosis, a newly recognized form of regulated cell death, and promote muscle inflammation and dysfunction through releasing inflammatory mediators such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)."
    explanation: Establishes necroptosis as a key mechanism of muscle fiber death in polymyositis that perpetuates inflammation.
  - reference: PMID:37483632
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The research on murine model of polymyositis, a subtype of IIM, revealed that the inhibition of necroptosis or HMGB1, one of major DAMPs released from muscle fibers undergoing necroptosis, ameliorated muscle inflammation and recovered muscle weakness."
    explanation: Demonstrates that blocking necroptosis or DAMP signaling improves both inflammation and muscle function, highlighting therapeutic potential.
- name: Apoptosis of Muscle Fibers
  description: >-
    Apoptotic cell death occurs in muscle fibers surrounding those undergoing
    partial invasion by CD8+ T cells. Fibers with apoptotic nuclei are surrounded
    by CD8+ T cells, granzyme B-positive cells, and macrophages, suggesting
    cytotoxic T cell-mediated apoptosis occurs in parallel to direct invasion.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Apoptotic Process
    term:
      id: GO:0006915
      label: apoptotic process
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:32936839
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Apoptotic myonuclei were found in muscle with partial invasion, but not in the invaded fibres. Fibres with TUNEL positive nuclei were surrounded by CD8+ T-cells, granzyme B+ cells and macrophages, but lacked FAS receptor expression."
    explanation: Shows that apoptosis occurs in polymyositis muscle fibers adjacent to those with CD8+ T cell invasion, mediated by cytotoxic mechanisms.
  - reference: PMID:32936839
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The findings confirm that apoptosis occurs in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and support that it is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T- cells, acting in parallel to the process of partial invasion."
    explanation: Establishes that CD8+ T cell-mediated apoptosis is a distinct pathway of muscle damage occurring alongside direct fiber invasion.
