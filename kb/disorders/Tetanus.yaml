infectious_agent:
  - name: Clostridium tetani
    description: >
      A gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic bacterium found in soil and
      animal feces. The bacterium produces tetanospasmin (tetanus toxin), one of the
      most potent toxins known, which causes the characteristic muscle spasms of tetanus.
pathophysiology:
  - name: Tetanus Toxin (Tetanospasmin) Action
    description: >
      Clostridium tetani produces tetanospasmin, a potent neurotoxin that is transported
      retrogradely along motor neurons to the spinal cord. The toxin blocks the release
      of inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA and glycine) from presynaptic terminals in
      the spinal cord, leading to unopposed muscle contraction and characteristic spasms.

        snippet: "Tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins cause the neuroparalytic syndromes of tetanus and botulism, respectively, by delivering inside different types of neurons, metalloproteases specifically cleaving the SNARE proteins that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters."
        explanation: "This review confirms the mechanism of tetanus toxin action through metalloprotease cleavage of SNARE proteins, blocking neurotransmitter release."

  - name: Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction
    description: >
      Tetanus toxin affects the autonomic nervous system, causing sympathetic overactivity
      that manifests as tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmias, and hyperthermia. This
      autonomic instability is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in severe tetanus.

  - name: Wound Colonization
    description: >
      Clostridium tetani spores are ubiquitous in soil and enter the body through wounds.
      In anaerobic conditions (deep puncture wounds, necrotic tissue), spores germinate
      and the vegetative bacteria produce toxin locally before it spreads systemically.
