      infiltrate, followed by subacute/chronic changes and luminal myofibroblastic
      proliferation that can cause coronary artery stenosis.
    explanation: The literature indicates that Kawasaki disease can lead to coronary

      active therapeutic intervention for fever in KD cases might decrease the incidence
      of CAA.

      snippet: Histologically, coronary arteritis begins 6-8 days after the onset of
        KD, and leads immediately to inflammation of all layers of the artery. The
        inflammation spreads completely around the artery; as a result, structural
        components of the artery undergo intense damage; the artery then begins to
        dilate.
