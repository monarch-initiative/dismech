description: HIDEA syndrome (Hypotonia, Hypoventilation, Impaired Intellectual
  Development, Dysautonomia, Epilepsy, and Eye Abnormalities) is a severe
  autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by biallelic
  loss-of-function variants in P4HTM, encoding the endoplasmic reticulum
  transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase P4H-TM. The enzyme localizes to the ER
  membrane with its catalytic domain in the ER lumen and contains a unique
  EF-hand domain suggesting calcium regulation of enzymatic activity. Loss of
  P4H-TM leads to dysregulated HIF-1 signaling and calcium dynamics in
  astrocytes, affecting gliotransmission and central respiratory control
  circuits.

- name: P4HTM Gene Loss-of-Function
  description: Biallelic loss-of-function variants in P4HTM result in loss of
    ER-resident transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. The enzyme contains
    an EF-hand domain that allows calcium-dependent regulation of its catalytic
    activity, linking the genetic defect to both HIF signaling and calcium
    homeostasis pathways.

    snippet: Biallelic loss-of-function P4HTM gene variants cause hypotonia,

      abnormalities (HIDEA).

      mutations cause HIDEA syndrome.
- name: Dysregulated Astrocyte Calcium Signaling
  description: P4H-TM is a regulator of calcium dynamics and gliotransmission in
    astrocytes via a HIF-1-dependent mechanism. Loss of P4H-TM impairs
    receptor-operated and store-operated calcium entry (ROCE/SOCE), reduces
    mitochondrial calcium uptake and ATP production, and attenuates
    gliotransmission.
