    label: autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura
description: >-
  An autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia due to
  autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production.
  Formerly known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). May be primary
  or secondary to infection, autoimmune disease, or malignancy.
pathophysiology:
- name: Antiplatelet Antibody Production
  description: >-
    Autoantibodies (primarily IgG) target platelet surface glycoproteins,
    especially GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX. Antibody-coated platelets are cleared
    by splenic macrophages through Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis.

      A better understanding of the underlying pathology has facilitated the
      development of a number of new targeted therapies (Bruton's tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors, neonatal Fc receptors, strategies targeting B and
      plasma cells, strategies targeting T cells, complement inhibitors, and
      newer TPO-RAs for improving megakaryopoiesis), which seem to be highly
      effective and well tolerated and result in a significant improvement in
      patients' quality of life.
    explanation: >-
      This review confirms that autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction is
      central to ITP pathogenesis, with therapeutic strategies targeting Fc
      receptors and B cells showing efficacy.
- name: Impaired Megakaryopoiesis
  description: >-
    Autoantibodies also target megakaryocytes, impairing platelet production.
    T cell-mediated megakaryocyte damage and cytokine effects further suppress
    thrombopoiesis.

    snippet: >-
      In vitro studies using ITP sera or monoclonal antibodies against platelet
      and megakaryocyte surface glycoproteins have shown an impairment of many
      steps of megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, such as megakaryocyte
      differentiation and maturation, migration from the osteoblastic to the
      vascular niche, adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, and proplatelet
      formation, resulting in impaired and ectopic platelet production in the
      bone marrow and diminished platelet release in the bloodstream.
    explanation: >-
      This study demonstrates that ITP autoantibodies directly impair multiple
      steps of megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production, contributing
      to thrombocytopenia beyond peripheral destruction.

      Moreover, cytotoxic T cells may target bone marrow megakaryocytes,
      resulting in megakaryocyte destruction.
    explanation: >-
      Evidence that cellular immunity, specifically cytotoxic T cells, can
      directly attack megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, providing a T
      cell-mediated mechanism for impaired platelet production.
- name: T Cell Dysregulation
  description: >-
    Th1/Th17 imbalance and reduced regulatory T cell function contribute to
    loss of tolerance. Cytotoxic T cells may directly kill platelets and
    megakaryocytes.

      Studies have shown that an imbalance between T helper 17 (Th17) and
      Regulatory T (Treg) cells differentiated from CD4+T-cells is a key factor
      influencing the development and pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia.
      Th17 cells promote the development of chronic inflammatory disorders and
      induce autoimmune diseases, whereas Treg cells regulate immune homeostasis
      and prevent autoimmune diseases.
    explanation: >-
      This review establishes that Th17/Treg imbalance is a key pathogenic
      factor in ITP, with Th17 cells promoting autoimmunity and Treg
      dysfunction leading to loss of tolerance.
- name: Complement Activation
  description: >-
    Classical complement pathway activation occurs in many ITP patients,
    with C3, C4, and C9 deposition on platelets. Complement activation
    enhances platelet opsonization and clearance. Elevated complement
    activation markers correlate with disease severity and platelet count.

      Statistical analyses showed that acute ITP patients had higher plasma
      levels of sC5b-9 and C1q than CR or PR patients (median = sC5b-9: 200
      versus 98 mg/dl, P-value < 0·001) (median C1q = 2·11 versus 1·00 mg/dl,
      P-value < 0·001). CR and PR ITP patients had sC5b-9 and C1q plasma levels
      comparable to those observed in healthy volunteers.
    explanation: >-
      This study demonstrates that complement activation markers (sC5b-9 and
      C1q) are significantly elevated in acute ITP patients compared to
      patients in remission, and that sC5b-9 levels inversely correlate with
      platelet count, supporting complement's role in ITP pathogenesis.

    snippet: >-
      The pathogenesis involves antibody production, cytokine release, T cell
      impairment, complement activation and clearance of platelets.
    explanation: >-
      This research explicitly identifies complement activation as one of the
      key pathogenic mechanisms in ITP alongside antibodies and T cell
      dysfunction.

      Although the pathogenesis of ITP is currently better known and its
      etiology has been extensively studied, up to 75% of adult patients with
      ITP may develop chronicity, which represents a significant burden on
      patients' quality of life. A major risk of ITP is bleeding, but knowledge
      on the exact relationship between the degree of thrombocytopenia and
      bleeding symptoms, especially at a lower platelet count, is lacking.
    explanation: >-
      This review highlights that thrombocytopenia is the cardinal feature of
      ITP, with up to 75% of adult patients developing chronic thrombocytopenia,
      and bleeding risk correlates with platelet count severity.
