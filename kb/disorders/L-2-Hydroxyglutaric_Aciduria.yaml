description: 'L-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L2HGA) is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder caused by biallelic
  pathogenic variants in the L2HGDH gene, which encodes a mitochondrial FAD-dependent L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase.
  Loss of this metabolite-repair enzyme leads to systemic accumulation of L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG), particularly in the
  brain and cerebrospinal fluid. The disease follows a slowly progressive course characterized by psychomotor delay, intellectual
  disability, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and movement disorders. Brain MRI shows a distinctive pattern of subcortical white
  matter abnormalities with basal ganglia and dentate nuclei involvement. L2HGA patients also have an increased lifetime risk
  of central nervous system tumors. Treatment is primarily supportive with riboflavin and levocarnitine supplementation.

  notes: 'L2HGA is a rare disorder. Fewer than 300 cases have been reported worldwide. Higher prevalence is observed in populations
    with high consanguinity rates.

progression:
- phase: Onset
  age_range: Infancy-Early childhood
  notes: 'L2HGA typically presents in early childhood with developmental delay. Unlike many organic acidemias, L2HGA does
    not feature acute metabolic decompensation crises. Disease progression is insidious, with gradual neurological deterioration
    over years to decades including progressive cerebellar dysfunction, epilepsy, and movement disorders.

pathophysiology:
- name: L2HGDH deficiency and L-2-HG accumulation
  description: 'Loss of L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L2HGDH) activity impairs the metabolite-repair pathway that clears
    L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG), an aberrant off-pathway metabolite produced from alpha-ketoglutarate by L-malate dehydrogenase.
    L-2-HG accumulates in body fluids, particularly brain and CSF, at concentrations 10-300 times above normal.

    snippet: L-2-HGA patients have a significantly increased lifetime risk of central nervous system (CNS) tumors.
    explanation: Increased CNS tumor risk mandates ongoing neuroimaging surveillance.
notes: 'L2HGA is classified as a disorder of metabolite repair rather than a classic enzyme-deficiency organic acidemia. Unlike
  most organic acidemias, L2HGA does not feature acute metabolic decompensation episodes. The disease was first described
  in 1980 and the causative gene L2HGDH was identified in 2004. The relationship between chronic L-2-HG accumulation and brain
  tumorigenesis is an active area of investigation, with emerging evidence suggesting a two-hit oncogenesis model where L-2-HG
  elevation may prime tissue for tumor development but a secondary somatic mutation is required.
