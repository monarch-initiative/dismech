name: Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type IV
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Osteogenesis imperfecta type IV represents moderate severity OI, intermediate
  between the mild type I and severe type III. Caused by dominant-negative
  mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2, affected individuals have moderate bone fragility,
  variable short stature, normal or near-normal scleral hue (distinguishing it
  from type I), and may have dentinogenesis imperfecta. Phenotypic severity is
  highly variable, overlapping with both milder and more severe forms.

inheritance:

    description: >
      Autosomal dominant inheritance. Both inherited and de novo mutations occur.
      Variable expressivity is common even within families.
pathophysiology:
  - name: Moderate Collagen Structural Defect
    description: >
      Structural mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 that produce collagen with
      intermediate levels of dysfunction. The mutations allow more normal
      fibril formation than in types II/III but still compromise bone
      matrix integrity.

        snippet: >-
          The abnormal molecules are poorly secreted, more susceptible to degradation,
          and impair the formation of the extracellular matrix. The collagen fibres
          are abnormally organised and mineralisation is impaired.
        explanation: >-
          Describes the molecular consequences of collagen structural mutations that
          affect bone matrix formation, applicable across the OI severity spectrum.
genetic:
  - name: COL1A1/COL1A2 Mutations
    association: Causative
    notes: >
      Structural mutations including glycine substitutions and splice site
      mutations. Mutations in COL1A2 are more common in type IV than in
      type III, possibly explaining the milder phenotype given the
      2:1 ratio of alpha1 to alpha2 chains in type I collagen.

      - reference: PMID:7643358
        supports: SUPPORT
        evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
        snippet: >-
          The severity of the clinical phenotype appears to be related to the type of
          mutation, its location in the alpha chain, the surrounding amino acid
          sequences, and the level of expression of the mutant allele.
        explanation: >-
          Establishes that mutation type and location determine phenotypic severity,
          explaining the variable expressivity in moderate OI type IV.
