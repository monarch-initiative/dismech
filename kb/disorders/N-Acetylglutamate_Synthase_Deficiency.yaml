description: 'N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency is an extremely rare autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder caused
  by biallelic pathogenic variants in the NAGS gene. NAGS catalyzes the formation of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from acetyl-CoA
  and L-glutamate; NAG is the obligate allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the first enzyme of
  the urea cycle. Loss of NAGS activity leads to reduced NAG production, underactivation of CPS1, impaired ureagenesis, and
  consequent hyperammonemia. The disorder is clinically indistinguishable from CPS1 deficiency and requires molecular diagnosis.
  Incidence is estimated at less than one in 2,000,000 live births. Uniquely among urea cycle disorders, NAGS deficiency can
  be specifically treated with N-carbamyl-L-glutamate (carglumic acid), a stable NAG analogue that directly activates CPS1.

parents:
- Urea Cycle Disorder
- Inborn Error of Metabolism
prevalence:
- notes: Extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of less than one in 2,000,000 live births. NAGS deficiency represents
    approximately 0.5-1% of all urea cycle disorders.
progression:
- notes: Neonatal-onset presentation is most common (58% of reported cases present before one month of age), but later-onset
    forms occur across a broad age spectrum including adulthood. Acute hyperammonemic crises recur during catabolic stress,
    illness, or interruption of therapy. Without treatment, severe neonatal hyperammonemia can cause irreversible brain damage
    or death. With early diagnosis and carglumic acid therapy, long-term outcomes can be favorable.
pathophysiology:
- name: Deficient NAG production and loss of CPS1 activation
  description: 'NAGS catalyzes NAG formation from acetyl-CoA and L-glutamate in the mitochondrial matrix of hepatocytes and
    intestinal cells. NAG is the essential allosteric activator of CPS1; without NAG, CPS1 is inactive and the urea cycle
    cannot convert ammonia to carbamoyl phosphate. Loss of NAGS activity therefore abolishes urea cycle flux at its first
    and rate-limiting step, resulting in systemic hyperammonemia.

    agents during acute hyperammonemic crises. These drugs provide alternative nitrogen disposal pathways independent of the
    urea cycle.

    snippet: Since its recognition in 1981, NAGS deficiency has been treated with carbamylglutamate with or without other
      measures (nutritional, ammonia scavengers, dialytic, etc.).

    snippet: The acute management includes detoxification of ammonia, which often requires extracorporeal means such as haemodialysis,
      and the use of intravenous drugs that work as nitrogen scavengers.
    explanation: Supports the use of nitrogen scavengers in acute hyperammonemia management.
- name: Extracorporeal ammonia removal
  description: 'Hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) may be required for emergency ammonia removal
    during severe hyperammonemic crises, particularly when ammonia levels exceed 200 micromol/L or when pharmacological measures
    are insufficient.

    snippet: Treatment consists in adapted nutrition, scavenging agents and dialysis. As adults are more susceptible to hyperammonemia,
      emergent hemodialysis is mandatory before referral to a reference center if ammonia levels are above 200 µmol/l
    explanation: Establishes dialysis threshold and its role in acute UCD management.
- name: Supportive care during acute crises
  description: 'Emergency management of hyperammonemic crises includes cessation of protein intake, reversal of catabolism
    via high-calorie glucose infusion, correction of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, and intensive care monitoring.
    Plans for illness and medication access disruption should be established for all patients.

      access, including nutrition management strategies such as protein restriction.

    snippet: Long-term management of patients with UCDs consists of a low-protein diet, which needs to be balanced and supplemented
      to avoid deficiencies of essential amino acids, trace elements or vitamins and the use of nitrogen scavengers.
    explanation: Supports comprehensive supportive care for long-term management.
- name: Citrulline and arginine supplementation
  description: 'Supplementation with citrulline or arginine has been reported in some cases of NAGS deficiency to support
    urea cycle intermediate availability. Arginine is also a positive regulator of NAGS enzyme activity in patients with residual
    enzyme function.

- name: Genetic counseling
  description: 'Genetic counseling is essential for affected families given the autosomal recessive inheritance, recurrence
    risk of 25% for each subsequent pregnancy, and availability of carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis. Molecular confirmation
    is also critical because NAGS deficiency is clinically indistinguishable from CPS1 deficiency yet has fundamentally different

      therapy of CPS1D requires liver transplantation. Since their differentiation is done genetically, it is important to
      ascertain the disease-causing potential of CPS1 and NAGS genetic variants.

- name: Carbamylglutamate therapeutic trial
  description: 'A therapeutic trial of carbamylglutamate is recommended for any patient with unexplained hyperammonemia and
    a proximal urea cycle defect pattern, as it can serve both as a diagnostic tool and as definitive treatment for NAGS deficiency.

      to carbamylglutamate may also be helpful.
    explanation: Supports use of carbamylglutamate therapeutic trial for diagnosis and treatment.
notes: 'NAGS deficiency is phenotypically identical to CPS1 deficiency and lacks reliable differential biomarkers, making
  molecular diagnosis essential for targeted treatment decisions. Unlike CPS1 deficiency, which may require liver transplantation,
  NAGS deficiency can be cured by substitutive therapy with carglumic acid. Medication access interruptions (due to insurance
  authorization, language barriers, or caregiving limitations) are documented causes of preventable hyperammonemic decompensation.
  Newborn screening is unreliable for NAGS deficiency due to instability of glutamine markers and low specificity of reduced
  citrulline levels. A high index of suspicion is needed for late-onset presentations, which can manifest at any age with
  diverse symptoms including recurrent headaches, behavioral changes, and episodic encephalopathy.
