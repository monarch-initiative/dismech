has_subtypes:
- name: AQP4-IgG Seropositive NMOSD
  description: >
    The most common form, characterized by presence of antibodies against
    aquaporin-4 water channels on astrocytes. Associated with more severe
    attacks and higher relapse rates.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26092914
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      The new nomenclature defines the unifying term NMO spectrum disorders
      (NMOSD), which is stratified further by serologic testing (NMOSD with
      or without AQP4-IgG).
    explanation: >-
      The 2015 international diagnostic criteria formally stratify NMOSD
      by AQP4-IgG serostatus.
- name: MOG-IgG Associated Disease
  description: >
    Characterized by antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein.
    Now recognized as a distinct entity (MOGAD) separate from AQP4+ NMOSD.
- name: Seronegative NMOSD
  description: >
    Meets clinical criteria for NMOSD but lacks detectable AQP4 or MOG antibodies.
pathophysiology:
- name: Aquaporin-4 Autoimmunity
  description: >
    Anti-AQP4 (NMO-IgG) antibodies bind to aquaporin-4 water channels
    predominantly expressed on astrocyte end-feet at the blood-brain barrier.
    This initiates complement-dependent cytotoxicity leading to astrocyte death,
    secondary oligodendrocyte damage, demyelination, and neuronal injury.

  biological_processes:

    term:
      id: GO:0006956
      label: complement activation
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35454180
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      In NMOSD, the autoantibody (NMO-IgG) binds to the extracellular loops
      of AQP4 as expressed in perivascular astrocytic end-feet and disrupts
      astrocytes in a complement-dependent manner.
    explanation: >-
      This review confirms that NMO-IgG binds AQP4 on astrocyte end-feet and
      causes complement-dependent astrocyte destruction.
- name: Complement-Mediated Astrocyte Destruction
  description: >
    AQP4-IgG binding activates the classical complement cascade, leading to
    membrane attack complex formation and astrocyte lysis. This distinguishes
    NMOSD from MS where complement activation is less prominent.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: complement activation, classical pathway
    term:
      id: GO:0006958
      label: complement activation, classical pathway
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:31050279
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      At least two thirds of cases are associated with aquaporin-4 antibodies
      (AQP4-IgG) and complement-mediated damage to the central nervous system.
    explanation: >-
      The PREVENT trial confirms that NMOSD involves complement-mediated CNS damage.
- name: Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption
  description: >
    Inflammatory infiltrates including neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages
    cross the disrupted blood-brain barrier. Granulocyte infiltration is a
    hallmark feature distinguishing NMOSD lesions from MS plaques.

      label: eosinophil
- name: Secondary Demyelination
  description: >
    Unlike MS where oligodendrocytes are primary targets, in NMOSD demyelination
    occurs secondary to astrocyte loss. Loss of astrocyte trophic support leads
    to oligodendrocyte death and myelin breakdown.

phenotypes:

      The core clinical characteristics required for patients with NMOSD with
      AQP4-IgG include clinical syndromes or MRI findings related to optic nerve,
      spinal cord, area postrema, other brainstem, diencephalic, or cerebral
      presentations.
    explanation: >-
      International diagnostic criteria identify optic nerve involvement as a
      core clinical characteristic of NMOSD.
- name: Longitudinally Extensive Transverse Myelitis
  description: >
    Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) affecting three or more
    vertebral segments is characteristic of NMOSD, distinguishing it from the
    shorter lesions typical of multiple sclerosis. Causes paraplegia, sensory
    loss, and bladder/bowel dysfunction. LETM is a core diagnostic criterion
    for NMOSD.

    Annotated with general HP:0012486 (Myelitis) as HPO lacks a specific term
    for longitudinally extensive myelitis. The spatial extent qualifier
    "longitudinally extensive" (≥3 vertebral segments) is documented in the

    support spatial extent qualifiers.

      Spinal cord involvement (transverse myelitis) is a core diagnostic criterion.
- name: Area Postrema Syndrome
  description: >
    Intractable nausea, vomiting, and hiccups due to inflammation of the
    area postrema (UBERON:0002162) in the dorsal medulla. A characteristic
    early manifestation that may precede other symptoms. This is a syndrome
    involving a specific anatomical location rather than a simple phenotype.

    Involvement of brainstem structures causing diplopia, facial weakness,
    dysphagia, and respiratory failure in severe cases.
  frequency: OCCASIONAL
- name: Diencephalic Syndrome

    Hypothalamic involvement causing narcolepsy-like symptoms, endocrine
    dysfunction, and syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion.
  frequency: OCCASIONAL
genetic:
- name: HLA-DRB1*03:01
  association: Associated
  notes: >
    Strong genetic association with HLA class II alleles, particularly
    HLA-DRB1*03:01, suggesting T cell involvement in disease initiation.
    This distinguishes NMOSD from MS which is associated with HLA-DRB1*15.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:33420337
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      Neuromyelitis Optica patients have 2.46 more chances of having the DRB1*03
      allelic group than controls. Ethnicity can influence genetic susceptibility.
      The main HLA association with Neuromyelitis Optica was the DRB1*03:01 allele
      in Western populations and with the DPB1*05:01 allele in Asia.
    explanation: >-
      Meta-analysis confirms HLA-DRB1*03:01 as the primary genetic risk factor
      for NMO in Western populations, distinct from MS associations.
