description: >-
  FGFR-altered urothelial carcinoma is a molecularly-defined subset of bladder and
  upper urinary tract cancers harboring activating alterations in fibroblast growth
  factor receptors, most commonly FGFR3. FGFR3 mutations occur in approximately 15-20%
  of advanced urothelial carcinomas and are enriched in luminal-papillary subtypes.
  FGFR3 fusions, including FGFR3-TACC3, occur in a smaller subset. These alterations
  drive constitutive receptor activation and downstream RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling.
  The identification of FGFR as an oncogenic driver led to development of erdafitinib,
  the first FDA-approved targeted therapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

has_subtypes:
- name: FGFR3-Mutant Urothelial Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Most common FGFR alteration type, with activating point mutations in FGFR3
    including S249C, Y373C, and R248C. These mutations cause constitutive receptor
    dimerization and activation.
- name: FGFR2/3-Fusion Positive Urothelial Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Gene fusions involving FGFR2 or FGFR3, most commonly FGFR3-TACC3, lead to
    constitutive kinase activation through dimerization mediated by the fusion partner.
pathophysiology:
- name: FGFR3 Constitutive Activation
  description: >-
    Activating mutations in FGFR3 cause ligand-independent receptor dimerization
    and autophosphorylation. The most common mutations affect cysteine residues in
    the extracellular domain, creating aberrant disulfide bonds that constitutively
    activate the receptor.

  - target: RAS-MAPK Pathway Activation
    description: FGFR3 phosphorylation activates RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade
  - target: PI3K-AKT Pathway Activation
    description: FGFR3 phosphorylation recruits PI3K leading to AKT activation
- name: RAS-MAPK Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    FGFR3 activation stimulates the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade through
    adaptor proteins FRS2 and GRB2. This drives uncontrolled urothelial cell
    proliferation and is a major effector of FGFR-mediated transformation.

    modifier: INCREASED
    term:
      id: GO:0000165
      label: MAPK cascade
- name: PI3K-AKT Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    FGFR3 activation recruits PI3K and activates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
    pathway, promoting urothelial cell survival and resistance to apoptosis.
