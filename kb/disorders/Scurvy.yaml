parents:
- Vitamin Deficiency Disease
pathophysiology:
- name: Collagen Synthesis Impairment
  description: >
    Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is essential for hydroxylation of proline and lysine
    residues in collagen synthesis by prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases. Deficiency leads
    to inadequate hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine formation, preventing triple-helix
    stability and mature cross-links, resulting in defective collagen formation that
    affects connective tissues throughout the body.

    description: Defective collagen formation impairs tissue repair and wound healing processes.
  - target: Gingival Bleeding

    explanation: "This abstract confirms scurvy affects multiple organ systems through its role in connective tissue synthesis, supporting the collagen synthesis impairment mechanism."
- name: Vascular Integrity Failure
  description: >
    Defective collagen in blood vessel walls and basement membranes leads to capillary
    fragility and increased vascular permeability. This manifests as spontaneous bleeding
    including petechiae, ecchymoses, and mucosal hemorrhages despite normal coagulation.

  description: >
    Inadequate dietary intake of vitamin C (ascorbic acid), typically less than 10 mg/day
    for several weeks to months. Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, berries, and
    green vegetables. Inadequate intake may result from poor dietary habits, low
    socio-economic status, restricted diets, or limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables.

notes: |
  Scurvy is a historically significant disease that affected sailors on long voyages
  before the discovery of vitamin C's role. It is now rare in developed countries but
  can occur in individuals with severely restricted diets, alcoholism, or malabsorption
  disorders. The disease is completely reversible with vitamin C replacement.
