description: >
  Thanatophoric dysplasia type 2 (TD2) is a severe, usually lethal skeletal dysplasia
  caused by the heterozygous FGFR3 K650E mutation. It is distinguished from TD1 by
  straight (rather than curved) femurs and a high frequency of cloverleaf skull
  (kleeblattschadel). Like TD1, it features extreme rhizomelic limb shortening, narrow
  thorax causing pulmonary hypoplasia, platyspondyly, and macrocephaly. Perinatal
  lethality is typical due to respiratory insufficiency, though rare long-term survivors
  have been reported with intensive support.

parents:
- FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia
- Lethal skeletal dysplasia
inheritance:
- name: Autosomal dominant (de novo)
  description: >
    Virtually all cases arise from de novo heterozygous mutations. The K650E mutation
    is highly recurrent at a CpG dinucleotide, explaining the consistent genotype
    in TD2.
pathophysiology:
- name: Severe FGFR3 gain-of-function (K650E)
  description: >
    The K650E mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain causes severe constitutive
    activation of FGFR3 through autophosphorylation, independent of ligand binding.
    This profoundly inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, resulting
    in minimal endochondral bone growth. The K650E mutation causes more severe receptor
    activation than the K650M mutation (associated with SADDAN syndrome).

  description: >
    The FGFR3 K650E mutation affects cranial suture development, leading to the
    cloverleaf skull deformity (kleeblattschadel) seen in many TD2 cases. This
    involves premature fusion of multiple cranial sutures with compensatory bulging
    at patent sutures.

    The c.1948A>G (p.Lys650Glu) mutation is the specific and consistent cause of TD2.
    This mutation occurs at a CpG dinucleotide hotspot, explaining its recurrence.
    Unlike TD1, which has multiple causative mutations, TD2 is genetically homogeneous.

notes: >
  TD2 is distinguished from TD1 by straight (rather than curved) femurs and frequent
  cloverleaf skull. Both types share severe limb shortening, narrow thorax, and
  perinatal lethality. The genotype-phenotype correlation is clear: TD2 is consistently
  caused by the K650E mutation in the kinase domain, while TD1 is caused by various
  mutations in the extracellular and transmembrane domains. The K650E mutation is at
  the same codon as the K650M mutation causing SADDAN syndrome, but K650E causes more
  severe receptor activation and a more severe phenotype.
