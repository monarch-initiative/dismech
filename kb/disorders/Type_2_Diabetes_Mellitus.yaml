pathophysiology:
- name: Insulin Resistance
  description: >
    Peripheral tissues (muscle, liver, adipose) become resistant to insulin action,
    requiring higher insulin levels to maintain glucose homeostasis. This leads to
    compensatory hyperinsulinemia and eventually beta cell exhaustion.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:12231074
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Insulin resistance is caused by the decreased ability of peripheral
      target tissues (especially muscle) to respond properly to normal circulating
      concentrations of insulin."
    explanation: This establishes that skeletal muscle is a key site of insulin
      resistance in type 2 diabetes, with impaired response to normal insulin
      levels.
  - reference: PMID:12231074
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "These alterations in glucose transport activity are likely the result
      of dysregulation of intramyocellular fatty acid metabolism, whereby fatty acids
      cause insulin resistance by activation of a serine kinase cascade, leading to
      decreased insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation
      and decreased IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, a required
      step in insulin-stimulated glucose transport into muscle."
    explanation: This describes the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance
      involving fatty acid-induced serine kinase activation that impairs insulin
      receptor signaling through IRS-1 and PI3K.
  - reference: PMID:29939616
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Insulin resistance impairs glucose disposal, resulting in a compensatory
      increase in beta-cell insulin production and hyperinsulinemia."
    explanation: This confirms that insulin resistance leads to compensatory
      hyperinsulinemia as beta cells attempt to overcome impaired glucose
      disposal in peripheral tissues.
- name: Beta Cell Dysfunction
  description: >
    Progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function and mass leads to inadequate
    insulin secretion relative to insulin demand. Beta cell failure is the key
    determinant of disease progression.

    snippet: "Insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction are major pathological
      mechanisms implicated in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes
      (T2D)."
    explanation: This establishes beta cell dysfunction as a core pathological
      mechanism in type 2 diabetes development alongside insulin resistance.
  - reference: PMID:37035220
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Predominant markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1β are consistently associated with β-cell
      failure in preclinical models and in people with T2D."
    explanation: This demonstrates that inflammatory markers are associated with
      beta cell failure, indicating inflammation contributes to beta cell
      dysfunction.
  - reference: PMID:37035220
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Similarly, important markers of oxidative stress, such as increased
      reactive oxygen species and depleted intracellular antioxidants, are consistent
      with pancreatic β-cell damage in conditions of T2D."
    explanation: This confirms that oxidative stress, characterized by increased
      ROS and depleted antioxidants, contributes to pancreatic beta cell damage
      in type 2 diabetes.
  - reference: PMID:29939616
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "This vicious cycle continues until pancreatic beta-cell activity can
      no longer adequately meet the insulin demand created by insulin resistance,
      resulting in hyperglycemia."
    explanation: This describes the progression from compensatory beta cell
      hyperfunction to beta cell exhaustion and failure, leading to
      hyperglycemia.
- name: Hepatic Glucose Overproduction
  description: >
    Impaired suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis leads to elevated fasting
    glucose levels. The liver fails to respond appropriately to insulin signals.

    snippet: "Diabetes is characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis partly due
      to abnormally elevated hepatic glucose production (HGP)."
    explanation: This establishes that elevated hepatic glucose production is a
      key feature of diabetes pathophysiology.
  - reference: PMID:30150719
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Metformin exerts its antihyperglycemic action primarily through lowering
      hepatic glucose production (HGP)."
    explanation: This confirms that hepatic glucose overproduction is central to
      diabetes hyperglycemia, as metformin's primary mechanism targets HGP
      suppression.
  - reference: PMID:30150719
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "FBP1 catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
      (F-1,6-P2) to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the
      presence of divalent cations. FBP1 is a key rate-controlling enzyme in the gluconeogenic
      pathway."
    explanation: This identifies fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) as a key
      rate-controlling enzyme in hepatic gluconeogenesis, the pathway
      responsible for glucose overproduction in diabetes.
- name: Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress
  description: >
    Early-onset mitochondrial dysfunction and pathological reactive oxygen species
    (ROS) generation occur across multiple metabolic tissues including pancreatic
    beta cells, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Impaired mitophagy and
    mitochondrial dynamics contribute to disease progression. Extracellular
    vesicle-mediated inter-organ miscommunication propagates oxidative damage.

    snippet: "New evidence suggests that T2D-lean individuals experience early β-cell
      dysfunction without significant IR. Regardless of the primary event (i.e., IR
      vs. β-cell dysfunction) that contributes to dysglycemia, significant early-onset
      oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple metabolic tissues
      may be a driver of T2D onset and progression."
    explanation: This establishes that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative
      damage occur early and may drive T2D progression regardless of whether
      insulin resistance or beta cell dysfunction is the primary event.
  - reference: PMID:38338783
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Physiological oxidative stress promotes inter-tissue communication,
      while pathological oxidative stress promotes inter-tissue mis-communication,
      and new evidence suggests that this is mediated via extracellular vesicles (EVs),
      including mitochondria containing EVs."
    explanation: This describes the novel mechanism of extracellular
      vesicle-mediated oxidative stress propagation between tissues in T2D
      pathogenesis.

    snippet: "Similarly, important markers of oxidative stress, such as increased

      ROS and depleted antioxidants contributes to beta cell damage.
- name: Incretin Axis Dysfunction
  description: >
    Impaired incretin hormone signaling, particularly blunted glucose-dependent
    insulinotropic peptide (GIP) action in beta cells. GLP-1 action is relatively
