    label: type 2 diabetes mellitus
pathophysiology:
- name: Insulin Resistance
  description: >
    Peripheral tissues (muscle, liver, adipose) become resistant to insulin action,
    requiring higher insulin levels to maintain glucose homeostasis. This leads to
    compensatory hyperinsulinemia and eventually beta cell exhaustion.

      label: insulin receptor signaling pathway
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:12231074
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Insulin resistance is caused by the decreased ability of peripheral target tissues (especially muscle) to respond properly to normal circulating concentrations of insulin."
    explanation: This establishes that skeletal muscle is a key site of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes, with impaired response to normal insulin levels.
  - reference: PMID:12231074
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "These alterations in glucose transport activity are likely the result of dysregulation of intramyocellular fatty acid metabolism, whereby fatty acids cause insulin resistance by activation of a serine kinase cascade, leading to decreased insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, a required step in insulin-stimulated glucose transport into muscle."
    explanation: This describes the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance involving fatty acid-induced serine kinase activation that impairs insulin receptor signaling through IRS-1 and PI3K.
  - reference: PMID:29939616
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Insulin resistance impairs glucose disposal, resulting in a compensatory increase in beta-cell insulin production and hyperinsulinemia."
    explanation: This confirms that insulin resistance leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia as beta cells attempt to overcome impaired glucose disposal in peripheral tissues.
- name: Beta Cell Dysfunction
  description: >
    Progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function and mass leads to inadequate
    insulin secretion relative to insulin demand. Beta cell failure is the key
    determinant of disease progression.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction are major pathological mechanisms implicated in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D)."
    explanation: This establishes beta cell dysfunction as a core pathological mechanism in type 2 diabetes development alongside insulin resistance.
  - reference: PMID:37035220
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Predominant markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1β are consistently associated with β-cell failure in preclinical models and in people with T2D."
    explanation: This demonstrates that inflammatory markers are associated with beta cell failure, indicating inflammation contributes to beta cell dysfunction.
  - reference: PMID:37035220
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Similarly, important markers of oxidative stress, such as increased reactive oxygen species and depleted intracellular antioxidants, are consistent with pancreatic β-cell damage in conditions of T2D."
    explanation: This confirms that oxidative stress, characterized by increased ROS and depleted antioxidants, contributes to pancreatic beta cell damage in type 2 diabetes.
  - reference: PMID:29939616
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "This vicious cycle continues until pancreatic beta-cell activity can no longer adequately meet the insulin demand created by insulin resistance, resulting in hyperglycemia."
    explanation: This describes the progression from compensatory beta cell hyperfunction to beta cell exhaustion and failure, leading to hyperglycemia.
- name: Hepatic Glucose Overproduction
  description: >
    Impaired suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis leads to elevated fasting
    glucose levels. The liver fails to respond appropriately to insulin signals.

  - preferred_term: Hepatocyte
    term:
      id: CL:0000182
      label: hepatocyte

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:30150719
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Diabetes is characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis partly due to abnormally elevated hepatic glucose production (HGP)."
    explanation: This establishes that elevated hepatic glucose production is a key feature of diabetes pathophysiology.
  - reference: PMID:30150719
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Metformin exerts its antihyperglycemic action primarily through lowering hepatic glucose production (HGP)."
    explanation: This confirms that hepatic glucose overproduction is central to diabetes hyperglycemia, as metformin's primary mechanism targets HGP suppression.
  - reference: PMID:30150719
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "FBP1 catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P2) to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the presence of divalent cations. FBP1 is a key rate-controlling enzyme in the gluconeogenic pathway."
    explanation: This identifies fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) as a key rate-controlling enzyme in hepatic gluconeogenesis, the pathway responsible for glucose overproduction in diabetes.
