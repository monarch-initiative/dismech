- name: Dopaminergic Neuron Loss
  description: >
    Progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra
    pars compacta leads to dopamine deficiency in the striatum, causing motor
    symptoms. Symptoms appear after 60-80% neuron loss.

    snippet: "Tremor, shaking, movement problems, and difficulty with balance and coordination are among the hallmarks, and dopaminergic neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain and aggregation of intracellular protein α-synuclein are the pathological characterizations."
    explanation: This review confirms that dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, supporting the core mechanism of dopaminergic neuron degeneration.
- name: Alpha-Synuclein Aggregation
  description: >
    Misfolded alpha-synuclein protein accumulates to form Lewy bodies and
    Lewy neurites. These aggregates spread through the nervous system in a
    prion-like manner, contributing to neurodegeneration.

    snippet: "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with the deposition of aggregated α-synuclein."
    explanation: This authoritative Lancet review establishes that aggregated α-synuclein deposition is a defining feature of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.
  - reference: PMID:38245249
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Biochemical studies, investigation of transplanted neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease, and cell and animal model studies suggest that abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein and spreading of pathology between the gut, brainstem, and higher brain regions probably underlie the development and progression of Parkinson's disease."
    explanation: This provides direct evidence for the prion-like spreading mechanism of α-synuclein pathology across neural networks, supporting the mechanism of trans-neuronal propagation.
  - reference: PMID:36598534
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and is characterized by accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn)."
    explanation: Confirms that α-synuclein accumulation is a key pathological characterization of PD, reinforcing the central role of protein aggregation in disease pathology.
- name: Mitochondrial Dysfunction
  description: >
    Impaired mitochondrial function, particularly complex I deficiency,
    leads to oxidative stress and neuronal death. Multiple PD genes
    (PINK1, Parkin, DJ-1) regulate mitochondrial quality control.

  - preferred_term: Mitochondrial Function

      id: GO:0007005
      label: mitochondrion organization
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38245249
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "At a cellular level, abnormal mitochondrial, lysosomal, and endosomal function can be identified in both monogenic and sporadic Parkinson's disease, suggesting multiple potential treatment approaches."
    explanation: This establishes that mitochondrial dysfunction is a common cellular feature across both genetic and sporadic forms of PD, supporting its central role in disease pathogenesis.
  - reference: PMID:25611507
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Biochemical and genetic studies reveal that the products of two genes that are mutated in autosomal recessive parkinsonism, PINK1 and Parkin, normally work together in the same pathway to govern mitochondrial quality control, bolstering previous evidence that mitochondrial damage is involved in Parkinson's disease."
    explanation: This directly supports the role of PINK1 and Parkin genes in mitochondrial quality control and confirms that mitochondrial damage is involved in PD pathogenesis.
  - reference: PMID:27911343
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "For the past 30 years, mitochondrial dysfunction has been hypothesized to play a central role in the pathobiology of this devastating neurodegenerative disease. The identifications of mutations in genes encoding PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1) and Parkin (E3 ubiquitin ligase) in familial PD and their functional association with mitochondrial quality control provided further support to this hypothesis."
    explanation: This review confirms the long-standing central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD and validates the connection between PINK1/Parkin mutations and mitochondrial quality control defects.
- name: Neuroinflammation
  description: >
    Activated microglia and astrocytes contribute to neurodegeneration
    through release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.

    snippet: "Recent work has also highlighted maladaptive immune and inflammatory responses, possibly triggered in the gut, that accelerate the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease."
    explanation: This establishes that maladaptive immune and inflammatory responses play an active role in accelerating PD pathogenesis, supporting the neuroinflammation mechanism.
  - reference: PMID:37048085
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Neuroinflammation has emerged as an involving mechanism at the initiation and development of PD. It is a complex network of interactions comprising immune and non-immune cells in addition to mediators of the immune response. Microglia, the resident macrophages in the CNS, take on the leading role in regulating neuroinflammation and maintaining homeostasis."
    explanation: This directly supports the role of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD initiation and progression, confirming the importance of microglial activation in disease pathology.
  - reference: PMID:36598534
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Neuroinflammation driven by microglia is an important pathological manifestation of PD. α-Syn is a crucial marker of PD, and its accumulation leads to microglia M1-like phenotype polarization, activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, and impaired autophagy and phagocytosis in microglia."
    explanation: This links α-synuclein accumulation to microglial activation and pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype polarization, supporting the mechanism by which neuroinflammation contributes to neurodegeneration in PD.
