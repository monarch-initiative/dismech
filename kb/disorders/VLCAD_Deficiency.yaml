description: 'Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of mitochondrial
  long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in ACADVL. VLCAD catalyzes the first dehydrogenation
  step in the beta-oxidation spiral for long-chain acyl-CoAs (C12-C20). Deficient oxidation leads to energy failure during
  fasting or catabolic stress, accumulation of toxic long-chain acylcarnitines, and impaired ketogenesis, with clinical manifestations
  ranging from severe neonatal cardiomyopathy and multiorgan failure to childhood hypoketotic hypoglycemia to later-onset
  exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis. Prevalence is estimated at 1:30,000 to 1:100,000 births.

progression:
- notes: 'Disease progression follows a cascade: catabolic triggers (fasting, illness, exercise) increase fatty acid mobilization
    and FAO demand. The VLCAD block reduces acetyl-CoA and ATP generation, impairing ketogenesis and causing hypoketotic hypoglycemia.
    Simultaneously, long-chain acylcarnitines and lipid intermediates accumulate, causing cellular toxicity. Secondary mitochondrial
    defects (ETC supercomplex disruption, oxidative stress) worsen bioenergetics. Tissue-level failure manifests as cardiomyopathy,
    rhabdomyolysis, and hepatic dysfunction. After diagnosis and management, rhabdomyolysis frequency decreases significantly
    (4.9 to 2.5 episodes per year in VLCAD).'
notes: 'Genotype-phenotype prediction in VLCAD deficiency is imperfect. Functional testing (residual enzyme activity) provides
  better prognostic information than genotype alone. With expanded newborn screening, milder phenotypes are increasingly detected,
  and overtreatment should be avoided. mRNA therapy approaches are in preclinical development and have shown promise in restoring
  VLCAD activity in patient fibroblasts and mouse models.
