name: Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans
description: >-
  Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, locally aggressive fibroblastic
  tumor of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue characterized by the COL1A1-PDGFB
  fusion gene. This translocation, typically t(17;22)(q22;q13), results in
  constitutive PDGF-BB expression driving autocrine PDGFR-beta signaling. DFSP
  exemplifies the success of targeted therapy in fusion-driven cancers, as the
  PDGFR inhibitor imatinib is highly effective for unresectable or metastatic
  disease. While locally aggressive with high recurrence rates after incomplete
  excision, DFSP rarely metastasizes. Wide local excision with Mohs micrographic
  surgery achieves the best local control. DFSP occurs in adults of all ages,
  most commonly on the trunk.

has_subtypes:
- name: Classic DFSP
  description: >-
    The typical form presenting as a slow-growing, indurated plaque that
    progressively develops a multinodular or protuberant appearance. Low
    metastatic potential.
- name: Fibrosarcomatous DFSP
  description: >-
    A higher-grade variant with fibrosarcomatous transformation in approximately
    10-15% of cases. Associated with increased local recurrence and metastatic
    potential. May lose imatinib sensitivity.
- name: Pigmented DFSP (Bednar Tumor)
  description: >-
    A variant containing melanin-producing dendritic cells, giving the tumor
    a pigmented appearance. Shares the same COL1A1-PDGFB fusion and clinical
    behavior as classic DFSP.
pathophysiology:
- name: COL1A1-PDGFB Fusion Oncogene
  description: >-
    The t(17;22)(q22;q13) translocation or supernumerary ring chromosomes
    containing material from chromosomes 17 and 22 fuse the COL1A1 gene to
    PDGFB. This places PDGFB under control of the highly active COL1A1 promoter,
    resulting in constitutive expression of a functional PDGF-BB growth factor.

  - target: Autocrine PDGFR Signaling
    description: PDGF-BB secretion activates PDGFR-beta on tumor cells
- name: Autocrine PDGFR Signaling
  description: >-
    Tumor cells secrete mature PDGF-BB which binds to PDGFR-beta on the same
    or neighboring tumor cells, creating an autocrine/paracrine growth loop.
    PDGFR-beta activation drives proliferation through the MAPK and PI3K
    pathways. This signaling can be blocked by imatinib.

    CD34 immunohistochemistry is diffusely positive in classic DFSP and
