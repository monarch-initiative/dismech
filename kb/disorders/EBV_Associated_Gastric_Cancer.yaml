name: EBV-Associated Gastric Cancer
description: >-
  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric cancer is a distinct molecular subtype
  of gastric adenocarcinoma characterized by clonal EBV infection of tumor cells,
  extreme CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP-high), frequent PIK3CA mutations,
  and JAK2/PD-L1/PD-L2 amplifications. EBV-positive gastric cancers comprise approximately
  9% of all gastric cancers worldwide and show unique features including prominent
  lymphoid infiltration, better prognosis than other subtypes, and potential responsiveness
  to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The viral oncoproteins LMP1, LMP2A, and EBNA1 drive
  epigenetic reprogramming and survival signaling in infected epithelial cells.

  description: >-
    Clonal EBV infection of gastric epithelial cells is the initiating event.
    Unlike EBV lymphomas where infection occurs in B cells, EBV gastric cancer
    involves epithelial cell tropism. The virus establishes latent infection
    (type I/II latency) with expression of EBNA1, LMP2A, and EBERs, with variable
    LMP1 expression. EBV-encoded oncoproteins drive epigenetic reprogramming and
    activate survival signaling pathways.

    snippet: Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) accounts for ~9-10% of gastric cancers worldwide and 
      is defined by a distinctive molecular profile, including extreme hypermethylation of the DNA.
    explanation: This abstract defines EBV-associated gastric cancer as a distinct molecular subtype and provides its 
      global frequency.
pathophysiology:
- name: EBV Latent Infection of Gastric Epithelium
  description: >-
    EBV establishes clonal latent infection in gastric epithelial cells, expressing
    a restricted set of latent genes including EBNA1 (required for viral genome
    maintenance), LMP2A (mimics B-cell receptor signaling), and non-coding EBERs.
    LMP1 expression is variable but when present activates NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways.

  description: >-
    EBV-associated gastric cancer displays the most extreme CpG island methylator
    phenotype (CIMP) of any cancer type. EBV-encoded proteins, particularly LMP2A,
    induce aberrant DNA methylation leading to silencing of tumor suppressor genes
    including CDKN2A (p16), CDH1 (E-cadherin), and MLH1. This epigenetic reprogramming
    is a hallmark feature distinguishing EBV-positive from EBV-negative gastric cancers.

- name: PI3K-AKT Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    PIK3CA mutations occur in approximately 80% of EBV-positive gastric cancers,
    the highest frequency of any gastric cancer subtype. Combined with LMP2A signaling
    which activates PI3K through mimicry of B-cell receptor signaling, this leads
    to constitutive AKT activation promoting cell survival and proliferation.

    Promoter hypermethylation silences multiple tumor suppressor genes. CDKN2A
    (p16INK4A) silencing removes G1/S checkpoint control. CDH1 (E-cadherin) silencing
    promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Unlike other gastric cancer subtypes,
    TP53 mutations are rare in EBV-positive tumors.

biochemical:
- name: EBV-Encoded Small RNAs (EBERs)
  notes: >-
    In situ hybridization for EBERs is the gold standard for diagnosing EBV-associated
    gastric cancer. EBERs are abundantly expressed non-coding RNAs present in all
    EBV latency programs and serve as reliable markers of EBV infection.
- name: PD-L1/PD-L2 Expression
  notes: >-
    JAK2/PD-L1/PD-L2 amplification at 9p24.1 is characteristic of EBV-positive
    gastric cancer, leading to high PD-L1 expression and potential responsiveness
    to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
genetic:
- name: PIK3CA
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    PIK3CA mutations occur in approximately 80% of EBV-positive gastric cancers,
    the highest rate among gastric cancer subtypes. Hotspot mutations in the
    helical (E545K) and kinase (H1047R) domains activate PI3K signaling.
- name: ARID1A
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    ARID1A mutations occur in approximately 55% of EBV-positive gastric cancers,
    contributing to chromatin remodeling dysfunction.
- name: CDKN2A
  association: Epigenetically Silenced
  notes: >-
    CDKN2A (p16INK4A) is silenced by promoter hypermethylation rather than
    mutation in EBV-positive gastric cancer, removing G1/S checkpoint control.

  description: >-
    EBV-positive gastric cancers show high expression of PD-L1 due to 9p24.1
    amplification and strong immune infiltration, making them potentially
    responsive to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab.
    This represents a molecularly-targeted approach based on the unique
    immunobiology of this subtype.
