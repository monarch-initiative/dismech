    label: obesity disorder
pathophysiology:
- name: Energy Imbalance
  description: >
    Chronic positive energy balance from excess caloric intake relative
    to expenditure leads to fat accumulation. Multiple regulatory systems
    (leptin, ghrelin, insulin) fail to restore balance.

      id: GO:0097009
      label: energy homeostasis
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:17212793
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Leptin is a mediator of long-term regulation of energy balance, suppressing food intake and thereby inducing weight loss. Ghrelin on the other hand is a fast-acting hormone, seemingly playing a role in meal initiation."
    explanation: Describes the role of leptin and ghrelin as key hormones regulating energy balance in obesity.
  - reference: PMID:17212793
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In obese subjects the circulating level of the anorexigenic hormone leptin is increased, whereas surprisingly, the level of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin is decreased. It is now established that obese patients are leptin-resistant."
    explanation: Explains the paradox of elevated leptin levels in obesity with concurrent leptin resistance, contributing to failed energy balance restoration.
- name: Adipose Tissue Dysfunction
  description: >
    Expanded adipose tissue becomes dysfunctional with increased inflammation,
    altered adipokine secretion, and impaired metabolic function. Adipocyte
    hypertrophy leads to hypoxia and macrophage infiltration.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:39456156
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Under various physiological or pathological conditions, adipose tissue shifts cellular composition, lipid storage, and organelle dynamics to respond to the stress; this remodeling is called \"adipose tissue plasticity\"."
    explanation: Describes the dynamic remodeling of adipose tissue in response to obesity, including changes in cellular composition and metabolic function.
  - reference: PMID:14679177
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Histologically, there is evidence of significant infiltration of macrophages, but not neutrophils and lymphocytes, into WAT of obese mice, with signs of adipocyte lipolysis and formation of multinucleate giant cells."
    explanation: Provides histological evidence of macrophage infiltration into dysfunctional adipose tissue in obesity.
  - reference: PMID:14679177
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "These data suggest that macrophages in WAT play an active role in morbid obesity and that macrophage-related inflammatory activities may contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-induced insulin resistance."
    explanation: Establishes the causal role of adipose tissue macrophages in obesity-related metabolic dysfunction.
- name: Chronic Low-Grade Inflammation
  description: >
    Systemic inflammation from adipose tissue contributes to insulin
    resistance, cardiovascular disease, and other complications. Elevated
    CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels.

  - preferred_term: Inflammatory Response

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:14679177
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Increasing evidence from human population studies and animal research has established correlative as well as causative links between chronic inflammation and insulin resistance."
    explanation: Establishes both correlative and causative links between chronic inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity.
  - reference: PMID:14679177
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "We propose that obesity-related insulin resistance is, at least in part, a chronic inflammatory disease initiated in adipose tissue."
    explanation: Proposes that obesity-induced insulin resistance represents a chronic inflammatory disease originating in adipose tissue.
  - reference: PMID:27503945
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Particularly chronic inflammation in adipose tissue seems to play an important role in the development of obesity-related insulin resistance."
    explanation: Highlights the central role of chronic adipose tissue inflammation in obesity-related insulin resistance.
- name: Hypothalamic Dysregulation
  description: >
    Central appetite regulation becomes impaired with leptin resistance
    and altered reward signaling, perpetuating overeating despite adequate
    energy stores.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38490517
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Leptin acts through its receptor LepRb, expressed mainly in the hypothalamus, and induces a negative energy balance by potent inhibition of feeding and activation of energy expenditure."
    explanation: Describes the central hypothalamic mechanism by which leptin normally regulates energy balance.
  - reference: PMID:38490517
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "However, the majority of patients with obesity presents elevated leptin production, suggesting that in this setting leptin is ineffective in the regulation of energy balance."
    explanation: Explains leptin resistance in obesity where elevated leptin fails to regulate energy balance through hypothalamic circuits.
