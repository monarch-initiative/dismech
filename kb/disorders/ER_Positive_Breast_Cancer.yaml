name: ER-Positive Breast Cancer
description: >-
  Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer is the most common molecularly-defined
  subtype of breast cancer, representing approximately 70-80% of cases. It is
  characterized by expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), which drives tumor
  growth in response to estrogen. ER+ breast cancer encompasses the luminal A and
  luminal B intrinsic subtypes, with generally favorable prognosis especially for
  luminal A tumors. Treatment centers on endocrine therapy to block estrogen signaling,
  with CDK4/6 inhibitors revolutionizing treatment of metastatic disease.

has_subtypes:
- name: Luminal A Breast Cancer
  description: >-
    ER+/HER2- with low proliferation (Ki-67 <20%). Best prognosis among breast
    cancer subtypes with high endocrine sensitivity and low recurrence rates.
    Often does not require chemotherapy.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:19436038
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: >-
      Luminal B tumors have higher proliferation and poorer prognosis than luminal
      A tumors.
    explanation: >-
      Supports luminal A versus luminal B prognostic and proliferation differences,
      but does not directly support all subtype-defining criteria in this descriptor.
- name: Luminal B Breast Cancer
  description: >-
    ER+/HER2- with high proliferation (Ki-67 ≥20%) or ER+/HER2+. Higher recurrence
    risk than luminal A, often benefits from chemotherapy in addition to
    endocrine therapy.
  evidence:

    snippet: >-
      the 10-year breast cancer-specific survival was 79% (95% CI = 76% to 83%)
      for luminal A, 64% (95% CI = 59% to 70%) for luminal B
    explanation: >-
      Supports worse survival for luminal B versus luminal A, but does not directly
      support all biomarker and treatment details in this descriptor.
pathophysiology:
- name: Estrogen Receptor Activation
  description: >-
    ER+ breast cancer is driven by estrogen-dependent activation of the estrogen
    receptor alpha (ERα), a nuclear hormone receptor that functions as a
    ligand-activated transcription factor. Estrogen binding induces receptor
    dimerization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation of target genes.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:41549581
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: At the heart of this subtype is the estrogen signaling pathway, especially the estrogen receptor alpha 
      (ERα), which plays a major role in the development, growth, and response to these cancers.
    explanation: This supports ERalpha pathway centrality, but not the full mechanistic detail in this descriptor.

    Activated ERα binds estrogen response elements (EREs) in target gene promoters,
    recruiting coactivators and driving transcription of genes promoting cell
    cycle progression (CCND1), survival (BCL2), and growth factor signaling
    (IGF1R, EGFR). This creates estrogen-dependent tumor growth.

    ESR1 mutations are rare in primary tumors but emerge in ~30-40% of metastatic
    ER+ breast cancer after aromatase inhibitor therapy. Mutations in the
    ligand-binding domain (Y537S, D538G) cause constitutive receptor activation
    and endocrine resistance.

    PIK3CA hotspot mutations (E545K, H1047R) occur in approximately 40% of ER+
    breast cancers. Confer partial endocrine resistance and identify patients
    who benefit from PI3K inhibitor alpelisib.
