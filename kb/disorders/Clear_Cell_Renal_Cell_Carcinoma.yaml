name: Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
description: >-
  Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of kidney
  cancer, characterized by biallelic inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor
  gene in over 90% of cases. VHL loss stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1α
  and HIF-2α), driving expression of angiogenic and growth-promoting genes including
  VEGF, PDGF, and TGF-α. This molecular understanding led to development of VEGF/VEGFR
  inhibitors and the more recent HIF-2α inhibitor belzutifan, representing a
  paradigm shift toward targeting the root cause of the disease.

has_subtypes:
- name: VHL-associated ccRCC
  description: >-
    Hereditary form occurring in Von Hippel-Lindau disease patients with germline
    VHL mutations. Tumors are typically bilateral and multifocal. Patients also
    develop hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
- name: Sporadic ccRCC
  description: >-
    Comprises 95% of ccRCC cases. Somatic VHL inactivation occurs through mutation,
    deletion, or promoter hypermethylation. Additional mutations in chromatin
    remodeling genes (PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2) affect prognosis.
pathophysiology:
- name: VHL Tumor Suppressor Inactivation
  description: >-
    Biallelic VHL loss is the initiating event in ccRCC. The VHL protein normally
    targets HIF-α subunits for ubiquitin-mediated degradation under normoxic
    conditions. Without functional VHL, HIF-α accumulates and constitutively
    activates hypoxia response genes.

    explanation: This comprehensive review confirms VHL as the primary genomic biomarker and driver mutation in ccRCC.
- name: HIF-2α Stabilization
  description: >-
    Without VHL-mediated degradation, HIF-2α protein accumulates in the cytoplasm
    and translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with HIF-1β (ARNT) to form
    an active transcription factor. HIF-2α is the critical HIF isoform in ccRCC.
