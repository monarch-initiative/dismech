name: IDH-Mutant Astrocytoma
description: >-
  IDH-mutant astrocytoma is a diffuse glioma defined by mutations in isocitrate
  dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/IDH2) and the absence of 1p/19q codeletion. Under the
  WHO 2021 classification, this molecularly defined entity encompasses tumors
  previously classified as diffuse astrocytoma (grade 2), anaplastic astrocytoma
  (grade 3), and astrocytic glioblastoma (grade 4). IDH mutations result in
  neomorphic enzyme activity producing D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite
  that inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, leading to global DNA
  hypermethylation (G-CIMP phenotype) and impaired cellular differentiation.
  Prognosis is significantly better than IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

has_subtypes:
- name: IDH-Mutant Astrocytoma Grade 2
  description: >-
    Low-grade diffuse astrocytoma with IDH mutation. Characterized by low cellularity,
    mild nuclear atypia, and absence of mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation,
    or necrosis. Patients typically present with seizures and have favorable prognosis
    with median survival of 10-15 years.
- name: IDH-Mutant Astrocytoma Grade 3
  description: >-
    Anaplastic astrocytoma with IDH mutation. Shows increased cellularity, nuclear
    atypia, and mitotic activity but lacks microvascular proliferation and necrosis.
    Median survival approximately 5-7 years.
- name: IDH-Mutant Astrocytoma Grade 4
  description: >-
    Astrocytoma with IDH mutation and either microvascular proliferation, necrosis,
    or homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion. Previously termed secondary glioblastoma.
    Despite grade 4 histology, prognosis is better than IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
pathophysiology:
- name: IDH1/2 Neomorphic Mutation
  description: >-
    Heterozygous mutations in IDH1 (R132H most common, >90%) or IDH2 (R172) confer
    neomorphic enzyme activity, converting alpha-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite
    D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). This occurs as an early clonal event in gliomagenesis.

    snippet: "This unique immune microenvironment is shaped by 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite produced by mutant IDH."
    explanation: This abstract directly states that mutant IDH produces 2-HG, supporting the neomorphic IDH activity described.

    description: Neomorphic IDH activity produces oncometabolite 2-HG

  description: >-
    D-2-hydroxyglutarate competitively inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent
    dioxygenases including TET2 (DNA demethylation) and Jumonji-domain histone
    demethylases. This results in global DNA hypermethylation (G-CIMP phenotype)
    and histone hypermethylation, blocking cellular differentiation.

  description: >-
    Epigenetic dysregulation caused by 2-HG prevents normal glial differentiation
    programs, maintaining cells in a proliferative progenitor-like state. This
    contributes to tumor formation but also underlies the better prognosis
    compared to IDH-wildtype tumors due to retained differentiation potential.

genetic:
- name: IDH1
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    IDH1 R132H mutation accounts for >90% of IDH-mutant astrocytomas. Can be detected
    by R132H-specific immunohistochemistry. Other R132 variants (R132C, R132S, R132G)
    occur less frequently.
- name: IDH2
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    IDH2 R172 mutations occur in approximately 3% of IDH-mutant gliomas, more common
    in oligodendrogliomas. Requires sequencing for detection.
- name: TP53
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations are present in approximately 70% of IDH-mutant astrocytomas and
    are typically mutually exclusive with 1p/19q codeletion, helping distinguish
    astrocytomas from oligodendrogliomas.
- name: ATRX
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    ATRX loss occurs in approximately 70% of IDH-mutant astrocytomas. Associated with
    alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). ATRX loss is mutually exclusive with
    1p/19q codeletion.
- name: CDKN2A
  association: Homozygous Deletion
  notes: >-
    Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/CDKN2B (9p21) confers grade 4 status regardless of
    histological features and is associated with worse prognosis.
biochemical:
- name: 2-Hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)
  notes: >-
    D-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates to millimolar concentrations in IDH-mutant tumors.
    Can be detected by MR spectroscopy (peak at 2.25 ppm) and serves as a non-invasive
    biomarker. Levels may decrease with effective therapy.
