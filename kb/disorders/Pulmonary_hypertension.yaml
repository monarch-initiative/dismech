review_notes: Pulmonary hypertension is a complex condition characterized by elevated
  blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right heart strain and failure
  over time. Symptoms are diverse, with dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain being common
  presentations. Diagnosis typically involves imaging and hemodynamic assessments,
  while treatment focuses on reducing pulmonary pressures and improving symptoms.
