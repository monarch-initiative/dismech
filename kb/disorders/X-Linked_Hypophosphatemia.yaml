name: X-Linked Hypophosphatemia
category: Mendelian
description: >
  X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common hereditary form of rickets,
  caused by loss-of-function mutations in PHEX, a phosphate-regulating endopeptidase.
  PHEX deficiency leads to elevated FGF23 levels, causing renal phosphate wasting
  and impaired 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis. This results in chronic
  hypophosphatemia, rickets/osteomalacia, short stature, and dental abnormalities.
  Burosumab (Crysvita), an anti-FGF23 antibody, is approved for treatment.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Renal Phosphate Wasting via FGF23 Excess
    description: >
      Loss-of-function mutations in PHEX lead to elevated circulating FGF23
      (fibroblast growth factor 23), a phosphaturic hormone produced by
      osteocytes. Elevated FGF23 acts on the kidney to downregulate sodium-
      phosphate cotransporters (NaPi-IIa/IIc) in the proximal tubule, causing
      renal phosphate wasting. FGF23 also suppresses 1-alpha-hydroxylase
      (CYP27B1), reducing conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to active
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, further impairing phosphate absorption.
