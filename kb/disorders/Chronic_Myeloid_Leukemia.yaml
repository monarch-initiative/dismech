description: >-
  Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), BCR-ABL1 positive, is a myeloproliferative neoplasm
  characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome, resulting from a reciprocal translocation
  t(9;22)(q34;q11) that creates the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The constitutively active
  BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase drives uncontrolled myeloid cell proliferation. CML is the
  paradigmatic example of oncogene addiction and targeted therapy success, with tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors transforming it from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition.
  This entry covers BCR-ABL1 positive CML, which represents approximately 95% of all CML cases.

parents:
- myeloid leukemia
stages:
- name: Chronic Phase
  description: >-
    Initial indolent phase characterized by mature granulocyte expansion with
    less than 10% blasts in blood or bone marrow. Most patients are diagnosed
    in this phase and respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
- name: Accelerated Phase
  description: >-
    Transitional phase marked by increasing blast counts (10-19%), basophilia,
    thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, and additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
    Indicates disease progression and decreased TKI responsiveness.
- name: Blast Crisis
  description: >-
    Terminal phase resembling acute leukemia with 20% or more blasts in blood
    or bone marrow. May be myeloid or lymphoid lineage. Poor prognosis with
    limited treatment options.

    snippet: "Clinical studies with the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571 in chronic myeloid leukemia demonstrate that many patients with advanced stage disease respond initially but then relapse."
    explanation: This paper demonstrates that advanced phase CML (blast crisis) has poor outcomes even with TKI therapy, reflecting disease progression.
pathophysiology:
- name: BCR-ABL1 Fusion Oncogene Formation
  description: >-
    The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation juxtaposes the ABL1 tyrosine kinase gene
    on chromosome 9 with the BCR gene on chromosome 22, creating the Philadelphia
    chromosome. The resulting BCR-ABL1 fusion protein has constitutive tyrosine
    kinase activity independent of normal regulatory mechanisms.

- name: Constitutive Tyrosine Kinase Activation
  description: >-
    The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase activity,
    bypassing normal growth factor regulation. This activates multiple downstream
    signaling cascades including RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and JAK-STAT pathways,
    promoting cell proliferation and survival.
