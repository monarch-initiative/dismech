description: >-
  MET exon 14 skipping non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a molecularly-defined
  lung cancer subtype driven by splice site mutations that cause exon 14 skipping in
  the MET receptor tyrosine kinase. MET exon 14 (METex14) alterations occur in approximately
  3-4% of NSCLC and are more common in older patients. Exon 14 encodes a juxtamembrane
  domain containing a CBL binding site required for receptor ubiquitination and degradation.
  Skipping this exon leads to prolonged MET signaling. Capmatinib and tepotinib are
  selective MET inhibitors approved for this indication.

has_subtypes:
- name: METex14 Splice Site Mutation
  description: >-
    Point mutations at splice donor or acceptor sites flanking exon 14 are the
    most common mechanism, causing exon 14 exclusion during mRNA splicing.
- name: METex14 Whole Exon Deletion
  description: >-
    Genomic deletion of the entire exon 14 region, a less common mechanism of
    exon 14 loss.
- name: METex14 with MET Amplification
  description: >-
    A subset of METex14-positive tumors also harbor MET gene amplification,
    which may increase oncogenic drive and affect inhibitor sensitivity.
pathophysiology:
- name: MET Exon 14 Splice Mutations
  description: >-
    MET exon 14 skipping results from splice site mutations that cause exclusion
    of exon 14 during pre-mRNA splicing. Exon 14 encodes a juxtamembrane regulatory
    domain containing a CBL E3 ubiquitin ligase binding site (Y1003). Loss of this
    domain prevents receptor ubiquitination and degradation, leading to prolonged
    MET signaling after ligand stimulation.

  description: >-
    METex14 skipping results in prolonged receptor activation and downstream signaling
    through RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and STAT3 pathways. HGF (hepatocyte growth factor)
    ligand binding triggers signaling, but receptor downregulation is impaired.

biochemical:
- name: MET Exon 14 Testing
  notes: >-
    METex14 testing requires RNA-based NGS or comprehensive DNA-based NGS that
    covers splice sites. Standard DNA sequencing may miss some splice mutations.
    IHC for MET overexpression is not reliable for detecting exon 14 skipping.
    PCR-based assays and RNA sequencing can detect the aberrant splice product.
genetic:
- name: MET
  association: Somatic Splice Site Mutation
  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    MET (7q31.2) encodes the hepatocyte growth factor receptor. Exon 14 skipping
    results from mutations at splice donor (3') or acceptor (5') sites, or within
    the exon itself. Over 100 different METex14 mutations have been identified.
    MET amplification can co-occur and may affect inhibitor sensitivity. MET is
    also a resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
