description: >
  Osteogenesis imperfecta type II is the most severe, perinatal lethal form of OI,
  caused by heterozygous dominant-negative mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2. Affected
  infants have extreme bone fragility with multiple fractures in utero, severe
  skeletal deformities, dark sclerae, and die from respiratory insufficiency due
  to pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to small thoracic cage and rib fractures.
  The mutations typically involve glycine substitutions in the Gly-X-Y repeat
  that disrupt collagen triple helix formation.

parents:
- Osteogenesis imperfecta
inheritance:
- name: Autosomal Dominant
  description: >
    Autosomal dominant inheritance. Most cases arise de novo. Parental
    gonadal mosaicism accounts for recurrence risk in families with
    apparently unaffected parents.

    snippet: >-
      Most babies have their own private de novo mutation. However, the recurrence
      rate is about 7% owing to germline mosaicism in one parent.
    explanation: >-
      Establishes that most cases are de novo but 7% recurrence risk due to
      parental gonadal mosaicism is a key genetic counseling consideration.
pathophysiology:
- name: Dominant-Negative Collagen Disruption
  description: >
    Glycine substitutions in the Gly-X-Y repeat of the collagen triple
    helical domain disrupt normal helix formation. The abnormal alpha chains
    are incorporated into trimers, producing structurally defective collagen
    that cannot form proper fibrils (dominant-negative effect). This results
    in severe deficiency of functional bone matrix.

    snippet: >-
      The mutations act in a dominant negative manner as the mutant pro alpha chains
      are incorporated into type I procollagen molecules that also contain normal
      pro
      alpha chains. The abnormal molecules are poorly secreted, more susceptible to
      degradation, and impair the formation of the extracellular matrix.

      substitutions in perinatal lethal OI.

genetic:
- name: COL1A1/COL1A2 Structural Mutations
  association: Causative
  notes: >
    Glycine substitutions in the Gly-X-Y repeat of COL1A1 or COL1A2 are the
    most common cause. Mutations closer to the C-terminus of the collagen
    molecule tend to be more severe due to the C-to-N direction of helix
    folding. Large deletions and splice mutations that preserve reading
    frame can also cause type II OI.

    snippet: >-
      Perinatal lethal osteogenesis imperfecta is the result of heterozygous mutations
      of the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes that encode the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains
      of type I collagen, respectively. Point mutations resulting in the substitution
      of Gly residues in Gly-X-Y amino acid triplets of the triple helical domain
      of
      the alpha 1(I) or alpha 2(I) chains are the most frequent mutations.
    explanation: >-
      Comprehensive review identifying glycine substitutions in Gly-X-Y triplets as
      the predominant mutation type in perinatal lethal OI.
