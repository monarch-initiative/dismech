description: >-
  Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome
  caused by germline pathogenic variants in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. It is
  characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors including clear cell
  renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastomas of the CNS and retina, pheochromocytomas,
  and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. VHL disease exemplifies the two-hit hypothesis
  for tumor suppressor genes and the role of hypoxia signaling dysregulation in
  tumorigenesis through constitutive HIF activation.

has_subtypes:
- name: VHL Type 1
  description: >-
    Characterized by low risk of pheochromocytoma but high risk of renal cell carcinoma,
    hemangioblastomas, and pancreatic tumors. Associated with truncating mutations,
    large deletions, and missense mutations affecting HIF binding.
- name: VHL Type 2A
  description: >-
    Characterized by pheochromocytoma and hemangioblastomas but low risk of renal
    cell carcinoma. Associated with specific missense mutations.
- name: VHL Type 2B
  description: >-
    High risk of all VHL-associated tumors including pheochromocytoma, renal cell
    carcinoma, and hemangioblastomas. Associated with specific missense mutations.
- name: VHL Type 2C
  description: >-
    Pheochromocytoma only, without other VHL manifestations. Associated with specific
    missense mutations that retain some HIF regulatory function.
pathophysiology:
- name: VHL Tumor Suppressor Loss
  description: >-
    Germline heterozygous VHL mutations result in one functional allele. Somatic
    loss or mutation of the remaining wild-type allele (second hit) eliminates VHL
    function, initiating tumorigenesis. This follows Knudson's two-hit hypothesis
    for tumor suppressor gene inactivation.

    snippet: "von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by biallelic inactivation of the VHL gene leading to abnormal or absent VHL protein function, and constitutive activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) that leads to pro-tumorigenic signaling."
    explanation: Confirms that biallelic VHL inactivation (consistent with two-hit hypothesis) leads to constitutive HIF activation and pro-tumorigenic signaling.
- name: Loss of HIF Degradation
  description: >-
    VHL protein (pVHL) functions as the substrate recognition component of an E3
    ubiquitin ligase complex that targets hydroxylated HIF-alpha subunits for
    proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions. Loss of VHL function prevents
    HIF-alpha degradation, allowing HIF accumulation even in the presence of oxygen.

    snippet: "The von-Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) is the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and functions as a master regulator of HIF activity by targeting the hydroxylated HIF-alpha subunit for ubiquitylation and rapid proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions."
    explanation: Defines pVHL as the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets hydroxylated HIF-alpha for proteasomal degradation.
  - reference: PMID:15162797
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "VHL tumor suppressor is a specific substrate-recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin complex, which regulates proteasomal degradation of the subunit of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF). Impaired VHL complex function leads to accumulation of HIF, overexpression of various HIF-induced gene products and formation of highly vascular neoplasia."
    explanation: Confirms that impaired VHL function leads to HIF accumulation due to loss of proteasomal degradation.
- name: Constitutive HIF Activation
  description: >-
    Stabilized HIF-alpha (primarily HIF-2alpha in RCC) dimerizes with HIF-1beta
    (ARNT) and translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription of
    hypoxia-responsive genes. This occurs constitutively regardless of oxygen
    levels, creating a pseudo-hypoxic state.

    snippet: "in VHL deficient cell lines, both HIF-alpha subunits are constitutively expressed, whereas re-introduction of a functional VHL gene restores the instability of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins under normoxic conditions."
    explanation: Demonstrates that VHL deficiency leads to constitutive HIF-alpha expression even under normoxic conditions, and that VHL restoration can reverse this effect.
- name: VEGF Overexpression and Angiogenesis
  description: >-
    VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) is a direct HIF target gene.
    Constitutive HIF activation leads to chronic VEGF overexpression, driving
    extensive tumor angiogenesis. This explains the highly vascular nature of
    VHL-associated tumors, particularly hemangioblastomas and clear cell RCC.

  description: >-
    HIF activates transcription of genes including PDGF, TGF-alpha, EGFR, GLUT1,
    and glycolytic enzymes. This promotes cell proliferation, survival, and a
    shift toward glycolytic metabolism (Warburg effect) that supports tumor growth.

    clinical criteria. Mutations include missense variants, truncating mutations,
    large deletions (detectable by MLPA), and deep intronic variants. Genotype-
    phenotype correlations guide surveillance: Type 1 mutations (truncating) have
