description: >
  Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a RASopathy caused by heterozygous
  germline mutations in BRAF, MAP2K1 (MEK1), MAP2K2 (MEK2), or KRAS, characterized
  by distinctive craniofacial features, congenital heart defects, ectodermal
  abnormalities (sparse hair, keratosis pilaris, ichthyosis), failure to thrive,
  and developmental delay. CFC syndrome represents the most severe end of the
  RASopathy spectrum in terms of cognitive impairment.

inheritance:
- name: Autosomal Dominant
  description: >
    Autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance. Nearly all cases
    arise de novo due to the severity of the phenotype limiting reproductive
    fitness. In a cohort of 43 cases, genotype distribution was BRAF (81%),
    MEK1 (14%), and MEK2 (5%).

    snippet: >-
      We identified 43 individuals with pathogenic variants in BRAF (81%),
      MEK1 (14%), or MEK2 (5%) genes.
    explanation: >-
      Large cohort study establishing genotype distribution in CFC syndrome,
      confirming BRAF as the predominant causative gene.
pathophysiology:
- name: RAS-MAPK Pathway Hyperactivation
  description: >
    Mutations in BRAF, MEK1, or MEK2 cause constitutive or enhanced activation
    of the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade, affecting cell proliferation and
    differentiation during development. BRAF mutations are most common (~75%),
    followed by MEK1/MEK2 mutations.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:16439621
    supports: PARTIAL
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: >-
      heterogeneous de novo missense mutations in three genes within the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway cause CFC syndrome.
      The majority of cases (18 out of 23) are caused by mutations in BRAF
    explanation: >-
      Landmark Science paper establishing that CFC syndrome is caused by de novo
      mutations in MAPK pathway genes, with BRAF as the predominant causative gene.

genetic:
- name: BRAF Mutations
  association: Causative
  notes: >
    BRAF mutations account for ~75% of CFC cases. Unlike somatic BRAF V600E
    mutations in cancer, germline CFC mutations are typically kinase-impaired
    but still activate the pathway through RAF dimerization (Q257R, E501G).

    snippet: >-
      The majority of cases (18 out of 23) are caused by mutations in BRAF,
      a gene frequently mutated in cancer. Of the 11 mutations identified,
      two result in amino acid substitutions that occur in tumors, but most
      are unique and suggest previously unknown mechanisms of B-Raf activation.
    explanation: >-
      Establishes BRAF as the major causative gene, with mutations distinct from
      common somatic cancer mutations, suggesting novel activation mechanisms.
- name: MAP2K1/MAP2K2 Mutations
  association: Causative
  notes: >
    MEK1 (MAP2K1) and MEK2 (MAP2K2) mutations account for ~25% of CFC cases.
    These mutations typically increase MEK kinase activity.

      patients without BRAF mutations.
