inheritance:
- name: Autosomal dominant
- name: Autosomal recessive
pathophysiology:
- name: Red Cell Membrane Protein Deficiency
  description: >
    Loss or dysfunction of key membrane skeleton proteins (ankyrin, band 3,
    spectrin, protein 4.2) that anchor the lipid bilayer to the spectrin-actin
    cytoskeleton. This weakens the vertical interactions between the membrane
    skeleton and lipid bilayer, leading to progressive membrane loss.

    explanation: Identifies the five membrane proteins whose defects cause hereditary spherocytosis.
- name: Membrane Surface Area Loss and Spherocyte Formation
  description: >
    Progressive loss of membrane through microvesiculation converts
    normal biconcave discocytes into spherocytes with reduced surface
    area-to-volume ratio and decreased deformability. Spherocytes cannot
    traverse the narrow splenic fenestrations.

- name: Splenic Sequestration and Hemolysis
  description: >
    Rigid spherocytes are trapped and destroyed in the spleen, which
    is the primary site of hemolysis. The spleen acts as a quality
    control filter, selectively removing cells with reduced deformability.
    This extravascular hemolysis is the main cause of anemia.
