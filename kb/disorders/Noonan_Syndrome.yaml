description: >-
  Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant RASopathy caused by germline mutations
  in genes of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, most commonly PTPN11. It is characterized
  by distinctive facial features, short stature, congenital heart defects (particularly
  pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and variable developmental delays.
  It is one of the most common genetic syndromes associated with congenital heart disease,
  with an estimated incidence of 1:1,000 to 1:2,500 live births.
