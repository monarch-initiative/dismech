description: >
  Lipoyl transferase 1 deficiency (OMIM 616299) is a rare autosomal recessive
  mitochondrial disorder caused by biallelic mutations in LIPT1, encoding
  lipoyltransferase 1. LIPT1 catalyzes the final step in the mitochondrial
  lipoylation pathway, transferring lipoyl groups from lipoyl-GCSH to the E2
  subunits of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenases (pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase).
  Critically, LIPT1 deficiency spares the glycine cleavage system, as GCSH is
  lipoylated upstream by the LIPT2-LIAS pathway. This results in combined
  dehydrogenase deficiency with lactic acidosis but typically normal glycine
  levels, distinguishing it biochemically from LIPT2 and LIAS deficiency.
  Clinical presentation includes Leigh-like encephalopathy, seizures, dystonia,
  spastic tetraparesis, and variable hepatic involvement. Onset is neonatal to
  early infantile. Metabolic decompensation during febrile illness may
  precipitate acute neurological deterioration.

pathophysiology:
- name: Defective lipoyl relay via LIPT1 deficiency
  description: >
    LIPT1 encodes lipoyltransferase 1, which transfers lipoyl groups from
    lipoyl-GCSH to the E2 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate
    dehydrogenase, and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase. This is the final
    step in the mitochondrial lipoylation pathway. Crucially, LIPT1 is not
    required for lipoylation of GCSH itself, so the glycine cleavage system
    remains functional. This explains the distinctive biochemical signature:
    combined dehydrogenase deficiency with lactic acidosis but preserved glycine
    cleavage and normal glycine levels. The clinical consequence is a Leigh-like
    encephalopathy driven by energy failure rather than the combined energy
    failure plus glycine toxicity seen in LIPT2 and LIAS deficiency.

- name: Combined alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency with spared glycine cleavage
  description: >
    Loss of LIPT1 function impairs lipoylation of the E2 subunits of PDHc,
    alpha-KGDHc, and BCKDHc, causing combined dehydrogenase deficiency with
    lactic acidosis and elevation of alpha-ketoacids. However, the glycine
    cleavage system H protein (GCSH) is lipoylated upstream by the LIPT2-LIAS
    pathway and does not require LIPT1 for its own lipoylation, so glycine
    cleavage is preserved and glycine levels remain normal or near-normal.
