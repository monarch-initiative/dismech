description: >-
  Renal cell carcinoma is the most common form of kidney cancer arising from
  renal epithelial cells.
pathophysiology:
- name: Renal Epithelial Malignancy
  description: >-
    Malignant transformation of renal epithelial cells gives rise to renal cell
    carcinoma with diverse molecular subtypes.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28898679
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The most common form of kidney cancer arises from renal epithelium, named renal cell carcinoma (RCC)."
    explanation: The abstract identifies RCC as arising from renal epithelium.
- name: Histologic and Molecular Heterogeneity
  description: >-
    Renal cell carcinoma comprises multiple histological and molecular
    subtypes, reflecting heterogeneous biology.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28898679
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "This entity comprises different histological and molecular subtypes."
    explanation: The abstract notes RCC heterogeneity across histologic and molecular subtypes.

      label: Hematuria
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:6625621
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Hematuria is an important symptom, and in our series 46% of the patients with renal cell carcinomas were conscious of macrohematuria as an initial symptom."
    explanation: The abstract identifies hematuria as an important presenting symptom of RCC.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "As an initial symptom, a mass was palpable in 8% and flank pain was felt in 13% of the patients with renal cell carcinomas."
    explanation: The abstract reports flank pain as an initial symptom in RCC patients.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Unraveling the molecular biology and cytogenetic of RCC has enabled the development of several targeted agents that have improved treatment outcomes of these patients."
    explanation: The abstract notes targeted agents as effective therapies for RCC.
