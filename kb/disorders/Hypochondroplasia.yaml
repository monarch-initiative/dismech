description: >
  Hypochondroplasia is a milder FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia characterized by
  proportionate or mildly disproportionate short stature, with less pronounced features
  than achondroplasia. The most common mutation is FGFR3 N540K (c.1620C>A or c.1620C>G),
  found in approximately 50-70% of clinically diagnosed cases. Unlike achondroplasia,
  the phenotype is variable and may not be recognized until later childhood. Macrocephaly
  is less prominent, and spinal stenosis is less common. The diagnosis may be challenging
  in individuals with subtle features.

parents:
- FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia
inheritance:
- name: Autosomal dominant
  description: >
    Hypochondroplasia follows autosomal dominant inheritance. Many cases are de novo
    mutations. Compound heterozygosity for achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia alleles
    results in an intermediate phenotype more severe than hypochondroplasia alone.
pathophysiology:
- name: FGFR3 gain-of-function signaling (mild)
  description: >
    The FGFR3 N540K mutation causes constitutive activation of the receptor, but with
    less severe effects than the G380R mutation in achondroplasia. This results in
    moderately impaired endochondral ossification with reduced chondrocyte proliferation
    in the growth plate, leading to mild short stature.

    Adults typically have heights in the low-normal to mildly short range, with average
    adult height of 145-165 cm. Short stature may be proportionate or mildly

  notes: >
    The c.1620C>A or c.1620C>G (p.Asn540Lys) mutation is found in 50-70% of clinically
    diagnosed hypochondroplasia cases. Other FGFR3 mutations account for additional cases,
    but 30-50% of clinically diagnosed patients have no identifiable FGFR3 mutation,
    suggesting genetic heterogeneity or phenotypic overlap with other conditions.

notes: >
  Hypochondroplasia represents the mild end of the FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia
  spectrum. The phenotype can be subtle, and many cases may go undiagnosed. Unlike
  achondroplasia, cognitive development is typically normal and major complications
  such as foramen magnum stenosis are rare. The condition should be considered in
  individuals with mild short stature and subtle skeletal features, particularly if
  there is a family history suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance.
