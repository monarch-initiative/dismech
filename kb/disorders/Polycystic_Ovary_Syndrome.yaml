pathophysiology:
- name: Hyperandrogenism
  description: >
    Excess androgen production from ovarian theca cells and adrenal glands
    leads to hirsutism, acne, and alopecia. Elevated LH stimulates theca
    cell androgen production.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Androgen Biosynthesis
    term:
      id: GO:0006702
      label: androgen biosynthetic process
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38152131
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Compelling evidence suggests that hyperandrogenism is not just a primary feature of PCOS. Instead, it may be a causative factor for this condition."
    explanation: This review establishes hyperandrogenism as potentially causative rather than merely symptomatic in PCOS pathophysiology.
  - reference: PMID:24014605
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "LHCGR and 17α-hydroxylase/17-20-lyase (CYP17A1) protein levels are increased in polycystic ovaries (PCOs)."
    explanation: Direct evidence of increased androgen biosynthetic machinery (CYP17A1) in PCOS ovaries, supporting intrinsic theca cell abnormality.
  - reference: PMID:24014605
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "A significant increase in the intensity of immunostaining for CYP17A1 was identified in antral follicles in sections of PCO compared with ovaries from normal women (P = 0.04)."
    explanation: Quantitative demonstration of elevated CYP17A1 protein in polycystic ovaries compared to controls.
  - reference: PMID:24014605
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "A higher proportion of theca cells from anovulatory PCO expressed LHCGR protein when compared with control ovaries (P = 0.01)."
    explanation: Increased LH receptor expression in theca cells explains heightened LH-driven androgen production in PCOS.
- name: Insulin Resistance
  description: >
    Peripheral insulin resistance leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia,
    which stimulates ovarian androgen production and inhibits hepatic
    SHBG synthesis, increasing free androgens.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Insulin Signaling
    term:
      id: GO:0008286
      label: insulin receptor signaling pathway
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:40013621
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Hyperinsulinemia (i.e., elevated insulin without hypoglycemia) is a common metabolic feature of PCOS that worsens its reproductive symptoms by exacerbating pituitary hormone imbalances and increasing levels of bioactive androgens."
    explanation: Demonstrates the direct mechanistic link between hyperinsulinemia and worsening of reproductive and androgenic features in PCOS.
  - reference: PMID:40013621
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "However, it is challenging to define the sequential relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, as they are tightly interlinked, and evidence suggests that hyperinsulinemia can alternatively precede insulin resistance."
    explanation: Challenges traditional causality and suggests hyperinsulinemia may be primary rather than compensatory in some PCOS cases.
  - reference: PMID:40013621
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Notably, other drivers of hyperinsulinemia (outside of insulin resistance) may be highly relevant in the context of PCOS. For instance, high androgen levels can augment both hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, generating a self-perpetuating cycle of reproductive and metabolic dysfunction."
    explanation: Describes the vicious cycle where androgens exacerbate both hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in PCOS.
- name: Ovulatory Dysfunction
  description: >
    Disrupted folliculogenesis with arrest at small antral stage leads
    to anovulation. Multiple small follicles accumulate (polycystic
    morphology) without dominant follicle selection.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Ovulation
    term:
      id: GO:0030728
      label: ovulation
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:14671196
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Because PCOS is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in growing FN, we investigated whether an increased AMH serum level correlates to other hormonal and/or U/S features of PCOS."
    explanation: Documents the 2-3 fold increase in small growing follicle number characteristic of PCOS polycystic morphology.
  - reference: PMID:14671196
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Mean serum AMH level was markedly increased in the PCOS group (47.1 +/- 22.9 vs. 20.8 +/- 11.6 pmol/liter in controls; P < 0.0001), an increase in the same order of magnitude as the one of the FN in the 2- to 5-mm range at U/S (12.8 +/- 8.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.9; P < 0.0001, respectively)."
    explanation: Shows parallel elevation of AMH levels and small antral follicle count in PCOS, implicating AMH in follicular arrest.
  - reference: PMID:14671196
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "We hypothesize that an increased AMH tone within the cohort could be involved in the follicular arrest of PCOS, by interacting negatively with FSH at the time of selection."
    explanation: Proposes mechanism by which elevated AMH interferes with FSH action to prevent dominant follicle selection in PCOS.
- name: Chronic Low-Grade Inflammation
  description: >
    Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6) contribute to insulin
    resistance and cardiovascular risk in PCOS.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Inflammatory Response

    snippet: "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is related to pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory conditions generated by Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress."
    explanation: Establishes the link between ER stress, inflammation, and apoptotic pathways in PCOS pathophysiology.
  - reference: PMID:39036884
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The levels of TNF-α (p = 0.009), IL-18 (p = 0.003), IL-6 (p = 0.013) and active caspase-3 (p = 0.012) were also statistically significant lower in the therapy group."
    explanation: Clinical trial evidence demonstrating elevated TNF-α, IL-18, and IL-6 levels in PCOS patients at baseline, confirming chronic inflammatory state.
