  Van Buchem disease (hyperostosis corticalis generalisata) is an autosomal
  recessive sclerosing bone dysplasia caused by a 52-kb homozygous deletion
  downstream of the SOST gene. Unlike sclerosteosis, where SOST coding mutations
  abolish sclerostin, Van Buchem disease results from deletion of a distant
  bone-specific enhancer element (ECR5) that is required for SOST transcription
  in osteocytes. The deletion leads to downregulation of sclerostin expression,
  producing a similar but generally milder phenotype than sclerosteosis.
  Van Buchem disease lacks the hand malformations and tall stature seen in
  sclerosteosis. This was one of the first examples of a human disease caused
  by deletion of a distant regulatory element rather than a coding mutation.

inheritance:

  description: >
    Autosomal recessive inheritance. All known patients from an extended
    Dutch inbred family. The 52-kb deletion results from homologous
    recombination between Alu sequences.

pathophysiology:
- name: ECR5 Enhancer Deletion Causing SOST Downregulation
  description: >
    A 52-kb deletion starting approximately 35 kb downstream of the SOST
    gene removes a bone-specific enhancer element (ECR5) required for SOST
    transcription in adult bone. The deletion results from homologous
    recombination between Alu sequences. No gene is present within the
    deleted region; instead, the deletion removes a cis-regulatory element
    that drives sclerostin expression in osteocytes. BAC transgenesis
    confirmed that only the wild-type SOST allele expresses high levels
    of sclerostin in adult bone.

    snippet: "a 52 kb deletion in all patients from the van Buchem family. The deletion, which results from a homologous recombination between Alu sequences, starts approximately 35 kb downstream of the SOST gene"
    explanation: "Identifies the 52-kb downstream deletion as the Van Buchem disease mutation."
  - reference: PMID:11836356
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "no evidence was found for the presence of a gene within the deleted region, we hypothesise that the presence of the deletion leads to a down regulation of the transcription of the SOST gene by a cis regulatory action or a position effect"
    explanation: "Establishes that the deletion affects gene regulation rather than removing a coding gene."
  - reference: PMID:15965026
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Only the SOST(wt) allele faithfully expressed high levels of human SOST in the adult bone and had an impact on bone metabolism, consistent with the model that the VB noncoding deletion removes a SOST-specific regulatory element"
    explanation: "BAC transgenesis confirms the Van Buchem deletion removes a SOST-specific regulatory element."

    snippet: "we were able to identify a candidate enhancer element that drives human SOST expression in osteoblast-like cell lines in vitro and in the skeletal anlage of the embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mouse embryo"
    explanation: "Identifies the ECR5 enhancer element within the deleted region that drives bone-specific SOST expression."
- name: Reduced Sclerostin and Excessive Wnt-Mediated Bone Formation
  description: >
    Reduced sclerostin expression from ECR5 enhancer loss leads to
    insufficient antagonism of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in osteoblasts,
    causing excessive bone formation. The phenotype is similar to but
    generally milder than sclerosteosis (where coding mutations completely
    abolish sclerostin), lacking the hand malformations and tall stature.

genetic:
- name: SOST Regulatory Deletion

  notes: >
    Homozygous 52-kb deletion downstream of SOST gene on chromosome
    17q12-q21. The deletion removes a bone-specific enhancer (ECR5)
    but no coding genes. Van Buchem disease and sclerosteosis map to
    the same chromosomal region and involve the same gene (SOST) but
    through different mechanisms: coding mutations (sclerosteosis) vs
    regulatory deletion (Van Buchem). Van Buchem disease generally
    lacks the hand malformations and tall stature of sclerosteosis.
