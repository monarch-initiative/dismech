    label: Rett syndrome
has_subtypes:
- name: Classic Rett Syndrome
  description: Typical presentation with regression, hand stereotypies, gait abnormalities, and acquired microcephaly.
- name: Atypical Rett Syndrome
  description: Variants including preserved speech, early seizure onset, or congenital forms.
pathophysiology:
- name: MECP2 Dysfunction
  description: >
    Mutations in MECP2 gene cause loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 function.
    MECP2 is a transcriptional regulator that binds methylated DNA and modulates
    gene expression critical for neuronal maturation and synaptic function.

    snippet: "MeCP2 selectively binds CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome and mediates transcriptional repression through interaction with histone deacetylase and the corepressor SIN3A"
    explanation: Original discovery paper confirms MeCP2 functions as a transcriptional regulator through DNA methylation binding.
- name: Abnormal Neuronal Development
  description: >
    Loss of MECP2 leads to reduced dendritic arborization, decreased synapse formation,
    and impaired synaptic plasticity. Neurons have smaller cell bodies and reduced
    connectivity, particularly affecting inhibitory circuits.
