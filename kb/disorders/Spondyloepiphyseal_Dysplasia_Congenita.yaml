  Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC) is a type 2 collagenopathy caused
  by heterozygous mutations in COL2A1, characterized by disproportionate short-trunk
  short stature, platyspondyly, and abnormal epiphyses. Unlike the lethal forms
  (ACG2, hypochondrogenesis), SEDC is compatible with survival into adulthood.
  Associated features include myopia, retinal detachment risk, hearing loss, and
  odontoid hypoplasia with cervical instability risk. SEDC demonstrates variable
  expressivity even within families with the same mutation.

    snippet: "Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC) is an autosomal dominantly
      inherited chondrodysplasia characterized by disproportionate short stature (short
      trunk), abnormal epiphyses, and flattened vertebral bodies. Manifestations are
      present at birth."
    explanation: This linkage study confirmed the autosomal dominant inheritance
      pattern of SEDC in a 4-generation family.
pathophysiology:
- name: Type II Collagen Dysfunction
  description: >
    COL2A1 mutations in SEDC produce partially functional type II collagen that
    is incorporated into cartilage matrix but with compromised structural integrity.
    This results in abnormal endochondral ossification affecting the spine and
    epiphyses, as well as ocular and auricular cartilage abnormalities.

    Type II collagen is a major component of the vitreous humor. Abnormal
    collagen leads to vitreous liquefaction, posterior vitreous detachment,
    and increased risk of retinal detachment.

    snippet: "Individuals affected with these disorders exhibit abnormalities of the
      growth plate, nucleus pulposus, and vitreous humor, which are tissues that contain
      type II collagen."
    explanation: This study documents that vitreous humor abnormalities are a
      feature of COL2A1-related chondrodysplasias including SEDC, due to type II
      collagen being a major component of the vitreous.
genetic:
- name: COL2A1 Mutations
  association: Causative

    Heterozygous mutations in COL2A1 including missense mutations, small
    in-frame deletions, and splice site mutations. Mutations are distributed
    throughout the gene, with some genotype-phenotype correlations observed.

    snippet: "Previous evidence suggesting defects of type II collagen associated
      with the SEDC phenotype led us to genotype the family for various COL2A1 gene-associated
      RFLPs. A total of 17 affected and unaffected members of this family were studied.
      The family was informative for a recently discovered HinfI RFLP. No recombinants
      between the marker and the phenotype were found in eight informative meioses.
      A maximum LOD score of 3.01 was obtained at a recombination fraction of .00.
      Our results indicate that the SEDC phenotype in this family is caused by mutations
      in or very close to the COL2A1 locus."
    explanation: This landmark linkage study established that SEDC is caused by
      mutations in or near the COL2A1 gene, with a highly significant LOD score
      of 3.01.

    snippet: "A clinical spectrum of chondrodysplasia phenotypes, ranging from mild
      to perinatal lethal, is due to defects in the gene for type II collagen, COL2A1.
      This spectrum includes Stickler syndrome, Kniest dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal
      dysplasia congenita (SEDC), achondrogenesis type II, and hypochondrogenesis."
    explanation: This study confirms SEDC is part of the clinical spectrum of
      COL2A1-related chondrodysplasias and demonstrates that COL2A1 mutations
      produce a range of phenotypes including SEDC.
