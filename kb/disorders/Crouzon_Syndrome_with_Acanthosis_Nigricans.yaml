name: Crouzon Syndrome with Acanthosis Nigricans
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (CAN) is a distinct craniosynostosis
  syndrome caused by a specific heterozygous mutation (A391E) in FGFR3. It combines
  the craniofacial features of Crouzon syndrome (craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia,
  proptosis) with acanthosis nigricans, a hyperpigmented velvety skin change. The
  condition demonstrates that FGFR3 mutations can cause craniosynostosis similar to
  FGFR2-related Crouzon syndrome, with additional cutaneous manifestations reflecting
  broader FGFR3 signaling effects.

inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
    description: >
      Autosomal dominant inheritance. Most cases arise de novo, though
      familial transmission has been documented.
pathophysiology:
  - name: FGFR3 A391E Gain-of-Function
    description: >
      The A391E mutation in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3 causes
      ligand-independent receptor dimerization and constitutive activation.
      This affects both skeletal (craniosynostosis) and cutaneous (acanthosis
      nigricans) tissues through enhanced downstream signaling including
      MAPK and STAT pathways.

        snippet: "Recent evidence suggests that the phenotypic differences may be due to specific alleles with varying degrees of ligand-independent activation, allowing the receptor to be constitutively active."
        explanation: >
          This evidence supports the gain-of-function mechanism where FGFR3 mutations cause
          constitutive receptor activation leading to the disease phenotype.

        snippet: "The association of non-dwarfing and even non-skeletal conditions with FGFR3 mutations reveals the potential for a wide range of FGFR pleiotropic effects as well as locus heterogeneity in Crouzon syndrome."
        explanation: >
          Demonstrates that FGFR3 mutations can affect multiple tissue types including both
          skeletal (craniosynostosis) and cutaneous (acanthosis nigricans) tissues.
genetic:

    association: Causative
    notes: >
      A single recurrent mutation, c.1172C>A (p.Ala391Glu), in FGFR3 causes
      this syndrome. The mutation is in the transmembrane domain and causes
      ligand-independent receptor activation through constitutive dimerization.

        explanation: >
          This is the landmark paper identifying the A391E mutation in FGFR3 as the cause of
          Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, demonstrating the genetic basis of this
          distinct disorder.

          This review confirms FGFR3 mutations cause CSAN and places it in the context of
