description: >-
  Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with PML-RARA is a distinct subtype of acute
  myeloid leukemia characterized by the t(15;17)(q24;q21) translocation creating
  the PML-RARA fusion oncogene. This fusion blocks myeloid differentiation at the
  promyelocyte stage and confers sensitivity to differentiation therapy with
  all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). APL was historically
  the most fatal AML subtype due to severe coagulopathy, but is now the most curable,
  with ATRA plus ATO achieving greater than 90% cure rates without conventional
  chemotherapy. APL represents the paradigm of differentiation therapy in cancer.

pathophysiology:
- name: PML-RARA Fusion Oncogene Formation
  description: >-
    The t(15;17)(q24;q21) translocation fuses the PML gene on chromosome 15 with
    the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17. The resulting
    fusion protein retains the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains of RARA
    but gains aberrant properties from PML, including enhanced corepressor
    recruitment and altered subnuclear localization.

    snippet: Dysfunction of the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway, which is mediated by the formation of the PML-RARA fusion gene, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
    explanation: This abstract directly links PML-RARA fusion to APL pathogenesis, supporting the fusion oncogene mechanism.

  description: >-
    PML-RARA binds retinoic acid response elements but recruits corepressor
    complexes (NCoR, SMRT, HDACs) at physiological retinoic acid concentrations.
    This silences RARA target genes required for granulocyte differentiation,
    causing a differentiation block at the promyelocyte stage. Pharmacological
    doses of ATRA overcome this block.

  description: >-
    Wild-type PML organizes nuclear bodies that regulate multiple cellular
    processes including apoptosis and senescence. PML-RARA disrupts PML nuclear
    bodies into a microspeckled pattern, impairing PML tumor suppressor functions.
    Arsenic trioxide restores PML nuclear bodies and induces PML-RARA degradation.

    Characteristic findings include prolonged PT and PTT, markedly elevated
    D-dimer, and decreased fibrinogen. Rapid correction with ATRA initiation
    is essential to prevent fatal hemorrhage.
- name: PML-RARA Fusion Detection
  notes: >-
    RT-PCR detects PML-RARA fusion transcripts and identifies breakpoint
    location (bcr1, bcr2, or bcr3). Essential for diagnosis confirmation
    and minimal residual disease monitoring. FISH detects the t(15;17).
genetic:
- name: PML-RARA Fusion
  association: Defining Genetic Lesion
  notes: >-
    The t(15;17)(q24;q21) translocation creates PML-RARA fusion in greater
    than 95% of APL. Three breakpoint variants exist (bcr1/long, bcr2/variant,
    bcr3/short) with different PML portions. The fusion is necessary and
    sufficient for APL phenotype and predicts response to ATRA and ATO.
- name: FLT3-ITD
  association: Cooperating Mutation
  notes: >-
    FLT3-ITD occurs in 30-40% of APL cases and is associated with higher
    white blood cell counts at presentation. Prognostic significance is
    less clear in the ATRA+ATO era but may identify patients benefiting
    from intensification.
treatments:
- name: All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA)
  description: >-
    Pharmacological doses of ATRA (45 mg/m2/day) overcome PML-RARA-mediated
    transcriptional repression, inducing differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes
    into mature granulocytes. Must be started immediately upon clinical suspicion,
    even before molecular confirmation. Foundation of APL treatment.

  description: >-
    The combination of ATRA and ATO without chemotherapy achieves greater than

    toxicities including secondary malignancies and cardiomyopathy. Represents
    the standard of care for non-high-risk APL.

  description: >-
    ATRA combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy remains an option,
    particularly for high-risk APL (WBC greater than 10,000/uL) where early death
    risk is higher. Idarubicin is commonly used. ATO is increasingly incorporated
    into chemotherapy regimens.
