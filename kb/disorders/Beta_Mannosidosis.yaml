description: >
  A rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of
  lysosomal beta-mannosidase enzyme, leading to accumulation of mannose-containing
  oligosaccharides in tissues and body fluids. Clinical manifestations include
  intellectual disability, hearing loss, and variable neurological involvement.

- Oligosaccharidoses
pathophysiology:
- name: Beta-mannosidase deficiency
  description: >
    Loss or marked reduction of beta-mannosidase activity impairs lysosomal
    catabolism of glycoprotein-derived oligosaccharides, leading to intra-lysosomal
    storage and cellular vacuolation. Electron microscopy demonstrates prominent
    lysosomal enlargement in patient cells.

      a rare lysosomal storage disorder named beta-mannosidosis whose clinical
      manifestation includes deafness and mental retardation

      Confirms that beta-mannosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder with
      neurological and auditory manifestations.

      10 beta-mannosidosis patients of Roma origin from eight families in the
      Czech and Slovak Republics with hearing loss, mental retardation

genetic:
- name: MANBA gene mutations
  association: Causal
  notes: >
    Biallelic pathogenic variants in MANBA cause beta-mannosidosis. The c.2158-2A>G
    variant is a prevalent founder allele among Czech/Slovak Roma with carrier
    frequency of 3.77%, about 925 times higher than gnomAD frequency.

  - name: Autosomal recessive
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:32847582

    snippet: >-
      carrier/heterozygote frequency of 3.77%. This is about 925 times higher
      than the frequency of this variant in the gnomAD public database
    explanation: >-
      Identifies a founder variant with high carrier frequency in Roma populations,
      demonstrating genetic basis of the disease.
biochemical:
- name: Urinary free oligosaccharides
  presence: Elevated
  context: Diagnostic biomarker
  notes: >
    Accumulated oligosaccharides including Man-GlcNAc disaccharide and sialylated
    derivatives are detected in urine. Modern UPLC-MS/MS allows multiplexed detection
    for glycoproteinoses.
- name: Beta-mannosidase activity
  presence: Reduced
  context: Diagnostic enzymatic assay
  notes: >
    Affected individuals exhibit enzyme activities ranging from undetectable up to
    2-10% of normal controls. Carriers may show approximately 40% activity.
treatments:
- name: Supportive care

    Symptom management including speech therapy, physical therapy, educational support,
    and management of hearing impairment with hearing aids or cochlear implants.

notes: >
  Beta-mannosidosis is extremely rare with only approximately 33 patients described
  worldwide as of 2020. The disease shows marked clinical variability even among
  individuals with similar genotypes. The c.2158-2A>G founder variant is particularly
  important in Central European Roma populations.
