description: >-
  A rare, severely disabling genetic disorder characterized by progressive
  heterotopic ossification of skeletal muscles, fascia, tendons, and ligaments,
  with congenital malformation of the great toes. The condition is caused by
  gain-of-function mutations in the ACVR1 gene encoding a BMP type I receptor,
  leading to aberrant bone formation in soft tissues.
pathophysiology:
- name: Constitutive BMP Signaling Activation
  description: >-
    The ACVR1 R206H mutation creates a pH-sensitive switch in the receptor's
    activation domain, leading to ligand-independent activation of BMP
    signaling and inappropriate osteogenic differentiation of connective
    tissue progenitors.

        The study demonstrates that the R206H mutation causes BMP signal
        activation in muscle tissue, leading to ectopic bone formation.

      Protein modeling predicts that substitution with histidine, and only
      histidine, creates a pH-sensitive switch within the activation domain
      of the receptor that leads to ligand-independent activation of ACVR1
      in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.
    explanation: >-
      This study explains the unique molecular mechanism of the R206H mutation
      creating pH-dependent receptor dysregulation.
- name: Impaired FKBP1A Regulatory Binding
  description: >-
    The R206H mutation reduces binding affinity for FKBP1A/FKBP12, a safeguard
    protein that normally prevents inappropriate BMP signaling, resulting in
    leaky activation of the pathway.

      a known safeguard molecule against the leakage of transforming growth
      factor (TGF)-beta or BMP signaling
    explanation: >-
      Loss of FKBP1A binding is a key mechanism allowing leaky BMP signaling.
  downstream:
  - target: Constitutive BMP Signaling Activation
    description: Loss of FKBP1A inhibition lowers the activation threshold for
      mutant ACVR1 signaling.
- name: Activin A Neomorphic Signaling
  description: >-
    The R206H mutation renders ACVR1 responsive to Activin A ligands, which
    normally antagonize BMP signaling. This neomorphic gain-of-function
    allows Activin A to aberrantly activate osteogenic signaling, driving
    heterotopic ossification. Anti-Activin A antibodies can block HO.
    Activin A is an obligate factor for the initiation of HO in FOP.

    explanation: >-
