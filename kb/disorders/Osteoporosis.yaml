pathophysiology:
- name: Bone Remodeling Imbalance
  description: >
    Increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption relative to osteoblast-
    mediated bone formation leads to net bone loss. This imbalance
    accelerates with aging and estrogen deficiency.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:21874760
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "aromatase activity and estrogen production are necessary for longitudinal bone growth, attainment of peak bone mass, the pubertal growth spurt, epiphyseal closure, and normal bone remodeling in young individuals."
    explanation: Demonstrates that estrogen, produced by aromatase, is essential for normal bone remodeling and that deficiency leads to bone loss
  - reference: PMID:23748068
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Estrogen deficiency can induce delayed epiphyseal closure, eunuchoid body habitus, osteopenia, and osteoporosis in both genders."
    explanation: Clinical evidence showing that estrogen deficiency directly causes osteoporosis through impaired bone remodeling
- name: RANKL/OPG Dysregulation
  description: >
    Increased RANKL and decreased osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio promotes
    osteoclast differentiation and activation. Estrogen normally
    suppresses RANKL and increases OPG.

  - preferred_term: Osteoclast Differentiation
    term:
      id: GO:0030316
      label: osteoclast differentiation
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:33692806
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The differentiation of osteoclasts is induced significantly in the presence of IL-17 either directly (207), or indirectly, through upregulation of RANKL."
    explanation: Demonstrates that RANKL upregulation is a key mechanism for osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption
  - reference: PMID:21874760
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "with aging, individual differences in aromatase activity and thus in estrogen levels may significantly affect bone loss and fracture risk in both genders."
    explanation: Shows that age-related decline in estrogen production affects bone metabolism, linking to RANKL/OPG dysregulation
- name: Microarchitectural Deterioration
  description: >
    Loss of trabecular connectivity and cortical thinning compromises
    bone strength beyond what BMD alone indicates. Leads to fragility
    fractures with minimal trauma.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:23748068
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "recurrent bone fractures associated with minimal trauma starting in puberty"
    explanation: Clinical case demonstrating that estrogen deficiency leads to fragility fractures due to compromised bone microarchitecture

    snippet: "aromatase activity and estrogen production are necessary for longitudinal bone growth, attainment of peak bone mass, the pubertal growth spurt, epiphyseal closure, and normal bone remodeling in young individuals."
    explanation: Demonstrates that estrogen deficiency impairs achievement and maintenance of peak bone mass, leading to decreased BMD

  evidence:

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "extraglandular aromatization of circulating androgen precursors is the major source of estrogen not only in men (since only 15% of circulating estradiol is released directly by the testis) but also in women after the menopause."
    explanation: Post-menopausal women rely on aromatase activity for estrogen production, making aromatase activity critical for bone health after menopause
  - reference: PMID:18567553
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "studies in these unusual patients have stimulated research on defining the role of estrogen in regulating bone metabolism in normal adult and aging men, providing further insights into estrogen regulation of bone metabolism not only in men, but also in women."
    explanation: Demonstrates that estrogen is essential for bone metabolism in both sexes, with deficiency leading to osteoporosis
