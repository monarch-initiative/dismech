name: Kniest Dysplasia
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Kniest dysplasia is a moderately severe type 2 collagenopathy caused by
  heterozygous COL2A1 mutations, characterized by disproportionate short-trunk
  dwarfism, enlarged joints with restricted mobility, dumbbell-shaped long bones,
  flat face, myopia, hearing loss, and cleft palate. The skeletal features are
  distinctive with a characteristic "Swiss cheese" appearance of cartilage on
  histology due to abnormal collagen fibril formation. Named after Wilhelm Kniest
  who described the condition in 1952.

      Autosomal dominant inheritance, with most cases arising from de novo

pathophysiology:
  - name: Type II Collagen Structural Abnormality
    description: >
      Kniest dysplasia is typically caused by exon-skipping mutations or small
      in-frame deletions in COL2A1 that result in shortened collagen chains.
      These abnormal chains are incorporated into the extracellular matrix but
      form defective fibrils. The characteristic cartilage histology shows large
      empty areas (Swiss cheese appearance) due to abnormal collagen organization.

          Pathologic findings included a disorganized physeal growth plate, soft
          crumbly cartilage with a "Swiss-cheese" appearance, and diastase resistant
          intracytoplasmic inclusions in the resting chondrocytes. Transmission
          electronmicroscopy showed dilated cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum
          with finely granular material of accumulated protein. Scanning
          electronmicroscopy documented striking fragmentation and disintegration of
          collagen fibrils resulting in a web-like pattern and large open cyst-like
          spaces, and deficiency and disorganization of the collagen fibrils.
        explanation: >-
          This study documents the characteristic Swiss-cheese cartilage appearance
          and demonstrates collagen fibril disorganization and fragmentation in
          Kniest dysplasia, supporting the pathophysiology description.

          In each case collagen fibril organization appeared abnormal by electron
          microscopy compared with age-matched normal cartilages: fibrils were much
          thinner, of irregular shape and did not exhibit the characteristic banding
          pattern. This was associated with the absence (compared with normal
          cartilage) of the C-propeptide of type II collagen (chondrocalcin) from
          the extracellular matrix of epiphyseal cartilages.
        explanation: >-
          This study demonstrates abnormal collagen fibril organization in Kniest
          dysplasia cartilage, with thinner fibrils lacking normal banding pattern
          and absence of C-propeptide from extracellular matrix.
genetic:

    association: Causative
    notes: >
      Heterozygous mutations in COL2A1, characteristically exon-skipping mutations
      and small in-frame deletions in the triple helical domain. These produce
      shortened collagen alpha chains that are incorporated into fibrils but
      cause structural abnormalities.

          We studied a 2-year-old girl presenting with manifestations of Kniest
          dysplasia and her mother showing a Stickler phenotype. Analysing COL2A1 in
          both patients, we detected the same 28 basepair deletion spanning the
          3'-exon/intron boundary of exon 12 in mother and daughter.
        explanation: >-
          This study identifies a 28bp deletion at the exon 12 splice boundary in
          COL2A1 causing Kniest dysplasia, demonstrating that exon-boundary
          mutations (which lead to exon skipping) cause the disorder.

          Six dominant disease-causing COL2A1 variants were detected. In three
          cases, testing of parental samples revealed that the disease-causing
          variant was not present in either parent.
        explanation: >-
          This study confirms that Kniest dysplasia is associated with heterozygous
          COL2A1 mutations that are frequently de novo.
