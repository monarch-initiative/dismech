pathophysiology:
- name: Bacterial overgrowth in small intestine
  description: >
    Excessive bacterial colonization of the small intestine leads to malabsorption,
    nutrient deficiencies, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Disruption of gastric acid,
    motility (including migrating motor complex), and the ileocecal barrier promotes
    overgrowth. Bacterial fermentation produces hydrogen, methane, and short-chain
    fatty acids while bile acid deconjugation impairs fat absorption.
