parents:
- Gastrointestinal disorders
- Dysbiosis syndromes
pathophysiology:
- name: Bacterial overgrowth in small intestine
  description: >
    Excessive bacterial colonization of the small intestine leads to malabsorption,
    nutrient deficiencies, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Disruption of gastric acid,
    motility (including migrating motor complex), and the ileocecal barrier promotes
    overgrowth. Bacterial fermentation produces hydrogen, methane, and short-chain
    fatty acids while bile acid deconjugation impairs fat absorption.

    snippet: "Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been recognized for
      over a century in patients with predisposing conditions causing intestinal stasis,
      such as surgical alteration of the small bowel or chronic diseases"
    explanation: ESNM/ANMS practice update confirms SIBO is well-established in
      stasis conditions.
