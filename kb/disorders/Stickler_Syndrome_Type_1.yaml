  Stickler syndrome type 1 (STL1) is the most common and mildest form of the type
  2
  collagenopathy spectrum, caused by heterozygous COL2A1 mutations that typically
  result in haploinsufficiency. It is characterized by vitreous abnormalities
  (membranous or beaded vitreous), high myopia, retinal detachment risk, sensorineural
  hearing loss, midface hypoplasia, and joint hypermobility with early-onset
  osteoarthritis. Unlike the more severe collagenopathies, skeletal features are
  relatively mild with variable expressivity. STL1 is the membranous vitreous type.

inheritance:
- name: Autosomal Dominant
  description: >
    Autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance but variable expressivity.
    Both familial cases and de novo mutations occur.
pathophysiology:
- name: Type II Collagen Haploinsufficiency
  description: >
    Most STL1 mutations cause premature termination codons leading to nonsense-
    mediated decay and haploinsufficiency of type II collagen. This results in
    quantitative rather than qualitative collagen deficiency, producing a milder
    phenotype than dominant-negative mutations. Tissues with high type II collagen
    content (vitreous, cartilage, inner ear) are primarily affected.

      Stickler syndrome type 1 is predominantly caused by loss-of-function

      to result in nonsense-mediated decay.
    explanation: >
      Large-scale genotype-phenotype study of 100 STL1 patients confirms that
      the majority of COL2A1 mutations cause haploinsufficiency through NMD.

    explanation: >
      Study examining vitreous phenotypes confirms that premature termination
      codons causing haploinsufficiency are the predominant mutation type in STL1.
- name: Vitreous Collagen Abnormality
  description: >
    Type II collagen is essential for vitreous structure. Reduced collagen
    leads to vitreous liquefaction with characteristic membranous remnants
    visible on slit-lamp examination, posterior vitreous detachment, and
    increased retinal detachment risk.

      Experience has shown that vitreous slit-lamp biomicroscopy can distinguish
      between patients with COL2A1 mutations and those with dominant negative
      mutations in COL11A1, who produce a different "beaded" vitreous phenotype.

      The membranous vitreous phenotype can be used to distinguish STL1 (COL2A1)
      from STL2 (COL11A1), supporting its diagnostic utility.
