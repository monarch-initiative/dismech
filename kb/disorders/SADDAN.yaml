name: SADDAN
category: Mendelian
description: >
  SADDAN (Severe Achondroplasia with Developmental Delay and Acanthosis Nigricans) is
  a rare, severe FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia caused by the heterozygous K650M
  mutation. It represents an intermediate phenotype between achondroplasia and
  thanatophoric dysplasia, with severe skeletal features but potential for survival
  beyond infancy. Key distinguishing features include the presence of acanthosis nigricans
  (hyperpigmented, velvety skin) and developmental delay/intellectual disability, which
  are not typical of other FGFR3 skeletal dysplasias. The condition demonstrates how
  different mutations at the same codon (K650) can produce distinct clinical phenotypes.

inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal dominant (de novo)
    description: >
      All reported cases have been de novo mutations. Given the severity of the
      condition, affected individuals do not reproduce, so the mutation is not
      transmitted to offspring.
pathophysiology:
  - name: FGFR3 gain-of-function (K650M)
    description: >
      The K650M mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain causes constitutive activation
      of FGFR3, intermediate in severity between the G380R mutation (achondroplasia)
      and K650E (thanatophoric dysplasia type 2). This results in severe inhibition
      of endochondral ossification, but not as complete as in TD2, allowing potential
      survival. The K650M mutation may also affect neuronal FGFR3 signaling, potentially
      explaining the developmental delay seen in SADDAN but not in other FGFR3 skeletal
      dysplasias.

    description: >
      FGFR3 is expressed in keratinocytes, and the K650M mutation may affect epidermal
      cell proliferation and differentiation, leading to acanthosis nigricans. This
      skin manifestation distinguishes SADDAN from other FGFR3 skeletal dysplasias and
      suggests tissue-specific effects of this particular mutation.

genetic:

    association: Causative
    notes: >
      The c.1949A>T (p.Lys650Met) mutation is the specific cause of SADDAN. This mutation
      is at the same codon as the K650E mutation (TD2) and K650Q mutation (hypochondroplasia
      variant), demonstrating how different amino acid substitutions at a single position
      produce distinct phenotypes. The K650M mutation causes intermediate receptor
      activation between K650Q and K650E.

notes: >
  SADDAN is extremely rare, with fewer than 20 cases reported in the literature.
  The condition illustrates the genotype-phenotype correlations within the FGFR3
  spectrum: the K650 codon is critical for receptor kinase activity, and different
  substitutions produce phenotypes ranging from mild (K650Q in some hypochondroplasia)
  to severe viable (K650M in SADDAN) to lethal (K650E in TD2). The presence of
  developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans in SADDAN suggests tissue-specific
  effects of the K650M mutation that are not seen with mutations at other FGFR3
  positions.
