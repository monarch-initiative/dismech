description: >
  SADDAN (Severe Achondroplasia with Developmental Delay and Acanthosis Nigricans) is
  a rare, severe FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia caused by the heterozygous K650M
  mutation. It represents an intermediate phenotype between achondroplasia and
  thanatophoric dysplasia, with severe skeletal features but potential for survival
  beyond infancy. Key distinguishing features include the presence of acanthosis nigricans
  (hyperpigmented, velvety skin) and developmental delay/intellectual disability, which
  are not typical of other FGFR3 skeletal dysplasias. The condition demonstrates how
  different mutations at the same codon (K650) can produce distinct clinical phenotypes.

      The c.1949A>T (p.Lys650Met) mutation is the specific cause of SADDAN. This mutation
      is at the same codon as the K650E mutation (TD2) and K650Q mutation (hypochondroplasia
      variant), demonstrating how different amino acid substitutions at a single position
      produce distinct phenotypes. The K650M mutation causes intermediate receptor

notes: >
  SADDAN is extremely rare; one report noted only a handful of molecularly confirmed
  cases at the time of publication.
  The condition illustrates the genotype-phenotype correlations within the FGFR3
  spectrum: the K650 codon is critical for receptor kinase activity, and different
  substitutions produce phenotypes ranging from mild (K650Q in some hypochondroplasia)
  to severe viable (K650M in SADDAN) to lethal (K650E in TD2). The presence of
  developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans in SADDAN suggests tissue-specific
  effects of the K650M mutation that are not seen with mutations at other FGFR3
  positions.
