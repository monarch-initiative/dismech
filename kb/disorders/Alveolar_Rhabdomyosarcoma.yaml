description: >-
  Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is an aggressive pediatric soft tissue sarcoma
  characterized by skeletal muscle differentiation and distinctive chromosomal
  translocations involving PAX3 or PAX7 fused to FOXO1. The PAX3-FOXO1 fusion,
  resulting from t(2;13)(q35;q14), is present in approximately 55% of cases and
  confers a worse prognosis. PAX7-FOXO1 from t(1;13)(p36;q14) occurs in about 22%
  of cases with somewhat better outcomes. Approximately 20% are fusion-negative
  and behave more like embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The PAX-FOXO1 fusion proteins
  function as aberrant transcription factors driving myogenic differentiation
  arrest and proliferation.

has_subtypes:
- name: PAX3-FOXO1 Fusion-Positive
  description: >-
    The most common and aggressive subtype, harboring the t(2;13)(q35;q14)
    translocation. Associated with older age at diagnosis, extremity primary
    sites, and inferior survival compared to other subtypes.
- name: PAX7-FOXO1 Fusion-Positive
  description: >-
    Harbors the t(1;13)(p36;q14) translocation. Generally diagnosed at younger
    age and associated with better prognosis than PAX3-FOXO1 positive tumors.
- name: Fusion-Negative Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma
  description: >-
    Approximately 20% of histologically defined ARMS lack PAX-FOXO1 fusions.
    These tumors have clinical behavior and molecular features more similar
    to embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.
pathophysiology:
- name: PAX-FOXO1 Fusion Oncogene
  description: >-
    The t(2;13) or t(1;13) translocations fuse the DNA-binding domain of PAX3
    or PAX7 with the transactivation domain of FOXO1. The resulting fusion
    protein functions as a potent aberrant transcription factor that activates
    PAX target genes to supraphysiological levels, driving proliferation while
    blocking terminal myogenic differentiation.

- name: Blocked Myogenic Differentiation
  description: >-
    PAX-FOXO1 fusion protein blocks the normal myogenic differentiation program
    by interfering with MYOD1 and myogenin function. Tumor cells express early
    myogenic markers (desmin, myogenin) but fail to complete differentiation
    into mature skeletal muscle, remaining in a proliferative progenitor state.

  description: >-
    PAX-FOXO1 activates genes promoting cell cycle progression and survival,
    including MYCN, which is commonly amplified in ARMS. The fusion protein
    also suppresses apoptosis through multiple mechanisms, contributing to
    tumor aggressiveness.

biochemical:
- name: PAX-FOXO1 Fusion Detection
  notes: >-
    RT-PCR, FISH, or next-generation sequencing detection of PAX3-FOXO1 or
    PAX7-FOXO1 fusion is diagnostic and prognostic. Fusion status is more
    predictive of outcome than histologic classification.
- name: Myogenic Markers
  notes: >-
    Immunohistochemistry shows expression of myogenic markers including
    desmin, myogenin, and MyoD1. Myogenin shows diffuse strong nuclear
    positivity, which helps distinguish from embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.
