  predisposition syndrome caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair
  genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). It significantly increases the risk of
  colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, and other cancers, typically presenting at
  younger ages than sporadic cancers.

    snippet: Germline mutations of 4 MMR genes, e.g., MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2,
      had been identified as the cause of this disease, however, a novel
      mechanism, epigenetic inactivation of MSH2 gene due to hypermethylation of
      promotor region by the deletion of 3'part of epithelial cell adhesion
      molecule(EPCAM) gene which is located upstream of the MSH2 gene, has been
      reported in recent years.
    explanation: This reference describes the mechanism by which EPCAM gene
      deletion causes epigenetic inactivation of the MSH2 gene, supporting the
      statement.
  - reference: PMID:30461124
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Monoallelic deletions of the 3' end of EPCAM that silence the
      downstream gene, MSH2, cause a form of Lynch syndrome, which is a cancer
      predisposition syndrome associated with loss of DNA mismatch repair.
    explanation: This reference further supports the statement by specifying
      that deletions of the EPCAM gene silence the MSH2 gene, leading to Lynch
      syndrome.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: These patients carry deletions of the 3' end of the EPCAM gene,
      including its polyadenylation signal. Due to concomitant transcriptional
      read-through of EPCAM, the promoter of MSH2 15 kb further downstream
      becomes inactivated through hypermethylation.

      deletions lead to the inactivation of MSH2, supporting the statement.
