name: Hypophosphatasia
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare inherited metabolic bone disease caused by
  loss-of-function mutations in ALPL, encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline
  phosphatase (TNSALP). Deficient TNSALP activity leads to accumulation of its
  substrates including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), which inhibits
  hydroxyapatite crystal formation and thus bone mineralization. The clinical
  spectrum ranges from perinatal lethal to mild adult forms with premature loss
  of deciduous teeth. Asfotase alfa (Strensiq) is an approved enzyme replacement
  therapy for pediatric-onset HPP.

        snippet: >-
          severe HPP is recessive and rare, moderate HPP is recessive or dominant and
          more common, and mild HPP, characterized by low alkaline phosphatase and
          unspecific clinical signs, is dominantly inherited and very common
        explanation: "Establishes that severe HPP is recessive while mild HPP is dominant, confirming genotype-phenotype correlation with inheritance pattern."

        explanation: "Most dominant adult HPP cases involve haploinsufficiency rather than dominant negative effect."
pathophysiology:
  - name: Defective Bone Mineralization
    description: >
      ALPL encodes tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP),
      which hydrolyzes inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) at the osteoblast
      surface. Loss of TNSALP activity leads to accumulation of PPi,
      a potent inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystal growth. This results
      in defective mineralization of bone and teeth (rickets/osteomalacia).
