pathophysiology:
- name: Hemoglobin Polymerization
  description: >
    Deoxygenated HbS polymerizes into rigid fibers, deforming red
    blood cells into sickle shape. HbS has glutamic acid to valine
    substitution at position 6 of beta-globin.

- name: Red Blood Cell Sickling
  description: >
    Sickled RBCs are rigid and fragile, leading to hemolytic anemia
    and shortened RBC lifespan (10-20 days vs normal 120 days).

    snippet: "intravascular hemolysis in SCD releases heme that activates endothelial TLR4 signaling leading to WPB degranulation, NF-κB activation, and vaso-occlusion."
    explanation: Heme released from hemolysis triggers TLR4 signaling on endothelial cells, leading to Weibel-Palade body degranulation and release of P-selectin and von Willebrand factor, which promote adhesion and vaso-occlusion.
- name: Chronic Hemolysis
  description: >
    Intravascular hemolysis releases free hemoglobin, scavenging
    nitric oxide and causing endothelial dysfunction, pulmonary
    hypertension, and stroke risk.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:15998894
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "hemolysis contributes to reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction via release of erythrocyte arginase, which limits arginine bioavailability, and release of erythrocyte hemoglobin, which scavenges nitric oxide."
    explanation: Hemolysis releases both arginase (which depletes L-arginine, the substrate for nitric oxide synthesis) and free hemoglobin (which directly scavenges nitric oxide), leading to endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.
  - reference: PMID:15998894
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The ratios of arginine to ornithine and arginine to ornithine plus citrulline are independently associated with pulmonary hypertension and increased mortality in patients with sickle cell disease."
    explanation: Low arginine bioavailability due to increased arginase activity is directly associated with pulmonary hypertension severity and mortality risk in SCD patients.

    snippet: "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by recurring episodes of vascular occlusion in which neutrophil activation plays a major role. The disease is associated with chronic hemolysis with elevated cell-free hemoglobin and heme."
    explanation: Neutrophil activation and hemolysis contribute to vascular occlusion and acute complications like acute chest syndrome.

    snippet: "we have identified a novel role for heme in the induction of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in SCD. NETs are decondensed chromatin decorated by granular enzymes and are released by activated neutrophils."
    explanation: Heme triggers neutrophil extracellular trap formation, which contributes to acute lung injury and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease.
