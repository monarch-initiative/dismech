    snippet: "intravascular hemolysis in SCD releases heme that activates endothelial TLR4 signaling leading to WPB degranulation, NF-κB activation, and vaso-occlusion."

  description: >
    Intravascular hemolysis releases free hemoglobin, scavenging
    nitric oxide and causing endothelial dysfunction, pulmonary
    hypertension, and stroke risk.

    snippet: "hemolysis contributes to reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction via release of erythrocyte arginase, which limits arginine bioavailability, and release of erythrocyte hemoglobin, which scavenges nitric oxide."
    explanation: Hemolysis releases both arginase (which depletes L-arginine, the substrate for nitric oxide synthesis) and free hemoglobin (which directly scavenges nitric oxide), leading to endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.
