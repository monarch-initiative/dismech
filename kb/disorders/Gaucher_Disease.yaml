    label: Gaucher disease
has_subtypes:
- name: Type 1 (Non-neuronopathic)
  description: Most common (95%), no CNS involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, bone disease, variable onset.
- name: Type 2 (Acute neuronopathic)
  description: Severe infantile neurodegeneration, death by age 2-4 years.
- name: Type 3 (Chronic neuronopathic)
  description: Intermediate, systemic and neurological involvement, slower progression than Type 2.
pathophysiology:
- name: Glucocerebrosidase Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in the GBA gene cause deficient beta-glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase) enzyme.
    This enzyme normally degrades glucocerebroside (glucosylceramide) in lysosomes.
    Without it, glucocerebroside accumulates primarily in macrophages.

- name: Gaucher Cell Formation
  description: >
    Lipid-laden macrophages (Gaucher cells) accumulate in spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other organs.
