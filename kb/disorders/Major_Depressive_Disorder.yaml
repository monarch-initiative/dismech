  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38256041
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The link between mitochondria and major depressive disorder (MDD) is increasingly evident, underscored both by mitochondria's involvement in many mechanisms identified in depression and the high prevalence of MDD in individuals with mitochondrial disorders."
    explanation: This establishes the connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and MDD, noting both mechanistic involvement and epidemiological evidence.
  - reference: PMID:38256041
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Similarities were observed between the Mito patient and a broader MDD cohort, including decreased respiration and mitochondrial function."
