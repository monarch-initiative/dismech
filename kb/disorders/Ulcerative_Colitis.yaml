    snippet: "IBD has a consistent signature across studies and allows high classification accuracy of IBD from non-IBD subjects."
    explanation: Meta-analysis confirms IBD has consistent microbiota signatures distinguishing patients from healthy controls.

- name: Loss of Keystone SCFA Producers
  description: >
    Depletion of butyrate-producing Firmicutes, particularly Faecalibacterium
    prausnitzii, Roseburia spp., and Eubacterium rectale. These keystone taxa
    are network hubs supporting community structure through cross-feeding.
  notes: >
    F. prausnitzii is anti-inflammatory; its supernatant reduces colitis in
    animal models. Roseburia and Eubacterium are primary butyrate producers
    via the acetyl-CoA pathway.

    explanation: Sokol et al. demonstrated F. prausnitzii depletion is consistently observed in IBD.
  - reference: PMID:18936492

    explanation: F. prausnitzii has direct anti-inflammatory properties beyond its role as butyrate producer.

- name: Pathobiont Expansion
  description: >
    Bloom of opportunistic pathobionts including adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC),
    Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Enterobacteriaceae. These taxa exploit the
    ecological niche vacated by depleted commensals and promote inflammation
    through LPS and direct epithelial invasion.
  downstream:
  - target: Mucosal Inflammation
    description: Pathobionts produce LPS and other pro-inflammatory molecules
  - target: Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction
    description: AIEC can invade epithelial cells and disrupt tight junctions
  evidence:

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes Bacteroidia and Clostridia."
    explanation: Dysbiosis in IBD involves expansion of Enterobacteriaceae pathobionts alongside depletion of beneficial obligate anaerobes.

- name: Decreased Butyrate Production
  description: >
    Reduced fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations, particularly
    butyrate. Butyrate is the primary energy source for colonocytes (providing
    ~70% of energy needs) and exerts anti-inflammatory effects via HDAC
    inhibition and GPR109A signaling.

    explanation: While this study focused on T2D, it demonstrates the general principle that dysbiosis involves loss of butyrate producers - a pattern also seen in IBD.

- name: Impaired Colonocyte Energy Metabolism
  description: >
    Colonocytes deprived of butyrate shift from beta-oxidation to glycolysis,
    causing energy deficit. This impairs tight junction maintenance, mucus
    production by goblet cells, and epithelial renewal from crypt stem cells.

- name: Increased Microbial Community Instability
  description: >
    Anna Karenina effect - dysbiotic microbiomes show increased inter-individual
    variability and temporal instability compared to healthy controls. The
    community loses resilience and may occupy an alternative stable state that
    resists therapeutic intervention.
  notes: >
    "All healthy microbiomes are alike; each dysbiotic microbiome is dysbiotic
    in its own way." This increased stochasticity complicates biomarker discovery
    and explains heterogeneous treatment responses.

  - target: Loss of Microbial Diversity
    description: Feedback loop - community instability promotes further diversity loss
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28836573
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The result is an 'Anna Karenina principle' for animal microbiomes, in which dysbiotic individuals vary more in microbial community composition than healthy individuals-paralleling Leo Tolstoy's dictum that 'all happy families look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way'."
    explanation: Zaneveld et al. demonstrated the Anna Karenina principle applies to disease-associated microbiomes.
- name: NLRP3 Inflammasome-Mediated Pyroptosis
  description: >

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "SLC6A14 promotes UC pyroptosis by regulating NLRP3, suggesting the therapeutic potential of modulating the SLC6A14/NLRP3 axis."
    explanation: SLC6A14 promotes UC progression through NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis, identifying this as a key pathophysiological mechanism and potential therapeutic target.
