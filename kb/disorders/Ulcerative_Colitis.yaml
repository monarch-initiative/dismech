    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Longitudinal comparisons demonstrated disease progression in nonremission: myeloid and T cell perturbations in CD and increased multi-cellular IFN signalling in UC."
    explanation: Increased multi-cellular interferon signaling is associated with disease progression and non-remission in UC, indicating this is a critical pathway in dysregulated immune response.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Addressing an upstream pathological mechanism shared between these disorders, this drug class has high efficacy rates and a durable response that extends dosing intervals up to 3 months."
    explanation: IL-23 inhibitors target an upstream pathological mechanism in UC with high efficacy (up to 50% in IBD), supporting the role of aberrant immune signaling in disease pathogenesis.
- name: Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction
  description: >
    Disrupted tight junctions and mucus layer allow bacterial
    translocation, perpetuating inflammation. Goblet cell depletion
    reduces protective mucus.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "A systems biology-spatial analysis identified granuloma signatures in CD and interferon (IFN)-response signatures localising to T cell aggregates and epithelial damage in CD and UC."
    explanation: Interferon-response signatures are spatially localized to epithelial damage sites in UC, directly linking immune responses to barrier disruption.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Luminal epithelial cells in patients with irColitis expressed PCSK9, PD-L1 and interferon-induced signatures associated with apoptosis, increased cell turnover and malabsorption."
    explanation: Epithelial cells express interferon-induced signatures associated with apoptosis and increased cell turnover, demonstrating the mechanism of barrier dysfunction in inflammatory colitis.
  - reference: PMID:38724705
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Together, these data suggest roles for circulating T cells and epithelial-immune crosstalk critical to PD-1/CTLA-4-dependent tolerance and barrier function and identify potential therapeutic targets for irColitis."
    explanation: Epithelial-immune crosstalk is critical to barrier function, confirming that disruption of this interaction underlies epithelial barrier dysfunction in colitis.
  - reference: PMID:39438660
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Pretreatment differences in epithelial and myeloid compartments were associated with remission outcomes in both diseases."
    explanation: Epithelial compartment differences predict treatment outcomes, emphasizing the central role of epithelial dysfunction in UC pathogenesis.
