name: Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
description: >-
  Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a neuroendocrine malignancy arising from
  the parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid gland. Approximately 25% of cases are
  hereditary, caused by germline RET proto-oncogene mutations in MEN2A, MEN2B, or
  familial MTC syndromes. Sporadic MTC also frequently harbors somatic RET mutations.
  MTC secretes calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), providing useful
  biomarkers. The identification of RET as the driver oncogene led to development
  of selective RET inhibitors like selpercatinib and pralsetinib.

has_subtypes:
- name: Hereditary MTC (MEN2A)
  description: >-
    Associated with MEN2A syndrome caused by germline RET mutations in the
    extracellular cysteine-rich domain. Patients develop MTC, pheochromocytoma,
    and primary hyperparathyroidism. Prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended.
- name: Hereditary MTC (MEN2B)
  description: >-
    Associated with MEN2B syndrome caused by germline RET M918T mutation in
    the kinase domain. Most aggressive form with mucosal neuromas, marfanoid
    habitus, and very early MTC onset. Pheochromocytoma also occurs.
- name: Sporadic MTC
  description: >-
    Approximately 75% of MTC cases are sporadic without germline RET mutations.
    Somatic RET mutations occur in 40-50% of sporadic cases. Generally presents
    later than hereditary forms.
pathophysiology:
- name: RET Proto-Oncogene Activation
  description: >-
    Activating mutations in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase lead to constitutive
    kinase activity without ligand binding. This drives downstream signaling
    through RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, promoting C-cell proliferation
    and survival.

  - target: PI3K-AKT Pathway Activation
    description: RET phosphorylation recruits PI3K leading to AKT-mediated survival
- name: RAS-MAPK Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    RET activation stimulates the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, driving
    uncontrolled C-cell proliferation. This pathway is a major effector of
    RET-mediated transformation in MTC.

  description: >-
    RET activation recruits PI3K and activates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
    cascade, promoting C-cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. This
    cooperates with MAPK signaling to drive MTC tumorigenesis.

  notes: >-
    Calcitonin is the primary tumor marker for MTC. Elevated levels indicate
    disease presence, and post-operative normalization suggests complete resection.
    Rising levels after treatment suggest recurrence or residual disease.

    Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is elevated in most patients with MTC and
    correlates with tumor burden. Rapid CEA doubling time suggests aggressive disease.

  - name: Autosomal Dominant
  notes: >-
    RET mutations are present in virtually all hereditary MTC. Common germline
    mutations include C634R (MEN2A), M918T (MEN2B), and others. Somatic RET
    mutations occur in 40-50% of sporadic cases. Genotype-phenotype correlations
    guide timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy.
