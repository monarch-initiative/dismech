    label: pemphigus vulgaris
description: >-
  A potentially life-threatening autoimmune blistering disease caused by
  autoantibodies against desmoglein 3 (and often desmoglein 1), leading to
  loss of keratinocyte adhesion (acantholysis) and intraepidermal blister
  formation. Mucosal involvement often precedes skin lesions.
pathophysiology:
- name: Anti-Desmoglein Autoantibodies
  description: >-
    IgG autoantibodies against desmoglein 3 (mucosal-dominant) and desmoglein 1
    (mucocutaneous) directly cause loss of keratinocyte adhesion. Antibody
    binding triggers intracellular signaling leading to desmosome disassembly.

    snippet: >-
      Auto-Ab against the desmosomal adhesion molecule, desmoglein 3 (Dsg3),
      are critical in the pathogenesis of this disease, since the transfer of
      serum IgG Ab reactive with Dsg3 into newborn mice induces a bullous skin
      disease resembling PV.
    explanation: >-
      Passive transfer experiments demonstrate that anti-Dsg3 IgG autoantibodies
      are directly pathogenic and sufficient to cause pemphigus-like disease.

    snippet: >-
      The most notable biomarkers trends include elevations in IL-4, IL-6,
      IL-17A, anti-Dsg1/3 autoantibodies, and a reduction in Treg cells and
      FOXP3.
    explanation: >-
      Systematic review of 66 studies confirms that anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3
      autoantibodies are the most consistent biomarkers in pemphigus vulgaris.
- name: Acantholysis and Blister Formation
  description: >-
    Loss of desmosomal adhesion causes keratinocytes to detach from each other
    (acantholysis). Suprabasal clefting occurs as basal keratinocytes remain
    attached to the basement membrane while upper layers separate.

    snippet: >-
      Antibody (Ab) binding interferes with the adhesive function of these
      molecules, leading to detachment and subsequently blister formation.
    explanation: >-
      Autoantibody binding directly interferes with the adhesive function of
      desmogleins, resulting in keratinocyte detachment and blister formation.
- name: Signaling-Mediated Cytoskeletal Changes
  description: >-
    Anti-desmoglein antibodies activate p38 MAPK and other signaling pathways,
    causing keratin filament retraction and further weakening of cell-cell
    adhesion independent of direct steric hindrance.

- name: Immune Dysregulation and Th2/Th17 Skewing
  description: >-
    Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by a shift toward Th2 and Th17 cytokine
    profiles with elevated IL-4, IL-6, and IL-17A, along with a marked reduction
    in regulatory T cells (Tregs). This imbalance promotes autoreactive B cell
    activation and pathogenic autoantibody production.

    snippet: >-
      All patients with PV and PF showed significantly (p < 0.000) elevated
      levels of T(H)2 cytokines (IL-10 and IL-4) as compared with healthy
      controls. However, the mean concentration of T(H)1 cytokines (IL-2 and
      IFN-gamma) was significantly decreased in patients as compared to healthy
      individuals.
    explanation: >-
      Cytokine profiling demonstrates a clear Th2 cytokine dominance in PV
      patients with elevated IL-4 and IL-10, supporting the role of Th2-mediated
      immune responses in disease pathogenesis.

    snippet: >-
      The proportion of Treg cells in all PV patients was severely reduced,
      approximately ten times less than controls. These observations were further
      confirmed by both diminished gene and protein expression of Foxp3 in the
      CD4(+)CD25(+) T cell population in PV patients.
    explanation: >-
      Severe reduction in regulatory T cells may contribute to loss of tolerance
      and failure to suppress autoreactive B and T cells in pemphigus vulgaris.

    snippet: >-
      The results of this review support current theories of PV pathogenesis,
      with increased Th2 activity, increased Th17 activity, decreased Treg
      activity, and production of anti-Dsg1/3 autoantibodies being observed.
    explanation: >-
      Systematic review synthesizing 66 studies confirms the Th2/Th17 skewing
      and Treg deficiency as core immunological features of pemphigus vulgaris.

      The involvement of CD4+ T lymphocytes in PV has been suggested by the
