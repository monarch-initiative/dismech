description: >
  Danon disease is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by pathogenic variants in LAMP2
  (lysosome-associated membrane protein 2), leading to defective autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion and accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The
  disease primarily manifests as the triad of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal
  myopathy, and intellectual disability in affected males. Female carriers may develop
  milder cardiac manifestations later in life due to X-chromosome inactivation mosaicism.
  The prognosis is poor in males, with rapid progression towards heart failure, and only
  heart transplantation modifies the disease course.

inheritance:
  - name: X-linked dominant
    description: >
      Danon disease is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait. Males with a single mutant
      allele are severely affected, while female carriers exhibit variable phenotypes due
      to X-chromosome inactivation mosaicism, typically presenting with predominantly
      cardiac manifestations later in life.

        explanation: Confirms X-linked dominant inheritance pattern.

pathophysiology:
  - name: LAMP2 deficiency and impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion
    description: >
      Mutations in LAMP2 lead to deficiency of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2,
      particularly the LAMP-2B isoform which is critical for autophagosome-lysosome
      fusion in cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle. This causes a late-stage block in
      the autophagy pathway, resulting in accumulation of autophagic vacuoles with
      sarcolemmal features (AVSFs) containing glycogen and undegraded cellular debris.

  - name: Impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction
    description: >
      LAMP2 deficiency leads to impaired mitophagy, causing accumulation of damaged
      and depolarized mitochondria. This results in reduced mitochondrial respiration,
      increased reactive oxygen species production, oxidative stress, and ultimately
      contributes to cardiomyocyte injury and arrhythmogenesis.
