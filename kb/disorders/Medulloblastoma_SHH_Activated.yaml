name: Medulloblastoma, SHH-Activated
description: >-
  Medulloblastoma, SHH-activated, is a molecularly defined subgroup of medulloblastoma
  characterized by activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. This
  subgroup represents approximately 30% of medulloblastomas and shows a bimodal age
  distribution, occurring in infants (<3 years) and adults (>16 years) more than
  children. SHH-activated tumors arise from cerebellar granule neuron precursors in
  the external granule layer and can result from mutations in PTCH1, SMO, SUFU, or
  GLI2, as well as MYCN or GLI2 amplification. Under WHO 2021 classification, this
  subgroup is further stratified by TP53 mutation status: SHH-activated and TP53-mutant
  tumors have significantly worse prognosis than TP53-wildtype tumors. SHH pathway
  inhibitors (vismodegib, sonidegib) show activity but resistance develops.

has_subtypes:
- name: SHH-Activated, TP53-Wildtype Medulloblastoma
  description: >-
    The majority of SHH-activated medulloblastomas retain wildtype TP53. Prognosis
    is intermediate between WNT-activated (best) and Group 3 (worst), with
    approximately 70-80% long-term survival. May respond to SHH pathway inhibitors.
- name: SHH-Activated, TP53-Mutant Medulloblastoma
  description: >-
    Approximately 10-15% of SHH-activated medulloblastomas harbor TP53 mutations,
    often associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (germline TP53 mutation). These
    tumors have significantly worse prognosis (approximately 40-50% survival),
    often show large cell/anaplastic histology and chromothripsis.
pathophysiology:
- name: SHH Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    The SHH pathway is activated through loss of function mutations in PTCH1
    (receptor that normally inhibits SMO), activating mutations in SMO, loss of
    SUFU (negative regulator), or amplification of downstream effectors (GLI2,
    MYCN). This leads to constitutive activation of GLI transcription factors.

    snippet: "SHH tumors contain mutations and alterations in GLI1, GLI2, SUFU, and PTCH1 genes, which constitutively activate the SHH pathway."
    explanation: This abstract explicitly states that SHH tumors have GLI1/GLI2/SUFU/PTCH1 alterations that constitutively activate SHH signaling.

  description: >-
    Activated SMO leads to nuclear translocation of GLI transcription factors
    (GLI1, GLI2) which activate target genes including PTCH1 (feedback), GLI1,
    MYCN, CCND1, and BCL2. GLI2 amplification can drive pathway activation
    independently of upstream components.

genetic:
- name: PTCH1
  association: Somatic/Germline Mutation
  notes: >-
    PTCH1 loss-of-function mutations occur in approximately 40-50% of SHH-activated
    medulloblastomas. Germline PTCH1 mutations cause Gorlin syndrome (nevoid basal
    cell carcinoma syndrome) with predisposition to medulloblastoma, basal cell
    carcinomas, and skeletal abnormalities.
- name: SMO
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    SMO activating mutations occur in approximately 10-15% of SHH-activated tumors,
    more common in adults. These mutations can confer resistance to SMO inhibitors
    and are targetable by different therapeutic approaches.
- name: SUFU
  association: Somatic/Germline Mutation
  notes: >-
    SUFU loss-of-function mutations occur in approximately 10% of SHH-activated
    medulloblastomas, particularly in infants. Germline SUFU mutations predispose
    to medulloblastoma. SUFU mutations cause pathway activation downstream of
    SMO, conferring resistance to SMO inhibitors.
- name: GLI2
  association: Amplification
  notes: >-
    GLI2 amplification occurs in approximately 5-10% of SHH-activated tumors and
    is associated with worse prognosis. Causes pathway activation downstream of
    SMO, conferring resistance to SMO inhibitors.
- name: MYCN
  association: Amplification
  notes: >-
    MYCN amplification occurs in approximately 5-10% of SHH-activated tumors,
    often with TP53 mutation. Associated with worse prognosis and large
    cell/anaplastic features.
- name: TP53
  association: Somatic/Germline Mutation
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in approximately 10-15% of SHH-activated medulloblastomas.
    May be germline (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) or somatic. Defines a high-risk
    subgroup with worse prognosis under WHO 2021 classification.
- name: TERT
  association: Promoter Mutation
  notes: >-
    TERT promoter mutations occur in approximately 20-30% of adult SHH-activated
    medulloblastomas and are associated with worse prognosis in adults.

- name: SHH Pathway Inhibitors (Vismodegib/Sonidegib)
  description: >-
    SMO inhibitors show activity in recurrent SHH-activated medulloblastoma with
    upstream pathway mutations (PTCH1). Resistance develops through SMO mutations
    or pathway activation downstream of SMO (GLI amplification, SUFU mutations).
    Growth plate toxicity limits use in children.
  treatment_term:
    preferred_term: pharmacotherapy
    term:
      id: MAXO:0000058
      label: pharmacotherapy
notes: >-
  SHH-activated medulloblastoma has a bimodal age distribution with peaks in
  infants (<3 years) and adults (>16 years). Infant SHH tumors often have
  desmoplastic/nodular or extensive nodularity histology and PTCH1/SUFU mutations
  with favorable prognosis. Adult SHH tumors more often have SMO mutations and
  TERT promoter mutations. TP53 mutation status is the major prognostic factor
  within this subgroup.
