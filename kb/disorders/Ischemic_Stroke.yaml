has_subtypes:
- name: Large Artery Atherosclerosis
  description: Stroke caused by atherosclerotic plaques in major cerebral arteries leading to thrombosis or artery-to-artery embolism.
- name: Cardioembolic Stroke
  description: Stroke resulting from cardiac embolism, commonly associated with atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, or recent myocardial infarction.
- name: Small Vessel Occlusion (Lacunar)
  description: Stroke caused by occlusion of small penetrating arteries, resulting in small subcortical infarcts.
- name: Stroke of Other Determined Etiology
  description: Stroke with an identified cause other than atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, or small vessel disease (e.g., arterial dissection, vasculitis).
- name: Cryptogenic Stroke
  description: Stroke of undetermined cause despite complete evaluation.
pathophysiology:
- name: Arterial Occlusion and Ischemia
  description: >
    Blockage of cerebral arteries by thrombus or embolus leads to cessation of blood
    flow to brain tissue. The affected region is rapidly depleted of oxygen and glucose,
    initiating the ischemic cascade.

notes: >
  Ischemic stroke is a medical emergency requiring rapid evaluation and treatment.
  The concept of "time is brain" emphasizes that approximately 1.9 million neurons
  die every minute during an untreated stroke. Early recognition of stroke symptoms
  (FAST: Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call emergency services)
  and rapid transport to a stroke center are critical. Treatment has evolved dramatically
  with the advent of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, which can
  restore blood flow and minimize brain damage when delivered promptly.
