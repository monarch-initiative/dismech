pathophysiology:
- name: Antibiotic-Induced Microbial Depletion
  description: >
    Broad-spectrum antibiotics (especially fluoroquinolones, clindamycin,
    cephalosporins) cause indiscriminate killing of gut commensals, dramatically
    reducing microbial diversity and biomass. This creates ecological opportunity
    for C. difficile colonization.

        deconjugated secondary bile acids post-FMT.
      explanation: Microbiome disruption alters bile-acid pools; restoration of secondary bile acids is a mechanistic signal of recovery.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28613708
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The most significant risk factor for C difficile infection is broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients can be colonized with C difficile without symptoms, but antibiotic use disturbs the balance of gut flora, enabling C difficile overgrowth and infection."
    explanation: StatPearls notes antibiotic-driven dysbiosis allows C. difficile overgrowth in the colon.

- name: Loss of Colonization Resistance
  description: >
    The healthy microbiome normally prevents C. difficile colonization through
    multiple mechanisms: nutrient competition (especially for proline, amino acids),
    niche exclusion, and production of bacteriocins and antimicrobial peptides.
    Antibiotic disruption removes these competitive barriers.
  notes: >
    Metagenomics studies consistently show CDI patients have depleted Lachnospiraceae,
    Ruminococcaceae, and Collinsella spp. compared to controls. BugSigDB signatures
    for CDI-related studies confirm depletion of these protective taxa. The Lachnospiraceae
    member C. scindens is particularly important for bile acid-mediated resistance.

    explanation: Metagenomic study confirms CDI patients have reduced diversity and depletion of protective Collinsella species compared to healthy controls.

- name: Loss of Secondary Bile Acid Production
  description: >
    Loss of bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria (Clostridium scindens,
    C. hylemonae, and related taxa) prevents conversion of primary bile acids
    (cholate, chenodeoxycholate) to secondary bile acids (deoxycholate,
    lithocholate). Primary bile acids promote C. difficile spore germination;
    secondary bile acids inhibit both germination and vegetative growth.
  notes: >
    The bai (bile acid-inducible) operon encodes the 7α-dehydroxylation pathway.
    ~2mM deoxycholate is sufficient to inhibit C. difficile growth in vitro.

        Intestinal bile acids play an essential role in the Clostridioides difficile
        lifecycle having been shown in vitro to modulate various aspects of
        pathogenesis, including spore germination, vegetative growth, and more recently
        the action of the primary virulence determinant, TcdB.

    snippet: "Inhibition of C. difficile by commensals correlated with the efficient conversion of cholate to deoxycholate, a secondary bile acid that inhibits C. difficile germination, growth, and toxin production."

    snippet: "Amendment of Oligo-MM12 with C. scindens normalized the large intestinal bile acid composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM12, but significantly decreased early large intestinal C. difficile colonization and pathogenesis."
    explanation: Gnotobiotic mouse study demonstrates C. scindens provides colonization resistance through bile acid metabolism.

- name: Bile Acid-Mediated TcdB Buffering Failure
  description: >
    Intestinal bile acids can directly buffer TcdB cytotoxicity. When bile-acid
    buffering is reduced or toxin burden is high, this protection is overcome and
    toxin-mediated epithelial injury proceeds.

        doses of TcdB-typical to those seen during severe C. difficile
        infection-suggesting that the protective properties of intestinal bile acids are
        operant primarily under low to moderate toxin levels.

    explanation: Supports direct bile-acid inhibition of TcdB as a mechanistic modifier of severity.

- name: C. difficile Germination and Expansion
  description: >
    C. difficile spores germinate in the favorable environment created by
