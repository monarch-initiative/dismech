parents:
  - Infectious colitis
  - Healthcare-associated infections
pathophysiology:
  - name: Toxin-mediated colonic injury
    description: >
      C. difficile produces toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) that damage colonic epithelium, causing
      inflammation, fluid secretion, and in severe cases pseudomembranous colitis.
      Disruption of normal gut microbiota, often by antibiotics, allows C. difficile
      to proliferate. The toxins glucosylate Rho-family GTPases, disrupting actin
      cytoskeleton and tight junctions.

  - name: Dysbiosis-mediated colonization
    description: >
      Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis reduces colonization resistance and reshapes bile acid pools,
      enriching primary conjugated bile acids (e.g., taurocholate) that favor spore germination
      while depleting inhibitory secondary bile acids.
