pathophysiology:
- name: Antibiotic-Induced Microbial Depletion
  description: >
    Broad-spectrum antibiotics (especially fluoroquinolones, clindamycin,
    cephalosporins) cause indiscriminate killing of gut commensals, dramatically
    reducing microbial diversity and biomass. This creates ecological opportunity
    for C. difficile colonization.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28613708
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The most significant risk factor for C difficile infection is broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients can be colonized with C difficile without symptoms, but antibiotic use disturbs the balance of gut flora, enabling C difficile overgrowth and infection."
    explanation: StatPearls notes antibiotic-driven dysbiosis allows C. difficile overgrowth in the colon.

- name: Loss of Colonization Resistance
  description: >
    The healthy microbiome normally prevents C. difficile colonization through
    multiple mechanisms: nutrient competition (especially for proline, amino acids),
    niche exclusion, and production of bacteriocins and antimicrobial peptides.
    Antibiotic disruption removes these competitive barriers.
  notes: >
    Metagenomics studies consistently show CDI patients have depleted Lachnospiraceae,
    Ruminococcaceae, and Collinsella spp. compared to controls. BugSigDB signatures
    for CDI-related studies confirm depletion of these protective taxa. The Lachnospiraceae
    member C. scindens is particularly important for bile acid-mediated resistance.

  - target: C. difficile Germination and Expansion
    description: Without competitive exclusion, C. diff spores germinate and vegetative cells proliferate
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26185088
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "A general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high levels."
    explanation: Review describes colonization resistance as a key protective function lost during antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.

    snippet: "The gut microbiota in the Control group showed higher Chao1 index (p < 0.05)... Collinsella_aerofaciens, Collinsella_sp_4_8_47FAA, Collinsella_tanakaei and Collinsella_sp_CAG_166 were enriched in Control."
    explanation: Metagenomic study confirms CDI patients have reduced diversity and depletion of protective Collinsella species compared to healthy controls.

- name: Loss of Secondary Bile Acid Production
  description: >
    Loss of bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria (Clostridium scindens,
    C. hylemonae, and related taxa) prevents conversion of primary bile acids
    (cholate, chenodeoxycholate) to secondary bile acids (deoxycholate,
    lithocholate). Primary bile acids promote C. difficile spore germination;
    secondary bile acids inhibit both germination and vegetative growth.
  notes: >
    The bai (bile acid-inducible) operon encodes the 7α-dehydroxylation pathway.
    ~2mM deoxycholate is sufficient to inhibit C. difficile growth in vitro.

  - target: C. difficile Germination and Expansion
    description: Elevated primary bile acids and depleted secondary bile acids favor spore germination
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:32179626
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Inhibition of C. difficile by commensals correlated with the efficient conversion of cholate to deoxycholate, a secondary bile acid that inhibits C. difficile germination, growth, and toxin production."
    explanation: Study shows bile acid conversion by bai operon-carrying bacteria is key to C. difficile inhibition.
  - reference: PMID:28066726
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Amendment of Oligo-MM12 with C. scindens normalized the large intestinal bile acid composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM12, but significantly decreased early large intestinal C. difficile colonization and pathogenesis."
    explanation: Gnotobiotic mouse study demonstrates C. scindens provides colonization resistance through bile acid metabolism.

- name: C. difficile Germination and Expansion
  description: >
    C. difficile spores germinate in the favorable environment created by
    antibiotic disruption: available nutrients (especially proline), primary
    bile acids, and lack of competition. Vegetative cells proliferate to high
    density, occupying the ecological niche vacated by commensals.

    snippet: "Patients can be colonized with C difficile without symptoms, but antibiotic use disturbs the balance of gut flora, enabling C difficile overgrowth and infection."
    explanation: Antibiotic-disrupted environment permits C. difficile overgrowth from spore to vegetative form.

- name: Toxin Production (TcdA/TcdB)
  description: >
    C. difficile secretes two large clostridial glucosylating toxins: TcdA
    (enterotoxin, 308 kDa) and TcdB (cytotoxin, 270 kDa). Both are
    glucosyltransferases that inactivate Rho family GTPases (Rho, Rac, Cdc42)
    by monoglucosylation of a critical threonine residue, disrupting the
    actin cytoskeleton.

    explanation: Review confirms toxins as major virulence factors causing disease pathology.

- name: Epithelial Cell Death and Barrier Disruption
  description: >
    Toxin-mediated Rho GTPase inactivation causes actin cytoskeleton
    condensation, loss of cell-cell junctions, and epithelial cell rounding
    followed by death. This creates gaps in the epithelial barrier, exposing
    the lamina propria to luminal contents.

  description: >
    TcdA triggers IL-8 and other chemokine release from epithelial cells,
