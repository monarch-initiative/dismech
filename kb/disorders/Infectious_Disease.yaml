    label: infectious disease
description: >-
  Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria,
  viruses, fungi, and parasites.
pathophysiology:
- name: Pathogen Invasion and Replication
  description: >-
    Disease results from invasion and replication of pathogenic organisms in the
    host, triggering host-pathogen interactions that drive tissue injury.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:36675263
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Infectious diseases, which are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, pose a serious threat to humans, animals, and plants"
    explanation: The abstract defines infectious diseases as caused by pathogenic microorganisms.
- name: Host Genetic Susceptibility and Immune Response
  description: >-
    Host genetic factors and immune response pathways influence progression from
    exposure to mild or severe infection and determine disease outcomes.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: immune response
    modifier: ABNORMAL
    term:
      id: GO:0006955
      label: immune response
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:10884944
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "On exposure to a pathogen, a host may resist infection, become subclinically infected, or progress through several stages from mild to severe infection. Chronic sequelae may or may not occur. Host factors, particularly host genes, influence many of these stages."
    explanation: The abstract describes staged progression and host genetic influence on infectious disease outcomes.
- name: Toll-Like Receptor Signaling and Cytokine Release
  description: >-
    Innate immune recognition of bacterial pathogens via toll-like receptors
    triggers cytokine release that supports effective immune responses.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:17280841
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Innate immunity relies on signalling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to alert the immune system of the presence of invading bacteria. TLR activation leads to the release of cytokines that allow for effective innate and adaptive immune responses."
    explanation: The abstract links TLR signaling to cytokine release in bacterial infections.
treatments:
- name: Vaccination
  description: Vaccines are key preventive strategies against infectious pathogens.

      label: vaccination
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:10884944
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Priorities for prevention and control of these pathogens include vaccines and antimicrobial drugs."
    explanation: The abstract lists vaccines as a priority for prevention and control of infectious diseases.
- name: Antimicrobial Therapy
  description: Antimicrobial drugs are used to treat infections caused by pathogens.
  treatment_term:
    preferred_term: pharmacotherapy
    term:
      id: MAXO:0000058
      label: pharmacotherapy
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:10884944
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Priorities for prevention and control of these pathogens include vaccines and antimicrobial drugs."
    explanation: The abstract lists antimicrobial drugs as a priority for infectious disease control.
