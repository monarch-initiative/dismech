name: NTRK Fusion-Positive Cancer
description: >-
  NTRK fusion-positive cancer is a tumor-agnostic molecular diagnosis defined by
  chromosomal rearrangements involving NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 genes encoding neurotrophic
  tyrosine receptor kinases (TRK). These fusions create constitutively active chimeric
  proteins that drive oncogenesis across diverse tumor types. NTRK fusions occur at
  varying frequencies: very common in secretory breast carcinoma and infantile fibrosarcoma
  (>90%), but rare (<1%) in common solid tumors. The development of TRK inhibitors
  larotrectinib and entrectinib represents a paradigm shift in oncology, providing
  highly effective tumor-agnostic targeted therapy based solely on the presence of
  NTRK fusions regardless of tumor histology or site of origin.

has_subtypes:
- name: NTRK1 Fusion-Positive Cancer
  description: >-
    Fusions involving NTRK1 (encoding TRKA) are common in papillary thyroid cancer,
    lung adenocarcinoma, and colorectal cancer. Common fusion partners include TPM3,
    TPR, and LMNA.
- name: NTRK2 Fusion-Positive Cancer
  description: >-
    Fusions involving NTRK2 (encoding TRKB) are less common than NTRK1 or NTRK3
    fusions. Found in various tumor types including gliomas.
- name: NTRK3 Fusion-Positive Cancer
  description: >-
    Fusions involving NTRK3 (encoding TRKC) are characteristic of secretory breast
    carcinoma and infantile fibrosarcoma. ETV6-NTRK3 is the classic fusion in these
    tumors.
pathophysiology:
- name: NTRK Gene Fusion and Constitutive TRK Activation
  description: >-
    Chromosomal rearrangements fuse the kinase domain of NTRK genes with various
    upstream partners that provide dimerization domains. This creates constitutively
    active chimeric TRK proteins that signal independently of neurotrophin ligands.

- name: RAS-MAPK Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    Constitutive TRK activation drives the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade,
    promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation. This is a major effector pathway
    of TRK-mediated oncogenesis.

    TRK activation recruits PI3K and stimulates AKT-mTOR signaling, promoting
    cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. Combined with MAPK activation,
    this drives aggressive tumor growth.
