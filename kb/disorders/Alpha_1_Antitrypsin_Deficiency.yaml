    description: >
      Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is the major inhibitor of neutrophil elastase in the
      lung. Deficiency of AAT leads to unopposed elastase activity, causing progressive
      destruction of alveolar walls and development of emphysema, particularly affecting
      the lower lobes.

      Smoking-related COPD and AAT deficiency both present with emphysema, airway obstruction, and progressive lung disease. The key overlap is that smokers with

notes: >
  Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a rare hereditary condition with significant clinical variability that requires early diagnosis and long-term management.
  Smoking cessation is the single most important intervention as tobacco smoke dramatically accelerates emphysema progression in AAT-deficient individuals.
  The ZZ genotype (homozygous for the Z allele) carries the highest disease risk. Protective threshold AAT levels are typically defined as 57 μM (11 μg/mL);
  individuals below this threshold should be considered for augmentation therapy. Risk of liver disease is further increased by excessive alcohol consumption and obesity,
  so lifestyle modifications are essential. AAT deficiency is associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer; regular surveillance is recommended.
  Heterozygous individuals may still have increased disease risk, particularly with environmental exposures. AAT deficiency can coexist with other genetic conditions
  (such as cystic fibrosis), resulting in more severe disease requiring intensive management. Recent therapeutic advances under investigation include gene therapy,
  induced pluripotent stem cell therapy, and novel approaches targeting AAT polymerization within hepatocytes. Liver transplantation is curative and expanding donor
  pools (including heterozygous donors) improves access to this definitive treatment. Early detection through newborn screening or targeted testing in symptomatic
  individuals is crucial for improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
