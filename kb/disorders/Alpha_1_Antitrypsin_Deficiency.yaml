  - name: Protease-Antiprotease Imbalance in Lung
    description: >
      Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is the major inhibitor of neutrophil elastase in the
      lung. Deficiency of AAT leads to unopposed elastase activity, causing progressive
      destruction of alveolar walls and development of emphysema, particularly affecting
      the lower lobes.

        snippet: "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a relatively common, but under-recognized condition which manifests commonly with liver cirrhosis and emphysema."
        explanation: "This review confirms that emphysema is a common manifestation of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency."

  - name: Hepatic Protein Aggregation
    description: >
      The Z variant of AAT (E342K, PiZZ genotype) causes misfolding of AAT protein in
      hepatocytes. Misfolded AAT accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum, forming
      polymers that cannot be secreted, leading to hepatocyte injury and liver disease.

  - name: Pulmonary Inflammation
    description: >
      Neutrophil recruitment and activation in the lung parenchyma release elastase
      and other proteases. Without adequate AAT inhibition, chronic inflammation
      and tissue destruction ensue, accelerated by smoking and respiratory infections.

phenotypes:
  - name: Emphysema
    description: >
      Progressive destruction of alveolar tissue leading to air trapping, hyperinflation,
      and decreased gas exchange. Characteristically affects the lung bases, unlike
      smoking-related emphysema which affects the upper lobes.
