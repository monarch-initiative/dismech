description: 'Beta-ketothiolase deficiency (BKD) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by biallelic
  pathogenic variants in ACAT1, encoding mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2). The enzyme is required for both isoleucine
  catabolism and ketone body metabolism. Loss of T2 activity blocks the terminal step of isoleucine degradation and impairs
  extrahepatic ketolysis, leading to accumulation of toxic organic acid intermediates. The disorder typically manifests in
  infancy or early childhood with recurrent episodes of ketoacidosis triggered by catabolic stressors such as infection, fasting,
  or ketogenic diet. Between episodes, patients are generally well. Characteristic biochemical markers include elevated urinary
  2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate, tiglylglycine, and 2-methylacetoacetate. The frequency of ketoacidotic episodes tends to decrease
  with age and is rare after age 10. With appropriate management, the prognosis is generally favorable, although neurological
  sequelae including extrapyramidal signs can occur.

    snippet: BKD typically manifests in childhood as recurrent episodes of ketoacidosis, the frequency of which tends to reduce
      with age.
    explanation: Episodic nature triggered by catabolic stress supports the importance of trigger avoidance.
- name: Dietary management
  description: 'Mild protein restriction with avoidance of excess fat intake, regular carbohydrate intake to prevent ketosis,
    and sick-day glucose and electrolyte solutions. The dietary approach is less restrictive than for many other organic acidemias
    due to the generally favorable prognosis.

      label: dietary intervention
  notes: Mild protein restriction and dietary management are standard of care but specific published evidence from the
    available abstracts is limited. The favorable natural history of BKD permits a less restrictive approach than other organic
    acidemias.
- name: Acute crisis management with intravenous dextrose
  description: 'During acute ketoacidotic episodes, intravenous dextrose infusion to suppress ketogenesis (even if euglycemic),
    along with intravenous fluids and electrolyte correction. Bicarbonate may be used for severe acidosis. Severe crises may
    require intensive care with ventilation and dialysis when needed.

    snippet: At the time of admission, the patient had acidosis, drowsiness, and respiratory failure.
    explanation: Documents the severity of acute crisis presentation requiring intensive care, but the abstract does not detail
      the treatment protocol itself.
- name: Carnitine supplementation
  description: 'L-carnitine supplementation may be considered if carnitine deficiency is documented, to support organic acid
    detoxification and excretion via acylcarnitine conjugation.

  notes: L-carnitine supplementation is a standard adjunctive therapy in organic acidemias but direct evidence specific
    to BKD efficacy is limited.
- name: Newborn screening
  description: 'BKD can be detected through expanded newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) via elevated
    C5:1 and C5-OH acylcarnitines. However, screening sensitivity is not 100 percent, and some affected patients may be missed.
    Second-tier genetic testing using NGS panels can reduce false positive rates.

    snippet: The false positive rate for these six conditions after the NGS second-tier test was only 0.017%, and two cases
      of citrullinemia type II would have been missed as false negatives if only biochemical first-tier testing was performed.
    explanation: Documents implementation of NGS second-tier NBS including BKD, reducing false positives.
- name: Genetic counseling
  description: 'Genetic counseling for affected families, including discussion of autosomal recessive inheritance, recurrence
    risk (25%), and carrier testing for informative family members. Prenatal diagnosis is available through molecular analysis
    of ACAT1.

    snippet: By identifying haplotype blocks, founder mutations, and novel pathogenic variants, researchers can significantly
      improve diagnostic precision, enhance genetic counseling, and lay the groundwork for developing targeted therapies.
    explanation: Supports the role of genetic counseling in BKD management and family planning.

    snippet: We recommended carrier testing for all informative family members to recognize mutations in asymptomatic family
      members.
    explanation: Directly recommends carrier testing as part of genetic counseling for BKD families.
- name: HbA1c monitoring for dysglycemia
  description: 'Given the first reported case of persistent diabetes in an adult with BKD, checking HbA1c in people with BKD
    and hyperglycemia is recommended to uncover potential coexisting diabetes and facilitate timely management.

    snippet: This case highlights the importance of checking HbA1c in people with BKD and hyperglycemia in order to uncover
      potential coexisting diabetes, facilitating timely management and preventing complications.
    explanation: Directly supports HbA1c monitoring as a new clinical recommendation for BKD.
notes: 'BKD can clinically mimic diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly in the pediatric setting. Atypical features such as persistent
  acidosis, fluctuating glucose, and normal HbA1c should prompt evaluation for inborn errors of metabolism. The biochemical
  triad (2M3HB, TIG, 2MAA) is not always complete, and MS/MS acylcarnitine screening does not ensure 100 percent sensitivity.
  Even patients with null mutations can show normal urine organic acids and blood acylcarnitines when clinically well.
