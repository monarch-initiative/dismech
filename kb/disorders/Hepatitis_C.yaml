name: Hepatitis C
category: Infectious
description: >
  Hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is primarily
  transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, including injection drug use, unsafe medical
  practices, and rarely through sexual transmission. Acute infection is often asymptomatic
  but progresses to chronic infection in 75-85% of cases. Chronic hepatitis C can lead to
  liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. Direct-acting antiviral
  therapies have revolutionized treatment, with cure rates exceeding 95%.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Viral Replication and Hepatocyte Injury
    description: >
      HCV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that replicates primarily in
      hepatocytes. Viral replication causes direct cytopathic effects and triggers
      immune-mediated hepatocyte destruction. The virus evades immune clearance through
      high mutation rates and quasispecies diversity.

    description: >
      Persistent HCV infection induces chronic hepatic inflammation with infiltration
      of lymphocytes and activation of hepatic stellate cells. This leads to progressive
      fibrosis through excessive collagen deposition, ultimately resulting in cirrhosis.

  - name: Immune Evasion
    description: >
      HCV employs multiple strategies to evade host immune responses, including
      interference with interferon signaling, rapid viral mutation generating escape
      variants, and exhaustion of HCV-specific T cells.
