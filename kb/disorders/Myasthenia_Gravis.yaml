pathophysiology:
- name: Autoantibody-Mediated NMJ Dysfunction
  description: >
    Autoantibodies (primarily anti-AChR) target the postsynaptic membrane at
    neuromuscular junctions. Antibodies cause receptor internalization,
    complement-mediated destruction, and functional blockade, reducing
    acetylcholine signaling efficiency.
