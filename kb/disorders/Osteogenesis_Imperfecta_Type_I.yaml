  Osteogenesis imperfecta type I (OI type I) is the mildest form of osteogenesis
  imperfecta, caused by heterozygous null mutations in COL1A1 leading to quantitative
  deficiency of type I collagen (haploinsufficiency). Affected individuals have
  blue sclerae, mild bone fragility with variable fracture frequency, near-normal
  stature, and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Unlike the more severe OI
  types caused by structural collagen mutations, type I results from reduced
  collagen quantity rather than abnormal collagen structure.

parents:
- Osteogenesis imperfecta
inheritance:
- name: Autosomal Dominant
  description: >
    Autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance but variable expressivity.
    Most cases are inherited from an affected parent; de novo mutations also occur.
pathophysiology:
- name: Type I Collagen Haploinsufficiency
  description: >
    Null mutations in COL1A1 (nonsense, frameshift, splice site mutations causing
    nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) result in ~50% reduction in type I collagen
    production. The collagen that is produced has normal structure, explaining
    the milder phenotype compared to dominant-negative structural mutations.

    snippet: >-
      Dermal fibroblasts from most individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type
      I produce about half the normal amount of type I procollagen, as a result of
      decreased synthesis of one of its constituent chains, pro alpha 1 (I).
    explanation: >-
      Landmark paper demonstrating that OI type I results from 50% reduced type I
      procollagen synthesis due to diminished pro alpha 1(I) chain production.

      COL1A1 haploinsufficiency mutations lead to the mildest form of osteogenesis
      imperfecta (OI), OI type I.
    explanation: >-
      Large clinical study (86 patients) confirming that COL1A1 haploinsufficiency
      specifically causes the mild type I phenotype.
genetic:
- name: COL1A1 Null Mutations
  association: Causative
  notes: >
    Heterozygous null mutations in COL1A1 account for most OI type I cases.
    These include nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and splice site
    mutations that lead to nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant transcript.
    The 50% reduction in collagen quantity produces a milder phenotype than
    structural mutations.

    snippet: >-
      In each case there was marked diminution in steady-state mRNA levels from one
      COL1A1 allele. Loss of an allele through deletion or rearrangement was not the
      cause of the diminished COL1A1 mRNA levels.
    explanation: >-
      Study of 23 individuals from 21 families showed null allele-associated mRNA
      reduction, establishing the molecular basis of COL1A1 haploinsufficiency.

      Analysis of the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes by PCR amplification and scanning by
      conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis identifies only COL1A1 mutations
      in
      15 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta type I.
    explanation: >-
      Demonstrates that OI type I is specifically associated with COL1A1 mutations,
      with common null-allele mutation sequences identified.

    Blue or blue-gray scleral hue is characteristic and persists into adulthood,
    distinguishing type I from type IV OI where sclerae normalize with age.

      The average rate of long-bone fracture (femur, tibia/fibula, humerus, radius/ulna)
