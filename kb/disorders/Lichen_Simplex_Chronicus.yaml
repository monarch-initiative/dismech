pathophysiology:
- name: Itch-scratch cycle
  description: Persistent scratching sustains a neuroimmune itch-scratch cycle
    that drives chronic skin changes.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:40855389
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The hallmark itch-scratch cycle contributes not only to visible skin
      changes but also to substantial sleep disruption, emotional distress, and functional
      impairment."
    explanation: The review identifies the itch-scratch cycle as a central
      driver of chronic disease manifestations.
phenotypes:
- name: Lichenification
  description: Lichenified plaques resulting from persistent scratching.

      label: Lichenification
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:40855389
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), also known as neurodermatitis, is a
      common chronic pruritic dermatosis defined by lichenified plaques resulting
      from persistent scratching."
    explanation: The abstract defines LSC as a pruritic dermatosis with
      lichenified plaques from scratching.
