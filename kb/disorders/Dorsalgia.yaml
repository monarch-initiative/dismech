pathophysiology:
- name: Genetic and disc-related factors in back pain
  description: Genetic variants associated with intervertebral disc disorder
    implicate cartilage, bone, and inflammatory processes in dorsalgia
    susceptibility.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35110524
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Genes implicated by this study are involved in cartilage and bone biology,
      as well as neurological and inflammatory processes."
    explanation: The GWAS links dorsalgia-related loci to cartilage, bone,
      neurologic, and inflammatory pathways.
phenotypes:
- name: Back pain
  description: Persistent pain localized to the back.
  phenotype_term:
    preferred_term: Back pain
    term:
      id: HP:0003418
      label: Back pain
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35110524
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Back pain is a common and debilitating disorder with largely unknown
      underlying biology."
    explanation: The study frames back pain as a common debilitating disorder,
      consistent with dorsalgia.
