pathophysiology:
  - name: STK11 loss-of-function and mTORC1 dysregulation
    description: >
      Biallelic inactivation of STK11 (serine/threonine kinase 11, also known as LKB1) leads to constitutive mTORC1 activation.
      Loss of the LKB1-AMPK axis impairs cellular energy sensing. This results in uncontrolled mTORC1-driven protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and hamartoma formation.
      The polyps are benign but histologically characterized by smooth muscle hypertrophy and abnormal branching of glandular structures.
