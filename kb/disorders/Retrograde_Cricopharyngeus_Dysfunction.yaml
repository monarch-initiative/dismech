pathophysiology:
- name: Failure of Upper Esophageal Sphincter Relaxation
  description: The cricopharyngeus muscle, which constitutes the upper esophageal sphincter, fails to relax in response to retrograde esophageal gaseous distension that normally triggers belching. This is a reflex-specific deficit, as deglutitive (swallowing-related) UES relaxation remains intact.

differential_diagnoses:
- name: Supragastric Belching
  description: Functional belching disorder characterized by repetitive supradiaphragmatic air influx and frequent belches, rather than an inability to vent esophageal gas.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Patients exhibit frequent, often repetitive belching episodes instead of inability to belch.
  - High-resolution manometry shows normal UES relaxation during belches, without trapped gas-related pressure build-up.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38767031
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The incapacity to belch is the hallmark of the disease."
    explanation: R-CPD is defined by inability to belch, distinguishing it from conditions like supragastric belching where belching is frequent.

notes: >
  R-CPD was first formally described as a clinical entity in 2019 by Bastian and Smithson.
  Prior to this, only three case reports existed in the literature of individuals with
  physiologically demonstrated inability to belch. The condition is now recognized as
  more common than previously thought. Many patients retain the ability to belch after
  botulinum toxin treatment beyond the expected pharmacologic duration, suggesting
  reflex reprogramming or central adaptation may occur.
