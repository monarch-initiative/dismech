description: >
  Raynaud disease (primary Raynaud phenomenon) is a vasospastic disorder characterized
  by episodic, excessive vasoconstriction of digital arteries and arterioles triggered
  by cold exposure or emotional stress. It manifests as triphasic color changes of the
  fingers and toes (pallor, cyanosis, erythema) reflecting vasospasm, deoxygenation,
  and reperfusion hyperemia. Primary Raynaud disease occurs without an underlying
  connective tissue disease and involves primarily functional vascular abnormalities.
  Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is associated with autoimmune conditions such as
  systemic sclerosis and involves both functional and structural vascular changes.
  The pathogenesis involves dysregulated neurovascular control, endothelial dysfunction,
  alpha-2C adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction amplified by RhoA/ROCK signaling,
  and impaired nitric oxide-soluble guanylate cyclase-cGMP vasodilatory pathways.

notes: >
  Raynaud phenomenon was first described by the French physician Maurice Raynaud in
  1862. The condition affects approximately 3-5% of the general population with a
  higher prevalence in women. Primary RP is a benign condition with functional vascular
  abnormalities, while secondary RP (associated with systemic sclerosis, SLE, and
  other connective tissue diseases) involves structural vascular changes and risk of
  digital ulcers. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, with nailfold capillaroscopy serving
  as the gold standard for distinguishing primary from secondary RP. Genetic and
  hormonal factors (particularly estrogen) are likely contributors, and GWAS-identified
  genes are enriched in vascular damage and fibrosis pathways.
