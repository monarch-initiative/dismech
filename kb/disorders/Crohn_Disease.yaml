- name: Ileal Crohn's Disease
  description: Involves inflammation of the ileum, the latter part of the small intestine.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:37377591
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: In CD, the ileum is frequently affected and about one third of patients
      presents with a pure ileal type.
    explanation: This reference supports the statement that Crohn's disease involves
      inflammation of the ileum, and specifies this subtype as Ileal Crohn's Disease.
  - reference: PMID:30882291
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Gastroscopy revealed severe aphthous pangastritis with biopsies showing
      a focal active and chronic gastritis with presence of granulomas... coloscopy
      showing an aphthous terminal ileum... concordant with a slightly active, mildly
      chronic terminal ileitis typical for Crohn's disease.
    explanation: This reference supports the claim that Crohn's disease can involve
      the ileum, characterizing it distinctly as terminal ileitis which is a known
      feature of Ileal Crohn's Disease.
  - reference: PMID:31960900
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Crohn''s disease patients with unequivocal imaging findings of ileal
      inflammation at enterography despite negative ileoscopy and biopsy are likely
      to have active inflammatory Crohn''s disease.
    explanation: This reference highlights that Crohn's disease can manifest as inflammation
      of the ileum, aligning with the subtype of Ileal Crohn's Disease.
- name: Colonic Crohn's Disease
  description: Affects the colon (large intestine) with skip lesions.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38437854
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Commonly affecting the terminal ileum and proximal colon, Crohn's disease
      inflammation is often discontinuous and patchy, segmental, and transmural.
    explanation: The literature indicates that Crohn's disease can affect the colon
      and often presents with discontinuous, patchy inflammation. However, it is typically
      not limited to the colon and often involves the terminal ileum.
  - reference: PMID:11271896
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: The site of involvement was the ileum in three patients, the colon in
      one patient and both the ileum and the colon in one patient. Typical small intestinal
      CD occurred in four of seven patients with marked aphthous lesions of the small
      intestine, whereas colonic CD occurred in two of eight patients with such aphthous
      lesions of the colon.
    explanation: This study shows that Crohn's disease can indeed affect the colon
      specifically, supporting the subtype known as Colonic Crohn's Disease.
  - reference: PMID:26906301
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Although ileitis can be seen in HSP, terminal ileitis is virtually pathognomonic
      for Crohn disease.
    explanation: The focus is on terminal ileitis, commonly seen in Crohn’s disease.
      It suggests that Crohn's disease frequently involves the ileum, but does not
      refute that the colon can also be involved.
  - reference: PMID:33278326
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Changes in absorptive capacity and first-pass metabolism in the small
      intestine affect oral drug bioavailability.
    explanation: This study focuses on small intestine involvement in Crohn's disease
      but does not refute colonic involvement with skip lesions.
  - reference: PMID:28379745
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Nearly half (36/73, 49%) of the patients with normal or nonspecific findings
      at ileocolonoscopy had radiologically active disease with a median length of
      SB involvement of 20 cm (range, 1 to > 100 cm).
    explanation: Findings indicate that Crohn's Disease can have varying and discontinuous
      involvement, including potentially just the colon, thereby supporting the subtype.
- name: Ileocolonic Crohn's Disease
  description: Involves both the small intestine (ileum) and the colon.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:33712743
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract; however,
      current European and national guidelines worldwide do not differentiate between
      small-intestinal and colonic Crohn's disease for medical treatment.
    explanation: Although the literature acknowledges different manifestations of
      Crohn's disease involving the ileum and colon, it primarily discusses the broader
      differentiation between small-intestinal and colonic Crohn's Disease without
      naming or detailing specific subtypes such as Ileocolonic Crohn's Disease.
  - reference: PMID:11271896
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: The site of involvement was the ileum in three patients, the colon in
      one patient and both the ileum and the colon in one patient.
    explanation: This provides clinical evidence of Crohn's Disease affecting both
      the ileum and colon in patients but does not explicitly label it as Ileocolonic
      Crohn's Disease.
  - reference: PMID:38294885
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: The terminal ileum and small bowel (SB) are involved in 30-45% of patients
      with Crohn's disease, while 20% have both small and large bowel involvement.
    explanation: This literature reference supports the statement by noting that 20%
      of Crohn's disease cases involve both the small and large intestines, which
      corresponds to the description of Ileocolonic Crohn's Disease.

    snippet: Patients were divided into a derivation (80%) cohort and a validation
      (20%) cohort. The primary outcome was progressive disease... In our final model,
      age at diagnosis older than 60 years was significantly associated with a lower
      risk of developing progressive disease... In patients with CD.
    explanation: The study indicates that younger patients, particularly those aged
      less than 60 years, are at higher risk of developing progressive Crohn's disease.

    supports: REFUTE
    snippet: Logistic regression analysis of the initial characteristics showed that
      the age at diagnosis, gender, initial location and initial extra-intestinal
      manifestation are not associated with the progression of the disease.
    explanation: This study states that the progression of Crohn's disease is not
      linked to the initial age of diagnosis among children and adolescents.
  - reference: PMID:37266570
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: The best predictive model (PREDICT-EPIMAD) included the location at diagnosis,
      pANCA, and 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This model showed good discrimination...
      Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the model.
    explanation: Though the exact age range of 15-35 is not specifically discussed,
      the predictive model includes various factors that can affect disease progression,
      which might encompass age-related variations.

    snippet: Our aim was to identify the phenotype evolution of Crohn's disease over
      time according to the Montreal Classification and to precise predictive factors
      of the need for immunosuppressant treatment or surgery... without association
      with age, sex or smoking habits.
    explanation: This study did not find evidence associating age with the progression
      of Crohn's disease, focusing instead on phenotype and specific disease markers.

- name: Dysregulated Immune Response
  description: The immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract, leading to chronic
    inflammation.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:32242028
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Several factors have been implicated in the cause of Crohn's disease,
      including a dysregulated immune system, an altered microbiota, genetic susceptibility
      and environmental factors, but the cause of the disease remains unknown.
    explanation: The statement is supported as one of the major factors causing Crohn's
      Disease is the dysregulated immune system attacking the gastrointestinal tract.
  - reference: PMID:36720220
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease that is increasing
      in prevalence worldwide. CD is multifactorial, involving the complex interplay
      of genetic, immune, and environmental factors... we mapped markers of disease-associated
      myofibroblast activation and identified CHMP1A, TBX3, and RNF168 as regulators
      of fibrotic complications.
    explanation: This study supports the mechanism involving the immune system leading
      to inflammation and chronic disease in the gastrointestinal tract.
  - reference: PMID:21543977
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: The lymphatic system is re-emerging as a critical player in inflammatory
      and immune processes... Recent studies reporting lymphangitis, lymphangiogenesis,
      bacterial infiltration and lymph node infection, immune cell trafficking, and
      fat-wrapping in Crohn's disease suggest altered lymph drainage and lymphatic
      pumping, implicating the lymphatic system as a likely player in inflammatory
      disorders and IBDs.
    explanation: The literature acknowledges the immune system's involvement in Crohn's
      Disease through various mechanisms, including lymphatic system dysfunction.
- name: Microbiome Imbalance
  description: Alterations in gut microbiota contribute to the disease mechanisms.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:34313550
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Crohn's disease (CD) is a major form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized
      by transmural inflammation along the alimentary tract. Changes in the microbial
      composition and reduction in species diversity are recognized as pivotal hallmarks
      in disease dynamics, challenging the gut barrier function and shaping a pathological
      immune response in genetically influenced subjects.
    explanation: This study details changes in microbial composition and reduction
      in species diversity as key factors in the dynamics of Crohn's Disease, thereby
      supporting the statement.

    snippet: This ileal and colonic defect in innate defence mediated by a deficiency
      of the protective alpha- and beta-defensins may enable the luminal microbes
      to invade the mucosa and trigger the inflammation.
    explanation: This study indicates that defects in innate defense mechanisms allow
      microbial invasion, which triggers inflammation, supporting the involvement
      of microbiota alterations in Crohn's Disease.
  - reference: PMID:23971750
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Inflammatory bowel disease includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      which are both inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Both types
      of inflammatory bowel disease have a complex etiology, resulting from a genetically
      determined susceptibility interacting with environmental factors, including
      the diet and gut microbiota.
    explanation: This article mentions the role of gut microbiota as an environmental
      factor in the etiology of Crohn's Disease, supporting the contribution of microbiome
      imbalance to disease mechanisms.

    snippet: Both under-and over-nutrition are prevalent in patients with Crohn's
      Disease (CD).
    explanation: The study highlights the importance of dietary modifications to manage
      nutritional status in Crohn's disease patients.

    snippet: The primary agents used in the treatment of Crohn's disease are aminosalicylates,
      corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics. Each agent has different roles
      in the induction and maintenance of remission of disease.
    explanation: While this primarily focuses on pharmacologic therapy, it does acknowledge
      the role of different agents in maintaining remission.

    snippet: Although an elemental diet might lead to disease remission, reintroducing
      real foods and sustainable diets in patients with Crohn's disease is currently
      difficult, and would benefit from the sensitivity and rapid feedback provided
      by the field of nutrigenomics.
    explanation: This reference suggests that dietary modifications can lead to remission
      and maintenance of Crohn's disease, validating the role of nutritional therapy.

  - reference: PMID:21901520
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: The indications for surgery include the failure of medical management,
      especially the persistence or worsening of symptoms in spite of proper treatment
      and complications of the disease process. These complications include intestinal
      obstruction, intestinal perforation with fistula formation or abscess, free
      perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, urologic complications, cancer, and
      perianal disease.
    explanation: The excerpt indicates that surgery is reserved for complications
      such as strictures or fistulas among others, thus supporting the statement.
  - reference: PMID:32279173
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Therefore, current therapy of fibrotic strictures relies mainly on endoscopic
      and surgical procedures.
    explanation: The statement mentions surgery for complications like strictures,
      which is supported by the snippet indicating that fibrotic strictures rely on
      surgical procedures for treatment.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Intestinal resection is almost always needed for the closure of symptomatic
      non-perianal fistulas.
    explanation: The statement links surgery to the complication of fistulas, which
      is supported by the snippet explaining the need for intestinal resection to
      manage symptomatic non-perianal fistulas.

    snippet: When isolated to the colon, and patients become medically refractory,
      there are several surgical options - segmental resection, subtotal colectomy
      with ileorectal anastomosis, or a total proctocolectomy and end ileostomy. Unfortunately,
      surgery does not cure CD, and, regardless of the extent of bowel removed, recurrence
      may be seen in the small bowel.
    explanation: The snippet supports the statement by discussing various surgical
      options for patients who are medically refractory, involving the removal of
      affected bowel segments.

    snippet: A partial resection of 3rd and 4th portion of the duodenum and the first
      loop of jejunum was performed, with duodenojejunal anastomosis.
    explanation: The provided case demonstrates a scenario where surgery was performed
      due to refractory disease and complications, supporting the statement.
