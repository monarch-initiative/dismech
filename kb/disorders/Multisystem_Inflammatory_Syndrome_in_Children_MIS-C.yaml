      and innate systems. Certain cytokines, inflammatory markers, and cardiac
      markers assist in the differentiation of MIS-C from other
      hyperinflammatory conditions.

      with end-organ injury and were cannulated to veno-arterial extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) due to cardiogenic shock with arrhythmia.
    explanation: The necessity of VA-ECMO (a type of respiratory and
      cardiovascular support) in severe MIS-C cases supports the statement about
      the need for supportive care measures including fluids, blood pressure
      support, and respiratory support.
