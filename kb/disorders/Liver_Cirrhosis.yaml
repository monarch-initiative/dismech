  description: >
    Chronic liver injury from any cause leads to ongoing hepatocyte death,
    triggering inflammation and regenerative responses that promote fibrosis.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Chronic liver injury leads to liver inflammation and fibrosis (LF) as critical determinants of long-term outcomes such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and mortality."
    explanation: This review establishes that chronic liver injury is the initiating event leading to inflammation and fibrosis in cirrhosis development.
- name: Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation
  description: >
    Quiescent stellate cells transform into myofibroblasts, producing
    excessive collagen and extracellular matrix. This is the central
    event in liver fibrosis.
  cell_types:
  - preferred_term: Hepatic Stellate Cell

      id: CL:0000632
      label: hepatic stellate cell

      label: extracellular matrix organization
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:39063116
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "LF is a wound-healing process characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins due to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In the healthy liver, quiescent HSCs metabolize and store retinoids. Upon fibrogenic activation, quiescent HSCs transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts; lose their vitamin A; upregulate α-smooth muscle actin; and produce proinflammatory soluble mediators, collagens, and inhibitors of ECM degradation. Activated HSCs are the main effector cells during hepatic fibrogenesis."
    explanation: This review definitively establishes HSC activation and transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts as the central mechanism of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
  - reference: PMID:39063116
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The accumulation and activation of profibrogenic macrophages in response to hepatocyte death play a critical role in the initiation of HSC activation and survival."
    explanation: Macrophages play a key role in initiating and maintaining HSC activation, linking hepatocyte injury to stellate cell-mediated fibrosis.
- name: Portal Hypertension
  description: >
    Increased resistance to portal blood flow due to architectural
    distortion and nodule formation. Leads to varices, ascites, and
    splenomegaly.
  cell_types:
  - preferred_term: Endothelial Cell of Hepatic Sinusoid
    term:
      id: CL:1000398
      label: endothelial cell of hepatic sinusoid
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38642564
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Portal hypertension represents the primary non-neoplastic complication of liver cirrhosis and has life-threatening consequences, such as oesophageal variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension occurs due to increased resistance of the cirrhotic liver vasculature to portal blood flow and is further aggravated by the hyperdynamic circulatory syndrome."
    explanation: This comprehensive review establishes portal hypertension as the primary complication of cirrhosis, caused by increased intrahepatic vascular resistance and leading to major clinical complications.
  - reference: PMID:38642564
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Existing knowledge indicates that the profibrogenic phenotype acquired by sinusoidal cells is the initial factor leading to increased hepatic vascular tone and fibrosis, which cause increased vascular resistance and portal hypertension."
    explanation: This identifies the cellular mechanism by which sinusoidal cell dysfunction increases vascular resistance and drives portal hypertension development.
  - reference: PMID:38534382
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Liver cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension (PH) with capillarization of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), although drug treatment options for PH are currently limited."
    explanation: This study demonstrates that LSEC capillarization is a key pathological mechanism contributing to portal hypertension in cirrhosis.
  - reference: PMID:38534382
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Tofogliflozin prevented PH with attenuated intrahepatic vasoconstriction, sinusoidal capillarization, and remodeling independent of glycemic status in CCl4-treated rats."
    explanation: This experimental study demonstrates that preventing LSEC capillarization reduces portal hypertension, confirming the causal role of sinusoidal remodeling in PH development.
- name: Synthetic Dysfunction
  description: >
    Reduced hepatocyte mass impairs production of clotting factors,
    albumin, and other proteins, leading to coagulopathy and hypoalbuminemia.

  - preferred_term: Protein Synthesis
    term:
      id: GO:0006412
      label: translation
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:39063116
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Recent data demonstrated that LF can revert even at advanced stages of cirrhosis if the underlying cause is eliminated, which inhibits the inflammatory and profibrogenic cells."
    explanation: While addressing fibrosis reversibility, this demonstrates that loss of functional hepatocyte mass drives cirrhosis complications, and restoration depends on eliminating ongoing injury.

    snippet: "Portal hypertension occurs due to increased resistance of the cirrhotic liver vasculature to portal blood flow and is further aggravated by the hyperdynamic circulatory syndrome."
