    label: cystic fibrosis
has_subtypes:
- name: Classic CF
  description: Severe disease with pancreatic insufficiency and progressive lung disease.
- name: Atypical CF
  description: Milder phenotype, often pancreatic sufficient, variable lung involvement.
- name: CFTR-Related Metabolic Syndrome
  description: Inconclusive diagnosis with some CFTR dysfunction but not meeting CF criteria.
pathophysiology:
- name: CFTR Dysfunction
  description: >
    Mutations in CFTR gene cause defective chloride channel function.
    Impaired chloride and bicarbonate transport leads to thick, dehydrated
    secretions in airways, pancreas, and other organs.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Chloride Transport
    term:
      id: GO:0006821
      label: chloride transport
- name: Airway Mucus Obstruction
  description: >
    Defective CFTR leads to depleted airway surface liquid and thick mucus.
    Impaired mucociliary clearance causes chronic bacterial infection,
    inflammation, and progressive bronchiectasis.

- name: Pancreatic Insufficiency
  description: >
    Thick secretions obstruct pancreatic ducts, causing autodigestion,
    fibrosis, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Malabsorption of
    fats and fat-soluble vitamins results.
