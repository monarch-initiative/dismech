description: >-
  Cystic fibrosis is a common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder
  caused by mutations in the CFTR gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator, a chloride and bicarbonate channel expressed in epithelial
  cells. CFTR dysfunction leads to dehydrated, viscous secretions in multiple organ
  systems, most critically the airways and pancreas. Nearly 2,000 CFTR variants have
  been identified, with the Phe508del (F508del) mutation present in nearly 90% of
  patients. The disease is characterized by progressive bronchiectasis, chronic
  bacterial lung infection, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, male infertility due
  to congenital bilateral absence of the was deferens, and elevated sweat chloride.
  Multidisciplinary care and CFTR modulator therapies have extended median survival
  beyond 40 years, with the advent of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (Trikafta)
  representing a transformational advance for the majority of patients.

pathophysiology:
- name: CFTR Dysfunction
  description: >-
    Mutations in the CFTR gene cause defective chloride and bicarbonate channel
    function. CFTR is a unique member of the ABC transporter family located
    predominantly in the apical membrane of epithelia where it mediates
    transepithelial salt and liquid movement. Loss of CFTR function leads to
    impaired chloride and bicarbonate secretion across epithelial surfaces
    in the airways, pancreas, intestine, hepatobiliary system, sweat glands,
    and reproductive tract, resulting in dehydrated, acidic secretions.

# CFTR mutation class subtypes
- name: Class I - No Protein Production
  classification: mutation_class
  description: >-
    Nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and canonical splice site mutations
    that result in premature termination codons and no functional CFTR protein
    production due to mRNA degradation via nonsense-mediated decay. Examples include
    G542X, W1282X, R553X, and 621+1G>T. Class I mutations cause severe disease
    with pancreatic insufficiency.
  children:
  - G542X

    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "An effective, although not yet entirely corrective, treatment is available
      for patients with class III mutations, and a treatment with modest effectiveness
      is available for patients who are homozygous for Phe508del, albeit at a very
      high cost."
    explanation: Review discusses CFTR mutation classes and their therapeutic
      implications, establishing the classification system.
- name: Class II - Processing/Trafficking Defect
  classification: mutation_class
  description: >-
    Mutations causing CFTR protein misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum retention, and
    proteasomal degradation. The most important example is F508del, present in nearly
    90% of CF patients. Misfolded protein is recognized by ER quality control and
    targeted for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation, resulting in minimal CFTR at the
    cell surface. Corrector drugs (lumacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor) partially
    rescue F508del trafficking.

      mutation"
    explanation: Confirms the high prevalence of the prototypical Class II
      mutation F508del.
- name: Class III - Gating Defect
  classification: mutation_class
  description: >-
    CFTR protein reaches the cell surface normally but channel gating is severely
    impaired, resulting in very low open probability. The prototypical example is
    G551D. Potentiator drugs (ivacaftor) increase channel open probability and
    produce dramatic clinical benefit.

  - G551D
  - S549N
  - G1244E
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:22047557

    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "The change from baseline through week 24 in the percent of predicted
      FEV(1) was greater by 10.6 percentage points in the ivacaftor group than in
      the placebo group (P<0.001)."
    explanation: Ivacaftor trial in G551D patients demonstrates therapeutic
      targeting of gating mutations.
- name: Class IV - Conductance Defect
  classification: mutation_class
  description: >-
    CFTR reaches the cell surface and channel opens, but chloride conductance
    through the channel pore is reduced. Typically associated with milder phenotype
    and pancreatic sufficiency. Examples include R117H, R334W, and R347P.

    explanation: Review describes mutation class-specific treatments, including
      Class IV conductance defects.
- name: Class V - Reduced Quantity
  classification: mutation_class
  description: >-
    Mutations that reduce the amount of normal CFTR protein produced, such as
    alternative splice site mutations that produce some normal transcript alongside
    aberrant transcript. Typically associated with milder phenotype and pancreatic
    sufficiency. Examples include 3849+10kbC>T and A455E.

    explanation: Review discusses the classification system and mutation
      classes.
- name: Class VI - Decreased Stability
  classification: mutation_class
  description: >-
    CFTR protein reaches the cell surface and functions but has accelerated
    turnover and reduced plasma membrane stability. Rescued F508del protein
    (after corrector therapy) exhibits this additional defect, necessitating
    combination therapy with correctors and potentiators.

- name: CFTR-Related Metabolic Syndrome (CRMS) / CF Screen Positive Inconclusive
    Diagnosis (CFSPID)
  classification: clinical_phenotype
  description: >-
    Designation for infants identified by newborn screening who do not meet
    diagnostic criteria for CF but have some evidence of CFTR dysfunction.
    Defined as either intermediate sweat chloride (30-59 mmol/L) with fewer than
    two CF-causing CFTR mutations, or normal sweat chloride (<30 mmol/L) with
    two CFTR mutations of which at least one has unclear clinical significance.
    A small proportion may evolve to a CF diagnosis over time. Requires longitudinal
    monitoring.

# CFTR-related disorders
- name: Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Was Deferens (CBAVD)
  classification: CFTR_related_disorder
  description: >-
    Isolated congenital bilateral absence of the was deferens causing obstructive
    azoospermia and male infertility, without other features of classic CF. Found
    in approximately 1-2% of infertile males. Most affected men carry at least
    one CFTR mutation, often including the 5T poly-T variant or R117H. Sweat
    chloride is typically normal or borderline. Lung and pancreatic function
    are preserved.
- name: CFTR-Related Pancreatitis
  classification: CFTR_related_disorder
  description: >-
    Recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis in individuals carrying one or two
    CFTR mutations with residual function, without meeting diagnostic criteria
    for CF. CFTR dysfunction impairs bicarbonate secretion in pancreatic ducts,
    predisposing to ductal obstruction and pancreatitis. Sweat chloride is
    typically normal or borderline.
- name: CFTR-Related Disseminated Bronchiectasis
  classification: CFTR_related_disorder
  description: >-
    Diffuse bronchiectasis in individuals carrying CFTR mutations who do not
    meet diagnostic criteria for CF. Sweat chloride may be normal or borderline.
    Represents the milder end of the CFTR dysfunction spectrum affecting
    the airways.
notes: >-
  Cystic fibrosis care has been transformed by CFTR modulator therapy, particularly
  elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (Trikafta), which provides substantial clinical
  benefit for approximately 90% of CF patients. Median survival has increased from
  early childhood death to beyond 40 years, with further improvements expected.
  Multidisciplinary care at specialized CF centers remains essential, encompassing
  pulmonary, nutritional, endocrine, hepatic, and psychosocial aspects. The CF
  Foundation accredits specialized care centers and maintains registries that drive
  quality improvement. Remaining therapeutic challenges include patients with
  nonsense mutations (Class I) not responsive to current modulators, established
  lung damage in older patients, and long-term effects of CFTR modulator therapy.
  Gene therapy and mRNA-based approaches are under active investigation for patients
  with mutations not amenable to small molecule modulation.
