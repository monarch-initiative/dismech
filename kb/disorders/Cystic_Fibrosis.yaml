has_subtypes:
- name: Classic CF
  description: Severe disease with pancreatic insufficiency and progressive lung disease.
- name: Atypical CF
  description: Milder phenotype, often pancreatic sufficient, variable lung involvement.
- name: CFTR-Related Metabolic Syndrome
  description: Inconclusive diagnosis with some CFTR dysfunction but not meeting CF criteria.
pathophysiology:
- name: CFTR Dysfunction
  description: >
    Mutations in CFTR gene cause defective chloride channel function.
    Impaired chloride and bicarbonate transport leads to thick, dehydrated
    secretions in airways, pancreas, and other organs.

    snippet: "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a unique member of the ABC transporter family that forms a novel Cl- channel. It is located predominantly in the apical membrane of epithelia where it mediates transepithelial salt and liquid movement. Dysfunction of CFTR causes the genetic disease cystic fibrosis."
    explanation: Comprehensive review establishes CFTR as chloride channel whose dysfunction causes cystic fibrosis.
- name: Airway Mucus Obstruction
  description: >
    Defective CFTR leads to depleted airway surface liquid and thick mucus.
    Impaired mucociliary clearance causes chronic bacterial infection,
    inflammation, and progressive bronchiectasis.
