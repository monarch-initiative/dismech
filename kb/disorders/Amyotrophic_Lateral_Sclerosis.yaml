has_subtypes:
- name: Familial ALS
  description: Inherited form accounting for approximately 5-10% of cases, with identified genetic mutations.
- name: Sporadic ALS
  description: The most common form with no clear family history, accounting for 90-95% of cases.
- name: Bulbar-onset ALS
  description: Begins with difficulty speaking or swallowing, representing about 25% of cases.
- name: Limb-onset ALS
  description: Begins with weakness in arms or legs, the most common presentation.
prevalence:
- population: Global
  percentage: 0.002-0.003
  notes: Incidence of approximately 2-3 per 100,000 people per year.
progression:
- phase: Early Stage
  notes: Initial symptoms include focal muscle weakness, often in a limb or bulbar region. Fasciculations and muscle cramps are common.
- phase: Middle Stage
  notes: Progressive spread of weakness to other body regions. Increasing difficulty with mobility, speech, and swallowing.
- phase: Late Stage
  notes: Severe paralysis affecting most voluntary muscles. Respiratory failure typically occurs 2-5 years after symptom onset.
pathophysiology:
- name: Motor Neuron Degeneration
  description: >
    Progressive death of upper motor neurons in the motor cortex and lower motor neurons
    in the brainstem and spinal cord leads to muscle weakness, atrophy, and paralysis.
    The selective vulnerability of motor neurons remains a key feature of the disease.
