name: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
category: Complex
description: >
  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive
  neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective death of upper and lower motor
  neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. This leads to progressive muscle weakness,
  atrophy, spasticity, and ultimately respiratory failure. ALS typically presents in adulthood
  with a median survival of 3-5 years from symptom onset. Approximately 5-10% of cases are
  familial, with the remainder being sporadic. A hallmark feature is TDP-43 proteinopathy,
  present in approximately 97% of cases.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Motor Neuron Degeneration
    description: >
      Progressive death of upper motor neurons in the motor cortex and lower motor neurons
      in the brainstem and spinal cord leads to denervation of skeletal muscles. The loss of
      upper motor neurons causes spasticity and hyperreflexia, while lower motor neuron loss
      results in muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations.

        explanation: Single-cell analysis confirms motor neuron vulnerability in ALS and identifies vulnerable populations in cortical layer 5.
  - name: TDP-43 Proteinopathy
    description: >
      Cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) is found in approximately
      97% of ALS cases. TDP-43 normally functions in RNA processing but becomes mislocalized
      from the nucleus to cytoplasmic inclusions, leading to both loss of nuclear function
      and toxic gain of function. This impairs RNA splicing including STMN2.

  - name: C9orf72 Repeat Expansion Toxicity
    description: >
      Hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause
      of ALS, accounting for 40% of familial and 5-10% of sporadic cases. The expansion
      leads to RNA foci formation, dipeptide repeat protein aggregation, and haploinsufficiency.

        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: "Analysis of extended clinical series found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most common genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7%) and familial ALS (23.5%). The repeat expansion leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms."

  - name: Oxidative Stress
    description: >
      Motor neurons are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to high metabolic
      demands. Mutations in SOD1, which encodes superoxide dismutase 1, lead to misfolded
