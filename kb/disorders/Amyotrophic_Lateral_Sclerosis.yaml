  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive
  neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective death of upper and lower motor
  neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. This leads to progressive muscle weakness,
  atrophy, spasticity, and ultimately respiratory failure. ALS typically presents in adulthood
  with a median survival of 3-5 years from symptom onset. Approximately 5-10% of cases are
  familial, with the remainder being sporadic. A hallmark feature is TDP-43 proteinopathy,
  present in approximately 97% of cases.

  description: >
    Progressive death of upper motor neurons in the motor cortex and lower motor neurons
    in the brainstem and spinal cord leads to denervation of skeletal muscles. The loss of
    upper motor neurons causes spasticity and hyperreflexia, while lower motor neuron loss
    results in muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations.

    Cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) is found in approximately

    from the nucleus to cytoplasmic inclusions, leading to both loss of nuclear function
    and toxic gain of function. This impairs RNA splicing including STMN2.
