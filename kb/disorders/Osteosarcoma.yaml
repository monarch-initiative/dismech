description: >-
  Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor, most often
  affecting adolescents and young adults.
pathophysiology:
- name: Malignant Bone-Forming Tumor
  description: >-
    Malignant mesenchymal cells produce osteoid and invade bone, leading to an
    aggressive primary bone cancer.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:41154810
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor, predominantly affecting adolescents and young adults."
    explanation: The abstract defines osteosarcoma as the most common primary malignant bone tumor.
- name: Tumor Immune Microenvironment Remodeling
  description: >-
    Osteosarcoma progression involves interactions with immune cells in the
    tumor microenvironment, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and
    tumor-associated macrophages, alongside immune checkpoint expression.

    snippet: "We discuss classic morphologic and radiographic features alongside recent insights into the tumor microenvironment, including the role of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor-associated macrophages, and immune checkpoint expression."
    explanation: The abstract highlights immune microenvironment components in osteosarcoma.
- name: PI3K/Akt Pathway Hyperactivation
  description: >-
    The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is frequently hyperactivated in osteosarcoma
    and contributes to tumor initiation and progression.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:25704303
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "An increasing body of evidence has shown that this pathway is frequently hyperactivated in OS and contributes to disease initiation and development, including tumorigenesis, proliferation, invasion, cell cycle progression, inhibition of apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis and chemoresistance."
    explanation: The abstract describes PI3K/Akt hyperactivation contributing to osteosarcoma progression.

    snippet: "Despite advances in surgery and multi-agent chemotherapy, survival rates for metastatic or recurrent OS remain poor, highlighting the need for novel prognostic and therapeutic strategies."
    explanation: The abstract references surgery as a standard component of osteosarcoma treatment.
