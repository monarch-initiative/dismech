    snippet: "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) affects half of all patients with heart failure worldwide, is increasing in prevalence, confers substantial morbidity and mortality, and has very few effective treatments."
    explanation: This review discusses the prevalence and severity of HFpEF, a form characterized by diastolic dysfunction rather than systolic dysfunction, demonstrating the importance of both contractile mechanisms in heart failure.
  - reference: PMID:40892534
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Myocardial fibrosis and its surrogate changes in LV structure and geometry lead to functional impairments such as increased diastolic stiffness and elevated filling pressures and are associated with reduced exercise tolerance and poor prognosis in patients with HFpEF."
    explanation: This demonstrates how structural changes lead to diastolic dysfunction and impaired cardiac output, supporting the mechanism of contractile dysfunction in heart failure.
- name: Neurohormonal Activation
  description: >
    Compensatory activation of RAAS and sympathetic nervous system initially
    maintains cardiac output but leads to maladaptive remodeling, sodium
    retention, and progressive dysfunction.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: RAAS Activation
    term:
      id: GO:0002018
      label: renin-angiotensin regulation of aldosterone production
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:37895150
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In patients with heart failure (HF), the neuroendocrine systems of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, are activated to various degrees producing often-observed tachycardia and concomitant increased systemic vascular resistance."
    explanation: This directly confirms the activation of neurohormonal systems (RAAS and SNS) in heart failure patients, supporting the compensatory mechanism described.
  - reference: PMID:37895150
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Furthermore, sustained neurohormonal activation plays a key role in the progression of HF and may be responsible for the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the perpetuation of the pathophysiology and worsening of the HF signs and symptoms."
    explanation: This supports the concept that while initially compensatory, sustained neurohormonal activation leads to maladaptive effects and disease progression.
  - reference: PMID:33432192
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "This multiorgan involvement makes HFpEF difficult to model in experimental animals because the condition is not simply cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension with abnormal myocardial relaxation."
    explanation: This highlights the complexity of neurohormonal effects extending beyond the heart to multiple organ systems in heart failure pathophysiology.
- name: Ventricular Remodeling
  description: >
    Structural changes including ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, and
    fibrosis that initially compensate but eventually worsen heart function.

  - preferred_term: Cardiac Fibroblast
    term:
      id: CL:0002548

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:40892534
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, or diabetes are present in many HFpEF patients and are hypothesized to contribute to adverse cardiac remodelling and myocardial fibrosis through a variety of haemodynamic and metabolic impairments, with nearly half of all HFpEF patients exhibiting left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy or concentric remodelling."
    explanation: This demonstrates the prevalence and mechanisms of ventricular remodeling including hypertrophy and fibrosis in heart failure patients, particularly in HFpEF.
  - reference: PMID:38636927
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Heart failure is usually accompanied by activation of the sympathetic nerve, and excessive activation of the sympathetic nerve promotes cardiac remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. In the isoproterenol (ISO)-induced animal model, it is often accompanied by myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation."
    explanation: This confirms that cardiac remodeling, including hypertrophy and fibrosis, is a key pathophysiological mechanism promoted by sympathetic activation in heart failure.
  - reference: PMID:38636927
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Lilrb4a alleviates cardiac dysfunction and ISO-induced arrhythmogenic remodeling associated with cardiac fibrosis and inflammation through the regulation of NF-κB signaling and MAPK signaling activation."
    explanation: This identifies specific signaling pathways (NF-κB and MAPK) involved in cardiac remodeling and fibrosis, demonstrating the molecular mechanisms underlying structural changes.
- name: Fluid Retention
  description: >
    Impaired sodium excretion leads to volume overload, causing pulmonary
    and peripheral edema. Results from reduced renal perfusion and
    neurohormonal activation.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The pathophysiology between the heart and the kidneys is bidirectional. Common mechanisms leading to the dysfunction of these organs result in a vicious cycle of cardiorenal deterioration."
    explanation: This demonstrates the bidirectional relationship between heart and kidney dysfunction that leads to fluid retention in heart failure through cardiorenal mechanisms.
  - reference: PMID:36769308
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "As the worsening of renal function has an undeniably negative impact on the outcomes in patients with HF, searching for new treatment strategies and identification of biomarkers is necessary."
    explanation: This emphasizes the critical role of renal dysfunction in heart failure pathophysiology and outcomes, supporting the mechanism of fluid retention through impaired kidney function.
