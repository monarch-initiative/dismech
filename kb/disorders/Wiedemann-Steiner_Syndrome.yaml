  - name: KMT2A Haploinsufficiency
    description: >
      Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations
      in the KMT2A gene, which encodes a histone methyltransferase essential for
      regulating gene expression during development. KMT2A catalyzes methylation of
      histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a mark associated with transcriptionally active
      chromatin. Haploinsufficiency of KMT2A results in dysregulated expression of
      developmental genes, particularly those involved in neuronal development and
      skeletal patterning. Transcripts arising from mutant alleles are subject to
      nonsense-mediated decay.

        snippet: "MLL encodes a histone methyltransferase that regulates chromatin-mediated transcription through the catalysis of methylation of histone H3K4. Each of the five mutations is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein product. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transcripts arising from the mutant alleles are subject to nonsense-mediated decay."
        explanation: Original discovery paper confirms KMT2A/MLL encodes a histone methyltransferase and demonstrates haploinsufficiency as the disease mechanism.

        snippet: "we found altered KMT2A target genes expression in patient's fibroblasts compared to controls. Furthermore, we found a disturbed subcellular distribution of KMT2A for the c.3460C>T mutant. Taken together, our results demonstrated the deleterious impact of the splice variant and of the missense variants located at two different functional domains and suggested reduction of KMT2A function as the disease-causing mechanism."
        explanation: Study confirms reduced KMT2A function affects target gene expression, supporting haploinsufficiency mechanism.
  - name: Epigenetic Dysregulation
    description: >
      KMT2A haploinsufficiency leads to global epigenetic changes including reduced DNA
      methylation at numerous loci, particularly at homeobox gene promoters. A distinctive
      DNA methylation episignature has been identified in patients with Wiedemann-Steiner
      syndrome, reflecting widespread disruption of epigenetic regulation.

      - reference: PMID:35163737
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: "The changes in the methylation profile resulting from KMT2A mutations involve global reduction in methylation in various genes, including homeobox gene promoters. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular etiology of WDSTS and explain the broad phenotypic spectrum of the disease."
        explanation: Study demonstrates global DNA methylation changes in WSS patients, providing molecular basis for phenotypic variability.

genetic:

    notes: >
      The syndrome is caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in the KMT2A gene
      (also known as MLL or MLL1), located on chromosome 11q23.3. Most cases are
      due to de novo mutations. Variants include frameshift, nonsense, splice-site,
      and missense mutations, with the majority resulting in loss of function.
