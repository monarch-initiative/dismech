name: Bacterial meningitis
category: Infectious Disease
description: Bacterial meningitis is a severe infection of the meninges caused by
  invasive bacteria that overcome neurovascular barriers and replicate in the cerebrospinal
  fluid. The disease is characterized by robust neuroinflammation that damages brain
  tissue and raises intracranial pressure. Major causative bacteria include Streptococcus
  pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Listeria
  monocytogenes. Pathogenesis involves bacterial entry through the blood-brain barrier
  or blood-CSF barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis or paracellular disruption,
  followed by activation of pattern recognition receptors (TLR2/TLR4), inflammasome
  activation, and breakdown of tight junctions. Clinical manifestations include headache,
  fever, neck stiffness, altered mental status, and in severe cases, seizures and
  focal neurological deficits. Without prompt antibiotic treatment, the case fatality
  rate approaches 70-100%.

    snippet: Most countries had a yearly invasive NmB incidence of less than 2 per
      100,000 people. Within these relatively low incidence rates (compared with common
      causes of invasive bacterial diseases), substantial variation was detected between
      countries, with a notably higher incidence in Australia, Europe, North America,
      and South America. China and India had reports only of sporadic cases, and except
      for South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa showed a near absence of disease.
    explanation: The study highlights substantial variation in NmB incidence between

      respectively, within 3 years of CD diagnosis. Thus, meningococcal vaccination
      rates among patients with CDs need to be improved.
    explanation: Low vaccination rates among patients with complement component deficiencies
      in the US suggest that regions with lower vaccination rates may have higher
      incidences of bacterial meningitis.

    snippet: Coverage of the second dose of MenB vaccine at 12 months was >92% in

      groups. MenB vaccination records for children aged six, 12 and 18 months of
      age from December 2016 to May 2018 were routinely extracted from GP patient
      management systems every month in England via a web-based platform for national
      monitoring of vaccine coverage.
    explanation: This study indicates that while overall vaccination rates may be
      high, there are inequalities in coverage among different population groups,
      which can lead to variable rates of bacterial meningitis.

      bacterial species showed a descending trend. The majority of infected subjects
      are children under five years.

    snippet: During the first pre-vaccination survey, performed during an outbreak
      of meningococcal disease, the carriage rate was high (16%). The carriage rate
      remained high during a second survey made 6 months after a vaccination campaign
      that covered approximately 90% of the study population. A year later very few
      group A meningococcal carriers were found.
    explanation: While the vaccination campaign did not immediately reduce the carriage
      rate, it eventually led to a significant decrease in group A meningococcal carriers,
      indicating that vaccination can influence meningococcal disease rates over time.

- phase: CNS Barrier Penetration
  notes: Bacteria cross the blood-brain barrier or blood-CSF barrier through transcellular
    or paracellular routes. Entry mechanisms include receptor-mediated endocytosis
    (PAFR, PIGR, PECAM1), paracellular disruption via inflammatory signaling (NF-kB,
