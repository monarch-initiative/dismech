name: Bacterial meningitis
category: Infectious Disease
description: Bacterial meningitis is a severe infection of the meninges caused by
  invasive bacteria that overcome neurovascular barriers and replicate in the cerebrospinal
  fluid. The disease is characterized by robust neuroinflammation that damages brain
  tissue and raises intracranial pressure. Major causative bacteria include Streptococcus
  pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Listeria
  monocytogenes. Pathogenesis involves bacterial entry through the blood-brain barrier
  or blood-CSF barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis or paracellular disruption,
  followed by activation of pattern recognition receptors (TLR2/TLR4), inflammasome
  activation, and breakdown of tight junctions. Clinical manifestations include headache,
  fever, neck stiffness, altered mental status, and in severe cases, seizures and
  focal neurological deficits. Without prompt antibiotic treatment, the case fatality
  rate approaches 70-100%.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Most countries had a yearly invasive NmB incidence of less than 2 per
      100,000 people. Within these relatively low incidence rates (compared with common
      causes of invasive bacterial diseases), substantial variation was detected between
      countries, with a notably higher incidence in Australia, Europe, North America,
      and South America. China and India had reports only of sporadic cases, and except
      for South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa showed a near absence of disease.

      respectively, within 3 years of CD diagnosis. Thus, meningococcal vaccination
      rates among patients with CDs need to be improved.
    explanation: Low vaccination rates among patients with complement component deficiencies
      in the US suggest that regions with lower vaccination rates may have higher
      incidences of bacterial meningitis.

      groups. MenB vaccination records for children aged six, 12 and 18 months of
      age from December 2016 to May 2018 were routinely extracted from GP patient
      management systems every month in England via a web-based platform for national
      monitoring of vaccine coverage.
    explanation: This study indicates that while overall vaccination rates may be
      high, there are inequalities in coverage among different population groups,
      which can lead to variable rates of bacterial meningitis.

    snippet: During the first pre-vaccination survey, performed during an outbreak
      of meningococcal disease, the carriage rate was high (16%). The carriage rate
      remained high during a second survey made 6 months after a vaccination campaign
      that covered approximately 90% of the study population. A year later very few
      group A meningococcal carriers were found.
    explanation: While the vaccination campaign did not immediately reduce the carriage
      rate, it eventually led to a significant decrease in group A meningococcal carriers,
      indicating that vaccination can influence meningococcal disease rates over time.

progression:
- phase: Colonization and Bacteremia
  notes: Bacteria colonize the nasopharynx or gut and enter the bloodstream. Initial
    infection often occurs at mucosal surfaces before systemic invasion.
- phase: CNS Barrier Penetration
  notes: Bacteria cross the blood-brain barrier or blood-CSF barrier through transcellular
    or paracellular routes. Entry mechanisms include receptor-mediated endocytosis
    (PAFR, PIGR, PECAM1), paracellular disruption via inflammatory signaling (NF-kB,
    HIF-1a/VEGFA, IL-22/STAT3), or transcytosis across choroid plexus epithelium.
- phase: CSF Proliferation
  notes: Rapid bacterial replication in cerebrospinal fluid where innate defenses
    are limited. CSF has markedly low complement concentrations, enabling rapid pathogen
    expansion.
- phase: Innate Immune Activation
  notes: Pattern recognition receptors (TLR2/TLR4) and inflammasomes (NLRP3) activate
    inflammatory cascades. Both canonical (caspase-1) and non-canonical (caspase-11)
    inflammasome pathways may be activated depending on pathogen.
- phase: Barrier Breakdown and Neuroinflammation
  notes: Tight junction disruption, microglial and astrocyte activation, neutrophil
    recruitment, and complement activation. Mediated by cytokines, chemokines, MMPs,
    and bacterial toxins such as pneumolysin.
- phase: Elevated ICP and Tissue Damage
  notes: Vasogenic and cytotoxic edema lead to increased intracranial pressure, ischemic
    complications, and neuronal injury. Common complications include seizures, altered
    mental status, focal deficits, hearing loss, and hydrocephalus.

    snippet: Many in-vitro and in-vivo analyses have shown that after the disruption
      of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), these pathogens trigger several inflammatory
      pathways including Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signaling in response to Pathogen-Associated
      Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor-mediated
      signaling, pneumolysin related signaling, NF-kappaB signaling and many other
      pathways that lead to pro-inflammatory cascade and subsequent cytokine release
      including interleukine (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-alpha, IL-6, IL-8,
      chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) along with other mediators, leading
      to neuroinflammation.

    immediately after lumbar puncture.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:3287565
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: The available evidence suggests that if bacterial meningitis is suspected
      and LP must be delayed, intravenous antibiotics are warranted before CSF is
      obtained.
    explanation: This suggests that in cases where lumbar puncture (LP) must be delayed,
      antibiotics should be administered before LP, but it does not explicitly state
      that antibiotics should be started immediately after LP.

  description: Corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation and complications, particularly
    in pneumococcal meningitis.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:10830026
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Dexamethasone has been used in a number of clinical trials to moderate
      the host response and to improve neurologic outcome of meningitis. Results of
      six randomized, placebo controlled trials are summarized in this review. Dexamethasone
      treatment did not lower mortality. Only a moderate, but not a significant reduction
      in the neurologic and audiologic sequelae was seen in dexamethasone recipients
      when Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the causative agent of meningitis.
      ... Presently, there is little or no evidence showing a benefit of dexamethasone
      therapy in meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae or N. meningitidis.
    explanation: The statement is partially supported because dexamethasone is used
      to reduce inflammation in bacterial meningitis, but there is limited evidence
      of its benefit in reducing complications, particularly for pneumococcal meningitis.
