  Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized
  by progressive deterioration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It presents
  with prominent changes in personality, behavior, and/or language, typically with onset
  before age 65. FTD is associated with abnormal accumulation of tau or TDP-43 proteins.

pathophysiology:
- name: TDP-43 Proteinopathy
  description: >
    TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is the main ubiquitinated protein
    in tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), accounting for
    over 50% of FTD cases. TDP-43 is typically a nuclear protein, and its aggregation
    and cytoplasmic translocation are thought to represent major pathogenic steps.
    The abnormal accumulation leads to neuronal dysfunction and death.

    snippet: TDP-43 is typically a nuclear protein, and its aggregation and cytoplasmic translocation are thought to represent major steps in the pathogenesis of FTLD due to TDP-43 proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP).
    explanation: This confirms that TDP-43 aggregation and mislocalization are central to the pathogenesis of FTLD-TDP, a major subtype of frontotemporal dementia.
- name: Tau Proteinopathy
  description: >
    FTLD-tau is characterized by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein,
    accounting for approximately 45% of FTD cases. This includes Pick's disease
    with characteristic Pick bodies. The tau pathology disrupts microtubule function
    and causes neuronal degeneration primarily in frontal and temporal regions.

- name: Frontal and Temporal Lobe Atrophy
  description: >
    Progressive neuronal loss and atrophy predominantly affecting the frontal and
    temporal lobes, with patterns varying by genetic subtype. MAPT mutations show
    temporal predominance, while GRN and C9orf72 mutations may show more variable
    patterns. This structural degeneration underlies the behavioral and language deficits.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: MAPT patients were younger than other groups, and showed more frequent behavioural disinhibition, repetitive and stereotyped behaviours, semantic impairment and temporal predominance of atrophy.
    explanation: This demonstrates the genotype-specific patterns of brain atrophy and their relationship to clinical phenotypes in frontotemporal dementia.
- name: Neuronal Death
  description: >
    Progressive loss of neurons in frontal and temporal cortices due to protein
    aggregation toxicity, leading to brain atrophy and functional decline. The
    neurodegeneration progresses over years to decades, with biomarker changes
    detectable up to 30 years before symptom onset in genetic cases.

  evidence:

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: We observed that biological changes and intracortical facilitation transmission abnormalities significantly antecede the emergence of clinical symptoms of at least 3 decades.
    explanation: This shows that neurobiological changes underlying neuronal dysfunction begin decades before clinical symptoms in genetic FTD.
phenotypes:
- category: Neurological
  name: Behavioral Changes
  frequency: VERY_FREQUENT
  diagnostic: true
  notes: Prominent behavioral changes including disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, compulsive behaviors, and dietary changes. Particularly characteristic of behavioral variant FTD.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26473392
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: MAPT patients were younger than other groups, and showed more frequent behavioural disinhibition, repetitive and stereotyped behaviours, semantic impairment and temporal predominance of atrophy.
    explanation: This confirms that behavioral disinhibition and repetitive stereotyped behaviors are core clinical features of genetic FTD, particularly in MAPT mutations.
- category: Neurological
  name: Aphasia
  frequency: VERY_FREQUENT
  diagnostic: true
  notes: Progressive language impairment, particularly non-fluent aphasia in GRN mutations and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia. Language deficits may be the presenting feature.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26473392
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: GRN patients were older at death and more likely to present with non-fluent aphasia.
    explanation: This demonstrates that non-fluent aphasia is a characteristic presenting feature in patients with GRN mutations causing frontotemporal dementia.

- category: Neurological
  name: Personality Changes
  frequency: VERY_FREQUENT
  diagnostic: true
  notes: Progressive changes in personality including social inappropriateness, loss of emotional warmth, and altered social cognition. C9orf72 patients may paradoxically appear socially warm despite other behavioral changes.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26473392
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: They showed more psychotic symptoms and irrational behaviour, yet were more often reported clinically as socially appropriate and warm.
    explanation: This highlights the complex and sometimes paradoxical personality changes in C9orf72-related FTD, where patients may retain apparent social warmth despite significant behavioral dysfunction.

genetic:
- name: MAPT
  association: Mutations cause autosomal dominant FTD with tau pathology
  notes: Microtubule-associated protein tau gene on chromosome 17q21. Mutations lead to FTLD-tau pathology. Patients show earlier onset, prominent behavioral disinhibition, stereotyped behaviors, and temporal lobe predominance of atrophy.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26473392
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: MAPT patients were younger than other groups, and showed more frequent behavioural disinhibition, repetitive and stereotyped behaviours, semantic impairment and temporal predominance of atrophy.
    explanation: This confirms the distinct clinical and anatomical phenotype associated with MAPT mutations in frontotemporal dementia.
- name: GRN
  association: Mutations cause autosomal dominant FTD with TDP-43 pathology
  notes: Progranulin gene on chromosome 17q21. Haploinsufficiency leads to FTLD-TDP pathology. Patients more likely to present with non-fluent aphasia and are older at symptom onset. GRN and C9orf72 are the most frequent genetic causes.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26473392
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: GRN patients were older at death and more likely to present with non-fluent aphasia.
    explanation: This demonstrates the characteristic clinical presentation of GRN-related FTD with language deficits.
  - reference: PMID:30711676
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Presymptomatic carriers of GRN and C9orf72 mutations, the most frequent genetic causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, represent the optimal target population for the development of disease-modifying drugs.
    explanation: This confirms GRN as one of the two most common genetic causes of FTD.
- name: C9orf72
  association: Hexanucleotide repeat expansion causes autosomal dominant FTD, often with ALS
  notes: Hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion on chromosome 9p21. Most common genetic cause of FTD. Causes FTLD-TDP pathology. Unique features include co-occurrence with ALS, psychotic symptoms, and paradoxically preserved social warmth.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26473392
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: C9orf72 patients alone showed a co-occurrence of ALS. They showed more psychotic symptoms and irrational behaviour, yet were more often reported clinically as socially appropriate and warm.
    explanation: This highlights the distinctive clinical features of C9orf72-related FTD including the frequent association with ALS and unique behavioral profile.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Presymptomatic carriers of GRN and C9orf72 mutations, the most frequent genetic causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, represent the optimal target population for the development of disease-modifying drugs.
    explanation: This confirms C9orf72 as one of the most common genetic causes of FTD.
