has_subtypes:
- name: Early-Onset Atopic Dermatitis
  description: Onset in infancy or early childhood, often associated with the atopic march
    progressing to asthma and allergic rhinitis.
- name: Adult-Onset Atopic Dermatitis
  description: First presentation in adulthood, often with different clinical distribution
    and associations compared to childhood-onset disease.
- name: Extrinsic Atopic Dermatitis
  description: Associated with IgE-mediated sensitization to environmental allergens.
    Elevated serum IgE and positive skin prick tests.
- name: Intrinsic Atopic Dermatitis
  description: Without IgE-mediated sensitization. Normal serum IgE levels. Represents
    approximately 20% of cases.
pathophysiology:
- name: Epidermal Barrier Dysfunction
  description: Loss-of-function mutations in filaggrin (FLG) and other barrier proteins
    lead to impaired skin barrier integrity, increased transepidermal water loss, and
    enhanced allergen penetration. This is the primary initiating event in many patients.

    snippet: Filaggrin is a key protein that facilitates terminal differentiation of
      the epidermis and formation of the skin barrier. Here we show that two independent
      loss-of-function genetic variants (R510X and 2282del4) in the gene encoding
      filaggrin (FLG) are very strong predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis.
    explanation: Landmark study establishing FLG loss-of-function as the strongest
      genetic risk factor for atopic dermatitis, with ~9% carrier frequency in Europeans.

    snippet: They are similar in that they are complex inherited diseases involving
      genes that encode immune components and structural proteins that regulate differentiation
      of epidermal cells. Each disease is characterized by proliferation of epidermal
      keratinocytes and abnormal cornification or terminal differentiation in the epidermis
    explanation: Describes the epidermal barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis including
      abnormal cornification and keratinocyte differentiation.
- name: Type 2 Immune Response

    filaggrin and other barrier proteins.
