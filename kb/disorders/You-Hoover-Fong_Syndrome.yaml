description: >
  An autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by biallelic variants
  in TELO2, which encodes a core subunit of the TTT co-chaperone complex essential
  for PIKK (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase) maturation. Clinical
  features include severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, congenital cataracts,
  and variable multisystem involvement.

pathophysiology:
- name: TTT complex dysfunction
  description: >
    Mutations in TELO2 destabilize the TTT co-chaperone complex (TELO2-TTI1-TTI2),
    which is essential for co-translational maturation and stability of PIKKs including
    ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, SMG1, and TRRAP. Loss of TELO2 leads to reduced PIKK
    protein levels, compromising DNA damage checkpoints, growth signaling via mTOR,
    and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay via SMG1.

      Demonstrates that TELO2 plays a conserved role in nonsense-mediated mRNA
      decay, linking the genetic defect to cellular dysfunction.

notes: >
  You-Hoover-Fong syndrome (YHFS) is an extremely rare disorder with fewer than
  50 reported cases. TELO2 is essential for PIKK stability, and its deficiency
  affects multiple cellular pathways including DNA damage response, mTOR signaling,
  and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The link to NMD dysfunction may explain the
  neurodevelopmental phenotype given known associations between NMD defects and
  intellectual disability.
