name: Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Core Binding Factor
description: >-
  Core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia encompasses two favorable-risk
  AML subtypes defined by chromosomal abnormalities affecting the CBF transcription
  factor complex: t(8;21)(q22;q22) creating RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion, and inv(16)(p13.1q22)
  or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) creating CBFB-MYH11 fusion. CBF is essential for definitive
  hematopoiesis, and these fusion proteins act as dominant-negative inhibitors of
  normal CBF function, blocking myeloid differentiation. CBF-AML represents 15-20%
  of adult AML and has favorable prognosis with intensive chemotherapy, particularly
  with high-dose cytarabine consolidation.

has_subtypes:
- name: AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22) RUNX1-RUNX1T1
  description: >-
    AML characterized by the t(8;21) translocation fusing RUNX1 (formerly AML1)
    on chromosome 21 with RUNX1T1 (formerly ETO) on chromosome 8. Typically shows
    maturation to promyelocyte/myelocyte stage. Associated with Auer rods, CD19
    expression, and loss of chromosome Y or del(9q). Favorable prognosis with
    intensive chemotherapy.
- name: AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16) CBFB-MYH11
  description: >-
    AML characterized by inv(16) or t(16;16) fusing CBFB (core binding factor beta)
    with MYH11 (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain). Associated with abnormal bone
    marrow eosinophils containing abnormal granules. Typically presents with younger
    age and may have extramedullary disease. Favorable prognosis.
pathophysiology:
- name: CBF Transcription Factor Complex Disruption
  description: >-
    The core binding factor complex consists of RUNX1 (alpha subunit) and CBFB
    (beta subunit). RUNX1 binds DNA while CBFB stabilizes this binding. Both
    t(8;21) and inv(16) produce fusion proteins that dominantly inhibit normal
    CBF function, disrupting transcription of genes essential for myeloid
    differentiation.

  description: >-
    CBF fusion proteins recruit corepressor complexes including HDACs and NCoR,
    converting CBF from a transcriptional activator to a repressor. This silences
    differentiation genes while partially preserving some myeloid identity,
    resulting in blasts with partial maturation features.

  description: >-
    CBF fusion proteins maintain expression of self-renewal genes while blocking

    CBF fusions to cause overt leukemia.

biochemical:
- name: Cytogenetic Analysis
  notes: >-
    Karyotyping detects t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)(p13.1q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22).
    FISH may be needed for cryptic rearrangements. These findings define the
    diagnosis regardless of blast percentage.
- name: Molecular Fusion Detection
  notes: >-
    RT-PCR detects RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 fusion transcripts, useful for
    diagnosis and minimal residual disease monitoring. MRD assessment guides
    post-remission therapy decisions.
genetic:
- name: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 Fusion
  association: Somatic Oncogenic Fusion
  notes: >-
    The t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation creates a fusion between RUNX1 (AML1)
    on chromosome 21 and RUNX1T1 (ETO) on chromosome 8. The fusion protein
    recruits corepressors, converting CBF to a transcriptional repressor.
    Defines favorable-risk AML.
- name: CBFB-MYH11 Fusion
  association: Somatic Oncogenic Fusion
  notes: >-
    inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) fuses CBFB with MYH11. The fusion
    protein sequesters RUNX1 in the cytoplasm and disrupts normal CBF function.
    Associated with abnormal eosinophils. Defines favorable-risk AML.
- name: KIT
  association: Cooperating Mutation
  notes: >-
    KIT mutations occur in 20-30% of CBF-AML cases, particularly in exon 17.
    May confer adverse prognosis within CBF-AML and represents a potential
    therapeutic target.

  description: >-
    Standard induction with 7 days cytarabine and 3 days anthracycline followed
    by multiple cycles of high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) consolidation. HiDAC is
    particularly effective for CBF-AML and is the standard of care for fit
    patients, achieving 60-70% cure rates without transplant.
