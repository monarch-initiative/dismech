name: Brachydactyly Type A1
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1) is the first recorded Mendelian autosomal dominant
  disorder in humans, originally identified by Farabee in 1903. It is characterized
  by shortening or absence of the middle phalanges. Heterozygous missense mutations
  in the Indian Hedgehog (IHH) gene, which encodes a key signaling molecule in
  endochondral bone development, cause BDA1. The mutations affect multiple levels
  of Hedgehog signaling including protein stability, receptor binding, and
  interaction with extracellular components.

pathophysiology:
  - name: IHH Mutations Disrupting Hedgehog Signaling in Growth Plate
    description: >
      Indian Hedgehog (IHH) is a secreted signaling molecule critical for
      endochondral ossification, regulating chondrocyte proliferation and
      differentiation in the growth plate. BDA1-causing missense mutations
      cluster in the N-terminal signaling domain and affect Hedgehog signaling
      at multiple levels: protein tertiary structure stability (temperature-
      and calcium-dependent), intracellular trafficking and lysosomal
      degradation, binding to the receptor Patched1 (PTC1), and interaction
      with extracellular matrix components such as heparan sulfate.
