name: Diffuse Midline Glioma, H3 K27-Altered
description: >-
  Diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, is a highly aggressive CNS tumor
  predominantly affecting children and young adults, arising in midline structures
  including the pons (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma/DIPG), thalamus, and spinal
  cord. WHO 2021 classification defines this entity by the presence of H3 K27M
  mutation (in H3F3A or HIST1H3B/C) or H3 K27 trimethylation loss through other
  mechanisms (e.g., EZHIP overexpression). The H3 K27M mutation acts as a dominant
  negative, inhibiting PRC2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation and causing global
  epigenetic dysregulation. The tumor is universally WHO grade 4, and the infiltrative
  location typically precludes surgical resection. Prognosis is extremely poor with
  median survival of 9-11 months for DIPG.

has_subtypes:
- name: Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG)
  description: >-
    The most common form, arising in the pons with characteristic diffuse
    infiltration of pontine structures. Presents with classic triad of cranial
    nerve deficits, ataxia, and long tract signs. Diagnosis often made on imaging
    without biopsy. Median survival 9-11 months.
- name: Thalamic H3 K27M-Mutant Glioma
  description: >-
    H3 K27-altered glioma arising in the thalamus. May present with hemiparesis,
    hydrocephalus, or cognitive changes. Bilateral thalamic involvement can occur.
    Slightly better prognosis than DIPG in some series.
- name: Spinal Cord H3 K27M-Mutant Glioma
  description: >-
    H3 K27-altered glioma arising in the spinal cord. Presents with progressive
    myelopathy. May have better prognosis than pontine tumors, particularly with
    focal disease amenable to radiation.
pathophysiology:
- name: H3 K27M Oncohistone Mutation
  description: >-
    Lysine-to-methionine substitution at position 27 of histone H3 (K27M) occurs
    in H3F3A (encoding H3.3) or HIST1H3B/HIST1H3C (encoding H3.1). Despite being
    present in only 5-15% of total H3 molecules, the mutant histone acts as a
    dominant negative, sequestering and inhibiting the PRC2 complex.

    description: Mutant H3 K27M sequesters EZH2/PRC2 complex
- name: PRC2 Complex Inhibition and H3K27me3 Loss
  description: >-
    The H3 K27M mutant histone binds to and inhibits EZH2, the catalytic subunit
    of PRC2, which normally trimethylates H3K27. This results in global loss of
    H3K27me3, a repressive epigenetic mark, leading to aberrant gene activation
    and loss of cell identity.

- name: Epigenetic Derepression and Aberrant Gene Activation
  description: >-
    Global loss of H3K27me3 causes derepression of genes normally silenced during
    development, including proliferative and stemness genes. Paradoxically, some
    loci show retained or increased H3K27me3, suggesting complex redistribution
    rather than simple loss.

genetic:
- name: H3F3A
  association: Somatic Mutation (K27M)
  notes: >-
    H3F3A encodes the replication-independent histone variant H3.3. K27M mutation
    is most common in DIPG (approximately 80%) and thalamic tumors. H3.3 K27M
    is associated with slightly older age at diagnosis (median 6-7 years).
- name: HIST1H3B/HIST1H3C
  association: Somatic Mutation (K27M)
  notes: >-
    HIST1H3B and HIST1H3C encode replication-dependent histone H3.1 variants.
    H3.1 K27M mutations occur in approximately 15% of DIPG, associated with
    younger age, ACVR1 mutations, and slightly better prognosis.
- name: ACVR1
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    ACVR1 (activin A receptor type I, also known as ALK2) mutations occur in
    approximately 20-30% of DIPG, almost exclusively co-occurring with H3.1 K27M.
    These activating mutations drive BMP signaling and are also found in
    fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.
- name: TP53
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in approximately 40-50% of DIPG, often co-occurring
    with H3.3 K27M. Associated with worse prognosis.
- name: PPM1D
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    PPM1D (protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1D) truncating mutations occur
    in approximately 10-15% of DIPG, functionally similar to TP53 loss.
- name: PDGFRA
  association: Amplification/Mutation
  notes: >-
    PDGFRA amplification or activating mutations occur in approximately 30% of
    DIPG. Drives proliferation through RTK signaling.
- name: EZHIP
  association: Overexpression
  notes: >-
    EZHIP (EZH inhibitory protein) overexpression can cause H3K27me3 loss in the
    absence of H3 K27M mutation. Defines a subset of H3 K27-altered tumors that
    lack histone mutations but have similar epigenetic phenotype.
treatments:
- name: Radiation Therapy
  description: >-
    Focal radiation therapy (54-59.4 Gy) is the only treatment with established
    benefit, providing temporary tumor control and symptom improvement. Typically
    extends survival by 2-3 months compared to supportive care alone.

  The WHO 2021 classification expanded this entity from H3 K27M-mutant to H3 K27-altered
  to include tumors with H3K27me3 loss through other mechanisms (e.g., EZHIP
  overexpression) that share similar biology and prognosis. Diagnosis requires
  demonstration of H3 K27M mutation by immunohistochemistry or sequencing, or
  loss of H3K27me3 with EZHIP overexpression.
