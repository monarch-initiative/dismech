description: >-
  FGFR-altered cholangiocarcinoma is a molecularly defined subtype of intrahepatic
  cholangiocarcinoma characterized by fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) alterations,
  primarily FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements. FGFR2 fusions occur in approximately 10-15%
  of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and represent actionable targets. Multiple fusion
  partners have been identified, with BICC1, PPHLN1, and AHCYL1 being most common. FGFR
  inhibitors pemigatinib, futibatinib, and infigratinib have demonstrated significant
  activity in FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma, establishing these as standard
  therapies for this molecularly defined subset.

pathophysiology:
- name: FGFR2 Fusion and Constitutive Activation
  description: >-
    FGFR2 fusions join the FGFR2 kinase domain to various partner genes (BICC1, PPHLN1,
    AHCYL1, and others). Partner genes typically provide oligomerization domains that
    cause ligand-independent FGFR2 dimerization and constitutive kinase activation.
    This drives oncogenic signaling through multiple downstream pathways.

  description: >-
    FGFR2 activation leads to recruitment of adaptor proteins (FRS2, GRB2) that activate
    RAS and the downstream MAPK cascade. This drives transcription of genes promoting
    cell proliferation.

    description: MAPK signaling promotes cell cycle progression
- name: PI3K-AKT Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    FGFR2 signaling activates PI3K through adaptor proteins, leading to AKT phosphorylation.
    This promotes cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. PI3K pathway activation may
    contribute to resistance to FGFR inhibitors.

  description: >-
    FGFR2 directly phosphorylates phospholipase C gamma, leading to protein kinase C
    activation. This pathway contributes to cell migration, invasion, and other aspects
    of the transformed phenotype.
- name: Enhanced Cell Proliferation
  description: >-
    Combined activation of MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and PLCgamma pathways drives enhanced cell
    proliferation. FGFR2 fusion-positive tumors are dependent on FGFR2 signaling, making
    them vulnerable to FGFR inhibition.

- name: FGFR2 Mutations/Amplifications
  association: Somatic Alterations
  notes: >-
    Activating FGFR2 point mutations and amplifications are less common than fusions
    but may also respond to FGFR inhibitors. V564F/I gatekeeper mutations are associated
    with acquired resistance.
- name: FGFR Resistance Mutations
  association: Secondary Resistance
  notes: >-
    Acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors often involves secondary FGFR2 kinase domain
    mutations (V564F, N549H/K, E565A, L617V, K659M). Polyclonal resistance is common.
    Monitoring for resistance mutations helps guide subsequent therapy.
