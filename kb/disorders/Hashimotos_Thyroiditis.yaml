- name: Autoimmune Thyroid Destruction
  description: >
    T cell-mediated and antibody-mediated destruction of thyroid follicular
    cells leads to progressive loss of thyroid function. Anti-thyroid
    peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are characteristic.

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "We identify damaged antigen-presenting TFCs with upregulated CD74 and MIF expression in thyroid samples from AITD patients."
    explanation: Spatial transcriptomics demonstrates that thyroid follicular cells actively participate in autoimmune destruction by presenting antigens via CD74/MIF upregulation.

    snippet: "Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is generally characterized by the presence of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, with a concomitant infiltration of lymphocytes in the thyroid."
    explanation: Confirms the characteristic antibody profile and lymphocytic infiltration pattern in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
  - reference: PMID:40535343
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Through this review, we aim to establish mechanistic connections between ICI pharmacodynamics and thyroid tissue immunopathology."
    explanation: ICI-induced thyroiditis provides a mechanistic model that mirrors the autoimmune destruction seen in spontaneous Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
- name: Lymphocytic Infiltration
  description: >
    Dense lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland with germinal
    center formation. CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells accumulate
    in the thyroid parenchyma.

    snippet: "Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is generally characterized by the presence of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, with a concomitant infiltration of lymphocytes in the thyroid."
    explanation: Lymphocytic infiltration is a defining histological feature of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
  - reference: PMID:39003267
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the molecular architecture, heterogeneity and location of different cells present in the thyroid tissue, including thyroid follicular cells (TFCs), stromal cells such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and thyroid infiltrating lymphocytes."
    explanation: Spatial analysis confirms the presence and organization of infiltrating lymphocytes in the thyroid microenvironment.
- name: Thyroid Hormone Deficiency
  description: >
    Progressive destruction of thyroid tissue leads to decreased
    production of T3 and T4, resulting in hypothyroidism with elevated
    TSH through negative feedback.

  - preferred_term: Thyroid Hormone Synthesis
    term:
      id: GO:0006590
      label: thyroid hormone generation
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38731922
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Due to the progressive destruction of cells, AITD can lead to subclinical or overt hypothyroidism."
    explanation: Progressive thyroid destruction in Hashimoto's thyroiditis results in hypothyroidism through loss of hormone-producing cells.
  - reference: PMID:40535343
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ICI-induced thyroiditis represents a critical step toward developing evidence-based diagnostic protocols and targeted therapeutic interventions for cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy."
    explanation: Mechanistic understanding of immune-mediated thyroid destruction links to hormone deficiency in both ICI-induced and spontaneous thyroiditis.
