description: 'Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of mitochondrial
  long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in HADHA, most commonly the c.1528G>C (p.Glu510Gln)
  founder mutation. LCHADD selectively impairs the LCHAD catalytic activity within the mitochondrial trifunctional protein
  (MTP/TFP), leading to energy failure during fasting or physiologic stress and accumulation of toxic long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl
  intermediates. Clinical manifestations include hypoketotic hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatopathy, peripheral
  neuropathy, and a distinctive progressive chorioretinopathy not seen in other fatty acid oxidation disorders. Despite improved
  neonatal survival through newborn screening, long-term morbidity remains substantial, with myopathy in 82%, metabolic decompensations
  in 80%, and cardiomyopathy in 28% of screened individuals.

notes: 'LCHADD is distinguished from the broader mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency (MTPD) by the selective impairment
  of LCHAD activity due to the common HADHA c.1528G>C variant. MTPD involves additional loss of enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-ketoacyl-CoA
  thiolase activities due to other HADHA or HADHB variants. An association between fetal LCHAD/MTP deficiency and maternal
  acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) or HELLP syndrome has been described, attributed to toxic 3-hydroxy intermediate metabolites
  released from the deficient placenta into maternal circulation. Emerging 2024 research demonstrates a gene therapy approach
  using AAV-HADHA to rescue RPE cell phenotypes, providing preclinical rationale for retinal gene-addition therapy.
