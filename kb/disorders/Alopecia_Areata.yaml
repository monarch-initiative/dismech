description: >-
  An autoimmune disease targeting hair follicles, resulting in non-scarring
  hair loss. Ranges from patchy hair loss to complete scalp (alopecia totalis)
  or body hair loss (alopecia universalis). Hair follicles retain regenerative
  capacity, allowing potential regrowth.
pathophysiology:
- name: Loss of Hair Follicle Immune Privilege
  description: >-
    Hair follicles normally maintain immune privilege through low MHC class I
    expression and local immunosuppressive factors. Collapse of immune privilege
    exposes hair follicle antigens to immune surveillance.

    snippet: >-
      Anagen stage hair follicles (HFs) exhibit "immune privilege (IP)" from the level
      of the bulge downwards to the bulb. Both passive and active IP mechanisms
      protect HFs from physiologically undesired immune responses and limit immune
      surveillance. IP is relative, not absolute, and is primarily based on absent, or
      greatly reduced, intra-follicular antigen presentation via MHC class I and II
      molecules, along with prominent expression of "no danger" signals like CD200 and
      the creation of an immunoinhibitory signalling milieu generated by the secretory
      activities of HFs.
    explanation: >-
      This review describes the mechanisms of hair follicle immune privilege including
      reduced MHC expression and immunosuppressive signaling, confirming the normal
      maintenance of immune privilege in anagen hair follicles.

    snippet: >-
      Immune privilege collapse has been extensively investigated in AA pathogenesis,
      including the suppression of immunomodulatory factors (e.g., transforming growth
      factor-β (TGF-β), programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1), interleukin-10 (IL-10),
      α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), and macrophage migration inhibitory
      factor (MIF)) and enhanced expression of the major histocompatibility complex
      (MHC) throughout hair follicles.
    explanation: >-
      This study documents the specific immunomodulatory factors that are suppressed
      during immune privilege collapse in AA, along with enhanced MHC expression that
      enables autoreactive T cell recognition.
- name: CD8+ T Cell-Mediated Attack
  description: >-
    NKG2D-expressing CD8+ T cells infiltrate the hair bulb and attack
    hair follicle cells. IFN-gamma produced by these cells induces MHC class I
    upregulation and further T cell recruitment.

    snippet: >-
      In AA, lesional HFs are rapidly infiltrated by NKG2D + T cells and natural
      killer (NK) cells, while perifollicular mast cells acquire a profoundly
      pro-inflammatory phenotype and interact with autoreactive CD8+ T cells. Using
      animal models, significant functional evidence has accumulated that demonstrates
      the dominance of the immune system in AA pathogenesis. Purified CD8+T-cell and
      NK cell populations alone, which secrete fγ, suffice to induce the AA phenotype,
      while CD4+T-cells aggravate it, and Tregs and iNKT cells may provide relative
      protection against AA development.
    explanation: >-
      This demonstrates that CD8+ T cells alone are sufficient to induce alopecia
      areata in animal models, establishing their central role as disease drivers.
      The NKG2D+ phenotype and IFN-gamma production are key features.

      Pathogenic activity of CD44s-hiCD49dlo CD8+ T cells was mediated by NKG2D-dependent
      innate-like cytotoxicity, which was further augmented by IL-15 stimulation and
      triggered disease onset.
    explanation: >-
      This identifies the specific mechanism of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity in AA through
      NKG2D-dependent pathways, and demonstrates that IL-15 stimulation enhances their
      pathogenic activity.
- name: JAK-STAT Signaling Activation
  description: >-
    IFN-gamma signaling through JAK1/2-STAT1 pathway drives disease
    pathogenesis. This pathway is a key therapeutic target, with JAK
    inhibitors showing efficacy in alopecia areata.

    snippet: >-
      Both AA and vitiligo are autoimmune diseases that share commonalities in
      pathogenesis, including the involvement of plasmacytoid dendritic cells
      (and interferon-α (IFN- α) signaling pathways) and cytotoxic CD8+ T
      lymphocytes (and activated IFN-γ signaling pathways).
    explanation: >-
      This establishes that IFN-gamma signaling pathways are activated in AA
      pathogenesis, providing the mechanistic basis for JAK-STAT pathway involvement
      since these cytokines signal through JAK-STAT.

      In two pivotal placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials in adults
      with severe alopecia areata, oral baricitinib once daily was associated with
      clinically meaningful scalp, eyebrow, and eyelash hair regrowth over 36 weeks.
    explanation: >-
      The clinical efficacy of baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, in promoting hair
      regrowth provides direct evidence that the JAK-STAT pathway is a critical
      therapeutic target in AA pathogenesis.

      Interferon-γ (IFNγ) treatment increased the secretion of CXCL12 from DFs through
      the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, and
      αCXCL12 treatment protected the hair follicle from IFNγ in hair organ culture.
    explanation: >-
      This demonstrates that IFN-gamma signals through STAT3 to drive pathogenic
      chemokine production, providing direct mechanistic evidence for JAK-STAT
      pathway activation in AA.
- name: Chemokine-Mediated Immune Cell Recruitment
  description: >-
    CXCL12 and other chemokines recruit and activate CD8+ T cells to the hair
    follicle. IFN-gamma induces CXCL12 production from dermal fibroblasts,
    amplifying immune cell infiltration and contributing to disease progression.

      CXCL12 expression is increased in AA mice, while s.c. injection of
      αCXCL12 significantly inhibited hair loss in AA mice and reduced the number of
      CD8+, MHC-I+, and MHC-II+ cells in the skin. In addition, injection of αCXCL12
      also prevented the onset of AA and reduced the number of CD8+ cells.
    explanation: >-
      This demonstrates that CXCL12 drives CD8+ T cell recruitment to hair follicles,
      and blocking this chemokine can prevent disease onset and reduce immune cell
      infiltration in AA.

      Blood chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 9 (CXCL9) and CXCL10 are elevated in both
      diseases.
    explanation: >-
      Elevated CXCL9 and CXCL10 chemokines in AA blood support the role of
      chemokine-mediated immune cell recruitment in disease pathogenesis.

      Collapse of anagen hair bulb IP is an essential prerequisite for the development
      of alopecia areata (AA). In AA, lesional HFs are rapidly infiltrated by NKG2D + T
      cells and natural killer (NK) cells, while perifollicular mast cells acquire a
      profoundly pro-inflammatory phenotype and interact with autoreactive CD8+ T cells.
    explanation: >-
      While this reference focuses on hair follicle pathology, the immune mechanisms
      described also affect nail matrix, explaining the nail changes seen in AA patients.
