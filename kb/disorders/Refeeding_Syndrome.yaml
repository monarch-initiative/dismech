      be considered when evaluating electrolyte disturbances.
    distinguishing_features:
      - Exacerbations are driven by acute airway inflammation rather than refeeding after starvation.

        snippet: "Phosphate measurement to evaluate acute hypophosphatemia is advised in high-risk settings: refeeding syndrome, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome, alcoholic ketoacidosis, worsening COPD or asthma exacerbations."
        explanation: This identifies asthma exacerbations as a high-risk setting for acute hypophosphatemia.

      - reference: clinicaltrials:NCT02488109
        supports: SUPPORT
        evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
        snippet: The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of lower calorie refeeding versus higher calorie refeeding in hospitalized adolescents with anorexia nervosa.
        explanation: This trial evaluates refeeding strategies relevant to preventing refeeding complications.

    description: Trial comparing individualized caloric refeeding to higher calorie refeeding in hospitalized patients with atypical anorexia nervosa.
    evidence:
      - reference: clinicaltrials:NCT04966858
        supports: SUPPORT
        evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
        snippet: The primary purpose of the trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of Individualized Caloric Refeeding (ICR) to the new standard of care, Higher Calorie Refeeding (HCR), in hospitalized patients with atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN), and clinical remission over one year of follow-up.
        explanation: This trial directly compares refeeding protocols in a high-risk malnourished population.
