    calorie refeeding in hospitalized patients with atypical anorexia nervosa.
  evidence:
  - reference: clinicaltrials:NCT04966858
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: The primary purpose of the trial is to compare the efficacy and
      safety of Individualized Caloric Refeeding (ICR) to the new standard of
      care, Higher Calorie Refeeding (HCR), in hospitalized patients with
      atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN), and clinical remission over one year of
      follow-up.
    explanation: This trial directly compares refeeding protocols in a high-risk
      malnourished population.
