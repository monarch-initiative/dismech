description: >
  Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in GLA that reduce or abolish
  α-galactosidase A activity, leading to lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids, principally globotriaosylceramide
  (Gb3) and its deacylated derivative globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3). Substrate accumulation initiates a network of
  cellular stress responses including endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
  activation of innate immune pathways, leading to progressive organ damage in kidney, heart, vasculature, and nervous system.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A deficiency and Gb3 accumulation
    description: >
      GLA mutations reduce or abolish α-galactosidase A enzyme activity, causing accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)
      and its deacylated form lyso-Gb3 in lysosomes. Lyso-Gb3 is closely associated with disease severity and exerts direct
      cytotoxic effects on podocytes, neurons, and other cell types. Substrate accumulation initiates lysosomal dysfunction
      with impaired autophagy and reduced ATP production.

      **Key Distinguishing Features for Fabry Disease:**
      - Acrodystrophic neuropathic pain and pain crises are characteristic of Fabry disease, not Chagas disease
      - Angiokeratomas and cornea verticillata are pathognomonic for Fabry disease
      - Renal involvement with progressive proteinuria and CKD typical of Fabry disease is absent in Chagas disease
      - Geographic/epidemiological risk: Chagas disease in endemic areas of Central/South America; Fabry disease worldwide with X-linked inheritance
      - Gastrointestinal involvement (megaesophagus, megacolon) typical of Chagas disease not seen in Fabry disease
      - Serological testing for Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas) vs genetic GLA testing (Fabry disease) provides definitive diagnosis

    description: >
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can involve heart (cardiac sarcoidosis), kidneys, nervous system, and skin,
      creating potential overlap with Fabry disease systemic manifestations. Both can cause cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities,
      renal disease, and neuropathy. Cardiac sarcoidosis with LGE on imaging can superficially resemble Fabry disease cardiomyopathy.
      Neurological involvement (stroke, neuropathy) occurs in both conditions.

      **Key Distinguishing Features for Fabry Disease:**
      - Acrodystrophic neuropathic pain with pain crises is characteristic of Fabry disease (sarcoidosis causes other neuropathy types)
      - Angiokeratomas and cornea verticillata are pathognomonic for Fabry disease
      - Pulmonary involvement with hilar lymphadenopathy typical of sarcoidosis absent in Fabry disease
      - Cutaneous manifestations differ: angiokeratomas (Fabry) vs erythema nodosum/lupus pernio (sarcoidosis)
      - Calcium metabolism abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria) typical of sarcoidosis absent in Fabry disease
      - Elevated lyso-Gb3 biomarker diagnostic for Fabry disease; elevated ACE and calcium in sarcoidosis
      - Skin/conjunctival biopsy showing granulomas (sarcoidosis) vs genetic GLA testing (Fabry disease)

  Early diagnosis and treatment initiation are critical for improving outcomes. Progressive organ damage despite enzyme replacement
  therapy suggests ongoing pathogenic mechanisms beyond lipid substrate, including persistent inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis,
  and α-synuclein-mediated lysosomal toxicity. Multi-targeted therapeutic approaches may be needed to address these diverse mechanisms.
