description: >
  Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in GLA that reduce or abolish
  α-galactosidase A activity, leading to lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids, principally globotriaosylceramide
  (Gb3) and its deacylated derivative globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3). Substrate accumulation initiates a network of
  cellular stress responses including endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
  activation of innate immune pathways, leading to progressive organ damage in kidney, heart, vasculature, and nervous system.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A deficiency and Gb3 accumulation
    description: >
      GLA mutations reduce or abolish α-galactosidase A enzyme activity, causing accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)
      and its deacylated form lyso-Gb3 in lysosomes. Lyso-Gb3 is closely associated with disease severity and exerts direct
      cytotoxic effects on podocytes, neurons, and other cell types. Substrate accumulation initiates lysosomal dysfunction
      with impaired autophagy and reduced ATP production.

      - Family history showing X-linked inheritance pattern indicates Fabry disease, whereas primary myocarditis typically presents sporadically
      - Left ventricular hypertrophy pattern is characteristic of Fabry disease, while acute myocarditis presents with dilated cardiomyopathy
      - Prodromal viral illness preceding acute myocarditis is typically absent in Fabry disease

        label: Chagas disease
    description: >
      Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, can present with cardiac manifestations including cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and
      sudden cardiac death, overlapping with Fabry disease cardiac phenotypes. Both can cause left ventricular dysfunction and conduction
      abnormalities. Chronic Chagas disease produces cardiomyopathy with LGE patterns that can mimic Fabry disease. However, systemic
      manifestations differ significantly.
    distinguishing_features:
      - Acrodystrophic neuropathic pain and pain crises are characteristic of Fabry disease but not seen in Chagas disease
      - Angiokeratomas and cornea verticillata are pathognomonic for Fabry disease
      - Renal involvement with progressive proteinuria and chronic kidney disease is typical of Fabry disease but absent in Chagas disease
      - Geographic/epidemiological risk differs (Chagas disease endemic to Central/South America; Fabry disease worldwide with X-linked inheritance)
      - Gastrointestinal involvement (megaesophagus, megacolon) is typical of Chagas disease but not seen in Fabry disease
      - Serological testing for Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies versus genetic testing for GLA mutations provides definitive diagnosis

        label: sarcoidosis
    description: >
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can involve heart (cardiac sarcoidosis), kidneys, nervous system, and skin,
      creating potential overlap with Fabry disease systemic manifestations. Both can cause cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities,
      renal disease, and neuropathy. Cardiac sarcoidosis with LGE on imaging can superficially resemble Fabry disease cardiomyopathy.
      Neurological involvement (stroke, neuropathy) occurs in both conditions.
    distinguishing_features:
      - Acrodystrophic neuropathic pain with pain crises is characteristic of Fabry disease, whereas sarcoidosis causes other neuropathy types
      - Angiokeratomas and cornea verticillata are pathognomonic for Fabry disease and absent in sarcoidosis
      - Pulmonary involvement with hilar lymphadenopathy is typical of sarcoidosis but absent in Fabry disease
      - Cutaneous manifestations differ (angiokeratomas in Fabry disease versus erythema nodosum or lupus pernio in sarcoidosis)
      - Calcium metabolism abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria) are typical of sarcoidosis but absent in Fabry disease
      - Elevated lyso-Gb3 biomarker is diagnostic for Fabry disease, while elevated ACE and serum calcium suggest sarcoidosis
      - Skin or conjunctival biopsy showing granulomas versus genetic testing for GLA mutations provides definitive diagnosis
