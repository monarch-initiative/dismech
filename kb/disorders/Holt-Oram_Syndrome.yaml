name: Holt-Oram Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is an autosomal dominant heart-hand syndrome caused by
  mutations in TBX5, a T-box transcription factor critical for upper limb and cardiac
  development. It is characterized by preaxial radial ray upper limb malformations
  (ranging from triphalangeal thumb to phocomelia) and congenital heart defects
  (predominantly atrial septal defects). Cardiac conduction abnormalities may occur
  independently of structural heart disease. The phenotype is highly variable even
  within families due to genetic background and stochastic modifiers.

      cases. TBX5 mutations can be identified in 70-74% of patients
      meeting strict clinical criteria.

pathophysiology:
  - name: TBX5 Haploinsufficiency in Limb and Heart Development
    description: >
      TBX5 is a T-box transcription factor essential for upper limb and cardiac
      morphogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations cause haploinsufficiency, disrupting
      dosage-sensitive transcriptional programs. In the heart, TBX5 cooperates
      with NKX2-5 to activate target genes including ANF and connexin 40, which
      are critical for cardiac septation and conduction system development.
      Missense mutations reduce TBX5 interaction with partner transcription
      factors and impair nuclear localization.
