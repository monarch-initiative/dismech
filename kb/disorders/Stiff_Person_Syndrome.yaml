description: >-
  A rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity
  and stiffness of axial muscles, particularly those of the trunk and legs,
  with superimposed painful muscle spasms triggered by unexpected stimuli,
  anxiety, or emotional upset. The condition is associated with high-titer
  anti-GAD65 antibodies that impair GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission.

pathophysiology:
- name: GABAergic Inhibition Impairment
  description: >-
    Anti-GAD65 antibodies target glutamic acid decarboxylase, the enzyme that
    synthesizes GABA from glutamate. This leads to reduced GABA production
    and impaired inhibitory neurotransmission, resulting in neuronal
    hyperexcitability. GAD65 is predominantly localized to synaptic vesicles
    and provides additional GABA synthesis when there is increased demand for
    rapid neurotransmitter release during high-frequency neural firing.
