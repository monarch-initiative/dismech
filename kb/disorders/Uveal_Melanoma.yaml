name: Uveal Melanoma
description: >-
  Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults,
  arising from melanocytes of the uveal tract (iris, ciliary body, and choroid).
  Unlike cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma is characterized by distinct driver
  mutations, with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations present in approximately 85% of cases,
  activating the Gq/11-PKC-MAPK signaling axis. BAP1 mutations are the most
  significant prognostic factor, associated with metastatic disease. Uveal
  melanoma has a propensity for hepatic metastasis, with approximately 50% of
  patients eventually developing liver metastases despite successful treatment
  of the primary tumor. Tebentafusp, a bispecific T-cell engager targeting
  gp100, represents the first systemic therapy to improve overall survival
  in metastatic uveal melanoma.

has_subtypes:
- name: Choroidal Melanoma
  description: >-
    Melanoma arising from the choroid, the vascular layer between the retina
    and sclera. Most common uveal melanoma subtype (85-90%). May cause retinal
    detachment, visual disturbance, or be discovered incidentally.
- name: Ciliary Body Melanoma
  description: >-
    Melanoma arising from the ciliary body, located behind the iris. Less common
    (5-10%) but associated with higher metastatic risk due to delayed detection
    and involvement of vascular structures.
- name: Iris Melanoma
  description: >-
    Melanoma arising from the iris, the colored portion of the eye. Least common
    uveal melanoma subtype (3-5%) but often detected earlier due to visible
    pigmented lesion. Generally better prognosis.
pathophysiology:
- name: GNAQ/GNA11 Oncogenic Mutations
  description: >-
    GNAQ and GNA11 encode alpha subunits of heterotrimeric Gq/11 G-proteins.
    Mutations at Q209 (most common) or R183 lock the protein in a constitutively
    active GTP-bound state, resulting in persistent downstream signaling
    through phospholipase C beta, protein kinase C, and ultimately the MAPK
    pathway. These mutations are mutually exclusive and early, initiating events.

    description: Active Gq/11 stimulates PLC-beta, generating DAG to activate PKC
- name: PKC-MAPK Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    Constitutively active GNAQ/GNA11 signaling activates phospholipase C-beta,
    generating diacylglycerol (DAG) that activates protein kinase C (PKC).
    PKC in turn activates the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade, driving melanocyte proliferation.
    This pathway represents a therapeutic target with MEK and PKC inhibitors.

    BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1) is a tumor suppressor encoding a deubiquitinase
    involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage response. BAP1 loss occurs in
    approximately 40% of uveal melanomas and is strongly associated with metastatic
    disease and poor prognosis. BAP1-deficient tumors exhibit altered gene expression
    patterns consistent with a more aggressive, less differentiated phenotype.

genetic:
- name: GNAQ Q209
  association: Somatic Oncogenic Mutation
  notes: >-
    Most common driver mutation in uveal melanoma, occurring in approximately
    45% of cases. Q209L and Q209P mutations lock the Gq alpha subunit in active
    GTP-bound state by disrupting GTPase activity.
- name: GNA11 Q209
  association: Somatic Oncogenic Mutation
  notes: >-
    Mutually exclusive with GNAQ mutations, present in approximately 40% of
    uveal melanomas. Functionally equivalent to GNAQ mutations, resulting in
    constitutive G11 alpha subunit activation.
- name: BAP1
  association: Somatic Tumor Suppressor Loss
  notes: >-
    BAP1 loss-of-function mutations occur in approximately 40% of uveal melanomas
    and are the strongest predictor of metastatic disease. Germline BAP1 mutations
    predispose to uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, and renal cell carcinoma.
- name: SF3B1
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    SF3B1 mutations occur in approximately 15-20% of uveal melanomas and are
    associated with intermediate prognosis. SF3B1 encodes a splicing factor,
    and mutations cause widespread splicing alterations.
- name: EIF1AX
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    EIF1AX mutations occur in approximately 15-20% of uveal melanomas and are
    associated with favorable prognosis and low metastatic risk. Mutually
    exclusive with BAP1 mutations.

    the tumor. First-line local therapy for many uveal melanomas, achieving
    excellent local control while preserving the eye in most cases.

  description: >-
    Anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies have limited efficacy in uveal melanoma
    compared to cutaneous melanoma, with response rates of approximately 5-10%.
    The immunologically cold tumor microenvironment may contribute to this
    resistance.

notes: >-
  Uveal melanoma is molecularly distinct from cutaneous melanoma, with GNAQ/GNA11
  mutations instead of BRAF/NRAS mutations. The propensity for hepatic metastasis
  is poorly understood but may relate to unique adhesion molecule expression or
  liver tropism factors. Despite excellent local control rates, approximately
  50% of patients develop metastatic disease, usually to the liver, with median
  survival of less than one year after metastasis. Clinical trials are evaluating
  hepatic-directed therapies and novel systemic approaches.
