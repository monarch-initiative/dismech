  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35422069
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "claudin-5 protein levels are significantly diminished in surgically resected brain tissue from patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Concomitantly, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in these patients showed widespread BBB disruption."
    explanation: Demonstrates that BBB dysfunction occurs in human epilepsy patients and is characterized by loss of tight junction proteins.
  - reference: PMID:35422069
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "inducible knockdown of claudin-5 in mice leads to spontaneous recurrent seizures, severe neuroinflammation, and mortality."
    explanation: Establishes causal role of BBB dysfunction in seizure generation, showing that disruption of endothelial tight junctions is sufficient to trigger spontaneous seizures.
  - reference: PMID:35422069
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "RepSox, a regulator of claudin-5 expression, can prevent seizure activity in experimental epilepsy."

    snippet: "Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin starting after 3 weeks of age significantly prolonged the survival of Depdc5cc+ mice and partially rescued the behavioral hyperactivity."
    explanation: Demonstrates that mTORC1 pathway hyperactivation caused by DEPDC5 loss drives epilepsy pathogenesis and that mTOR inhibition can rescue the phenotype.
  - reference: PMID:31174205
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Rapamycin decreased the enlarged brain size of Depdc5cc+ mice with corresponding decrease in neuronal soma size."
    explanation: Shows that mTOR hyperactivation causes abnormal neuronal growth contributing to epileptogenesis, which can be reversed by mTOR inhibition.
