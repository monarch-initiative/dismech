description: >-
  BRAF V600E-mutant colorectal cancer is a molecularly defined subtype representing approximately
  8-12% of all colorectal cancers. The V600E mutation causes constitutive activation of BRAF
  kinase, driving the MAPK signaling pathway independent of upstream RAS signaling. This subtype
  has historically been associated with poor prognosis, chemotherapy resistance, and limited
  treatment options. The combination of encorafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and cetuximab (anti-EGFR)
  has transformed outcomes for these patients by addressing the feedback reactivation that
  limits single-agent BRAF inhibitor efficacy seen in melanoma.

has_subtypes:
- name: MSI-H BRAF V600E CRC
  description: >-
    BRAF V600E mutation with concurrent microsatellite instability-high status, typically from
    MLH1 promoter hypermethylation. Better prognosis than MSS BRAF-mutant CRC, responds to
    immune checkpoint inhibitors.
- name: MSS BRAF V600E CRC
  description: >-
    BRAF V600E mutation with microsatellite stable (MSS) status. Represents the majority of
    BRAF-mutant CRC with aggressive behavior, poor response to chemotherapy, and need for
    targeted therapy approaches.
pathophysiology:
- name: BRAF V600E Constitutive Activation
  description: >-
    The V600E mutation substitutes glutamic acid for valine at position 600 in the activation
    segment of BRAF kinase. This mimics phosphorylation-induced activation, locking BRAF in
    an active conformation. The mutant kinase signals constitutively through MEK and ERK
    without upstream RAS activation.

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: BRAF mutations confers a poor prognosis in Western CRC patients, particularly in metastatic CRC (mCRC) and its mutations occur in approximately 4-20% CRC, with the vast majority being the V600E hotspot mutation.
    explanation: This abstract links BRAF mutations in CRC to the V600E hotspot and supports the relevance of V600E in colorectal cancer.

    description: Constitutive BRAF activation drives sustained MEK/ERK signaling
- name: Uncontrolled MAPK Pathway Signaling
  description: >-
    Constitutive BRAF V600E activation leads to continuous phosphorylation of MEK1/2, which
    phosphorylates ERK1/2. Activated ERK translocates to the nucleus and drives expression
    of genes promoting cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. This signaling is
    independent of growth factor receptor activation.

  - target: EGFR Feedback Reactivation
    description: ERK inhibition releases negative feedback on EGFR
- name: Enhanced Cell Proliferation
  description: >-
    Sustained ERK signaling promotes entry into the cell cycle by inducing cyclin D1 and
    other proliferative genes while suppressing cell cycle inhibitors. This drives continuous
    tumor cell division independent of external growth signals.

      label: colon
- name: EGFR Feedback Reactivation
  description: >-
    Unlike melanoma, colorectal cancer cells have high EGFR expression. When BRAF is inhibited,
    relief of ERK-mediated negative feedback leads to rapid EGFR reactivation, which signals
    through RAS and CRAF to restore MAPK pathway activity. This explains why BRAF inhibitor
    monotherapy fails in colorectal cancer but works in melanoma.

  notes: >-
    This feedback mechanism necessitates combination therapy with EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab)
    to block the reactivation pathway.

    BRAF V600E mutation is detected by PCR, immunohistochemistry (VE1 antibody), or
    next-generation sequencing. Testing should be performed on all metastatic CRC to guide
    treatment selection.

    All BRAF V600E tumors should be tested for MSI/MMR status as MSI-H BRAF-mutant tumors
    have better prognosis and respond to immunotherapy. MSS BRAF-mutant tumors require
    targeted therapy approaches.

  notes: >-
    The BRAF V600E mutation (c.1799T>A, p.V600E) accounts for more than 90% of BRAF mutations
    in colorectal cancer. It is mutually exclusive with RAS mutations. The mutation results
    in approximately 500-fold increased kinase activity compared to wild-type BRAF.
