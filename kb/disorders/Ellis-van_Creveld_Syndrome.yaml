  Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvC) is an autosomal recessive skeletal ciliopathy
  caused by mutations in EVC or EVC2 genes, which encode proteins essential for
  Hedgehog signaling at the primary cilium. It is characterized by disproportionate
  short-limb short stature, postaxial polydactyly, ectodermal dysplasia (including
  nail and dental anomalies), and congenital heart defects (most commonly a common
  atrium or single atrium). The syndrome has a notably high prevalence in the Old
  Order Amish population due to a founder effect.

pathophysiology:
- name: Hedgehog Signaling Disruption
  description: >
    EVC and EVC2 form a complex at the base of the primary cilium that is
    required for transduction of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. The complex interacts
    with Smoothened (Smo) and regulates Gli transcription factor processing.
    Loss of function of either protein impairs Hh-dependent processes including
    skeletal patterning, endochondral ossification, and cardiac septation.

    processing of GLI transcription factors, particularly GLI2 activation,
    which mediates Hedgehog pathway responses in growth plate chondrocytes
    and cardiac progenitors.
