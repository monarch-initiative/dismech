pathophysiology:
- name: Pathogen entry into the inner ear
  description: >
    Infectious agents reach the labyrinth through three main routes:
    (1) tympanogenic spread from the middle ear, where bacterial toxins
    or organisms cross the round or oval window membrane during otitis
    media; (2) meningitic spread via the cochlear aqueduct during
    bacterial meningitis; and (3) hematogenous or neurogenic spread,
    particularly for viral agents such as herpes simplex virus. In
    serous labyrinthitis, only toxins and inflammatory mediators cross
    the round window membrane without direct bacterial invasion,
    producing reversible dysfunction. In suppurative labyrinthitis,
    bacteria directly invade the perilymphatic space, causing severe
    purulent inflammation.

- name: Innate immune activation and cytokine release
  description: >
    Following pathogen entry, resident macrophages in the labyrinth
    transition to proinflammatory states and secrete tumor necrosis
    factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), and
    interleukin-6 (IL-6). These cytokines drive endothelial activation
    and initiate the inflammatory cascade. In viral labyrinthitis, the
    NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, promoting IL-1beta maturation
    through caspase-1 and triggering reactive oxygen species production,
    which contributes to oxidative stress in cochlear and vestibular
    structures.

    Cytokine and chemokine signaling drives sequential recruitment of
    leukocytes into the perilymphatic spaces. Neutrophils are the first
    to arrive, peaking at approximately day 1. CCR2-positive monocytes
    and macrophages follow, with CX3CR1-positive resident macrophages
    also expanding. Lymphocytes increase subacutely by days 4-7, and
    the myeloid infiltrate peaks around day 14 in experimental models.

    severity of cochlear inflammation and subsequent tissue remodeling.

  description: >
    The blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB), a specialized non-fenestrated
    microvascular barrier of the stria vascularis and cochlear
    capillaries, is disrupted by the inflammatory response. Pericyte
    and endothelial cell dysfunction under inflammatory and oxidative
    stress increases permeability, permitting serum proteins and
    leukocytes into cochlear fluids. In experimental meningitis,
    barrier disruption is detectable by 3 days post-infection and
    may restore by 7 days, but the transient breach amplifies
    inflammatory injury and impairs strial ion homeostasis.

- name: Vestibular neuroepithelial damage
  description: >
    Inflammatory mediators, leukocyte infiltration, and oxidative stress
    damage the vestibular sensory epithelium. Hair cells in the cristae
    ampullares and maculae undergo injury and apoptosis, producing acute
    unilateral vestibular loss. The resulting vestibular tone asymmetry
    generates the characteristic acute vestibular syndrome with severe
    vertigo, spontaneous nystagmus, and postural imbalance.

- name: Cochlear hair cell injury
  description: >
    Inflammatory mediators, leukocyte infiltration, and oxidative stress
    damage hair cells in the organ of Corti. Both inner and outer hair
    cells undergo apoptosis, and ribbon synapses between inner hair cells
    and spiral ganglion neuron dendrites are disrupted, producing
    sensorineural hearing loss. Damage to the stria vascularis disrupts
    the endocochlear potential required for hair cell mechanotransduction,
    further impairing auditory function. Cochlear involvement
    distinguishes labyrinthitis from vestibular neuritis, which spares
    hearing.

    Spiral ganglion neurons in Rosenthal's canal degenerate as a
    consequence of direct inflammatory damage, loss of neurotrophic
    support from damaged hair cells, and disruption of the cochlear
    microenvironment. Spiral ganglion neuron loss is a major determinant
    of permanent sensorineural hearing loss and limits the efficacy of
    cochlear implantation, as the implant relies on surviving neurons

- name: Endolymphatic hydrops
  description: >
    Post-inflammatory disruption of endolymph homeostasis can lead to
    endolymphatic hydrops. Damage to the stria vascularis impairs
    potassium recycling and the endocochlear potential, while injury
    to the endolymphatic sac or duct reduces endolymph reabsorption.
    The resulting fluid accumulation contributes to fluctuating hearing
    loss, tinnitus, and episodic vertigo in some patients during
    recovery or as a long-term sequela.

- name: Autoimmune-mediated inner ear damage
  description: >
    In some cases, the initial infectious trigger provokes an autoimmune
    response against inner ear antigens, perpetuating inflammation beyond
    the acute infection. Cross-reactive antibodies against inner ear
    proteins (including cochlin and heat shock proteins) and T cell-
    mediated inflammation may drive ongoing damage. This mechanism
    may explain bilateral, relapsing, or progressively worsening
    presentations that continue after clearance of the initial pathogen.

- name: Fibroblast proliferation in the labyrinth
  description: >
    Following acute inflammation, fibroblasts proliferate within the
    perilymphatic spaces of the labyrinth. Inflammatory cytokines
    and growth factors released during the immune response stimulate
    fibroblast activation and expansion. The severity of fibroblast
    proliferation is modulated by chemokine-controlled myeloid cell
    trafficking, particularly through CCR2 and CX3CR1 pathways.

  description: >
    Activated fibroblasts deposit extracellular matrix proteins

    fibrotic tissue that replaces normal labyrinthine structures.
    Fibrosis is most prominent in the scala tympani basal turn and
    distorts inner ear architecture, contributing to permanent

  description: >
    In the most severe cases, labyrinthine fibrosis progresses to

    post-infection. Osteoblast-like cells deposit mineralized tissue
    within the perilymphatic spaces, progressively obliterating the
    cochlear lumen. This labyrinthitis ossificans is most prominent
    in the scala tympani basal turn and causes permanent profound
    sensorineural hearing loss. The obliteration of cochlear
    architecture can prevent or severely complicate cochlear
    implantation, making early diagnosis and intervention critical.

    identified by HINTS examination findings (normal head impulse test,
    direction-changing nystagmus, or skew deviation) and MRI.
