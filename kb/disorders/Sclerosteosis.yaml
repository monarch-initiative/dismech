name: Sclerosteosis
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Sclerosteosis is an autosomal recessive progressive sclerosing bone dysplasia
  caused by loss-of-function mutations in the SOST gene, which encodes sclerostin,
  a secreted Wnt signaling antagonist. Loss of sclerostin leads to unopposed
  Wnt-mediated osteoblast activation and massive progressive bone formation
  throughout life. The condition is characterized by generalized hyperostosis
  and sclerosis of the skull, mandible, ribs, clavicles, and long bones, leading
  to cranial nerve compression. Hand malformations (syndactyly) and tall stature
  distinguish sclerosteosis from the closely related Van Buchem disease. The
  majority of affected individuals have been reported in the South African
  Afrikaner population due to a founder effect. Discovery of SOST led to
  development of anti-sclerostin antibodies (romosozumab) for osteoporosis.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Loss of Sclerostin (SOST Loss-of-Function)
    description: >
      SOST encodes sclerostin, a secreted glycoprotein with a cysteine-knot
      motif that functions as an antagonist of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
      pathway by binding to LRP5/LRP6 coreceptors on osteoblasts. Loss-of-
      function mutations abolish sclerostin production, removing the
      physiological brake on bone formation.

        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: "the three disease-causing mutations lead to loss of function of the SOST protein resulting in the formation of massive amounts of normal bone throughout life, the physiological role of SOST is most likely the suppression of bone formation"
        explanation: "Establishes that SOST loss causes massive bone formation and that sclerostin normally suppresses bone formation."

  - name: Unopposed Wnt/Beta-Catenin Osteoblast Activation
    description: >
      Loss of sclerostin removes the physiological brake on Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling in osteoblasts, leading to continuous, unopposed osteoblast
      activity and massive accumulation of structurally normal bone throughout
      life. SOST is an important therapeutic target for osteoporosis
      (anti-sclerostin antibody romosozumab).
