description: >-
  FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by activating mutations
  in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor, occurring in approximately 30%
  of newly diagnosed AML cases. The two main mutation types are internal tandem
  duplications (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain (25%) and tyrosine kinase domain
  (TKD) point mutations (7-10%). FLT3-ITD mutations confer an adverse prognosis with
  high relapse rates, while FLT3-TKD mutations have intermediate prognostic impact.
  The development of FLT3 inhibitors (midostaurin, gilteritinib) has significantly
  improved outcomes for these patients, representing a key example of precision
  medicine in AML.

has_subtypes:
- name: FLT3-ITD Mutated AML
  description: >-
    AML with internal tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3.
    ITD mutations cause ligand-independent receptor dimerization and constitutive
    activation. Associated with leukocytosis, high blast percentage, and poor
    prognosis, particularly when the ITD allelic ratio is high. Represents the
    most clinically significant FLT3 mutation subtype.
- name: FLT3-TKD Mutated AML
  description: >-
    AML with point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3, most commonly
    at codon D835. TKD mutations cause constitutive kinase activation but have a
    less adverse prognostic impact than ITD mutations. May co-occur with other
    mutations including NPM1.
pathophysiology:
- name: FLT3 Receptor Constitutive Activation
  description: >-
    FLT3 is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase normally involved in hematopoietic
    progenitor cell survival and proliferation. FLT3-ITD mutations cause
    ligand-independent receptor dimerization and constitutive autophosphorylation.
    FLT3-TKD mutations stabilize the active kinase conformation. Both result in
    aberrant downstream signaling.

    snippet: "In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FLT3 mutations-most commonly internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) substitutions-are among the most frequent genetic alterations, driving constitutive activation of proliferative and antiapoptotic pathways and conferring adverse prognosis."
    explanation: This abstract describes FLT3-ITD/TKD mutations driving constitutive activation in AML, matching the mechanism described.

  description: >-
    FLT3-ITD mutations preferentially activate STAT5 signaling compared to wild-type
    FLT3 or TKD mutations. Phosphorylated STAT5 translocates to the nucleus and
    activates transcription of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL-XL, PIM1) and cell cycle
    regulators, promoting leukemic cell survival and proliferation.

biochemical:
- name: FLT3-ITD Detection
  notes: >-
    PCR-based assays detect internal tandem duplications in the FLT3
    juxtamembrane domain. Allelic ratio (mutant/wild-type) has prognostic
    significance, with high ratios indicating worse outcomes.
- name: FLT3-TKD Mutation Analysis
  notes: >-
    Sequencing or allele-specific PCR detects point mutations at D835 and
    other TKD residues. Important for FLT3 inhibitor selection and prognosis.
genetic:
- name: FLT3-ITD
  association: Somatic Oncogenic Mutation
  notes: >-
    Internal tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane domain (exons 14-15)
    cause constitutive receptor dimerization and activation. ITD length
    and allelic ratio impact prognosis. Co-occurrence with NPM1 mutations
    partially mitigates the adverse prognostic impact.
- name: FLT3-TKD
  association: Somatic Oncogenic Mutation
  notes: >-
    Point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain, most commonly D835Y,
    cause constitutive kinase activation. Less adverse prognostic impact
    than ITD mutations but still targetable with FLT3 inhibitors.
