name: Spondyloepimetaphyseal Dysplasia Strudwick Type
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Strudwick type (SEMD Strudwick) is a rare
  type 2 collagenopathy caused by heterozygous COL2A1 mutations, characterized by
  disproportionate short-trunk dwarfism, scoliosis, pectus carinatum, cleft palate,
  and distinctive "dappled" or "pebbled" metaphyseal changes on radiographs. The
  condition was named after the original family described by Murdoch and Walker in
  1969. SEMD Strudwick is distinguished from other type 2 collagenopathies by its
  characteristic metaphyseal irregularities.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Type II Collagen Dysfunction
    description: >
      COL2A1 mutations in SEMD Strudwick produce abnormal type II collagen that
      disrupts cartilage matrix integrity. The characteristic metaphyseal changes
      reflect abnormal endochondral ossification at the growth plate. The specific
      mutations may cause distinctive structural abnormalities in the collagen
      triple helix.
