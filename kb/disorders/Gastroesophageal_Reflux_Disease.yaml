pathophysiology:
- name: Lower Esophageal Sphincter Dysfunction
  description: >
    Transient relaxations or chronic hypotension of the LES allow
    retrograde flow of gastric contents into the esophagus. Hiatal
    hernia exacerbates sphincter incompetence.

    snippet: "GERD starts in the stomach, where the refluxate material is produced. Following the trajectory of reflux, the failure of the antireflux barrier, primarily the lower oesophageal sphincter and the crural diaphragm, enables the refluxate to reach the oesophageal lumen, triggering oesophageal or extra-oesophageal symptoms."
    explanation: This review describes the failure of the antireflux barrier, particularly the lower esophageal sphincter, as a core mechanism allowing refluxate to enter the esophagus and cause symptoms.
  - reference: PMID:38177402

    snippet: "Alterations of the oesophageal mucosal integrity, such as macroscopic oesophagitis or microscopic changes, determine the perception of symptoms."
    explanation: Supports symptom effects of mucosal injury in GERD, but only indirectly supports LES dysfunction specifically.

    Gastric acid and pepsin damage esophageal epithelium, causing
    inflammation and erosions. Bile reflux in some patients adds
    to mucosal damage.

    snippet: "Reflux clearance mechanisms such as primary and secondary peristalsis and the arrival of bicarbonate-rich saliva are critical to prevent mucosal damage."
    explanation: This highlights the importance of clearance mechanisms in preventing mucosal damage from refluxate exposure in GERD.
  - reference: PMID:38177402
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "It is now recognized that different GERD phenotypes have different degrees of reflux, severity of mucosal integrity damage and type, and severity of symptoms."
    explanation: This review recognizes that mucosal integrity damage varies across GERD phenotypes and contributes to symptom severity.
- name: Impaired Esophageal Clearance
  description: >
    Reduced salivary neutralization, impaired peristalsis, and
    delayed acid clearance prolong mucosal exposure to refluxate.

    snippet: "Reflux clearance mechanisms such as primary and secondary peristalsis and the arrival of bicarbonate-rich saliva are critical to prevent mucosal damage."
    explanation: This directly supports the role of impaired clearance mechanisms in prolonging refluxate exposure and increasing mucosal damage in GERD.
- name: Visceral Hypersensitivity
  description: >
    Some patients experience symptoms with minimal acid exposure due
    to heightened esophageal sensory perception.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38177402
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The intensity of the symptoms is affected by peripheral and central neural and psychological mechanisms."
    explanation: This describes how neural mechanisms, including visceral hypersensitivity, affect symptom intensity in GERD patients even with varying degrees of acid exposure.
- name: Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis
  description: >
    Altered gut microbiota composition contributes to GERD risk through
    bidirectional causal relationships. Protective taxa include Actinobacteria
    and Methanobrevibacter, while risk taxa include Mollicutes and Tenericutes.

  - preferred_term: Stomach

      id: UBERON:0000945
      label: stomach
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38449873
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The IVW method's findings suggested protective roles against GERD for the Family Clostridiales Vadin BB60 group (P = 0.027), Genus Lachnospiraceae UCG004 (P = 0.026), Genus Methanobrevibacter (P = 0.026), and Phylum Actinobacteria (P = 0.019). In contrast, Class Mollicutes (P = 0.037), Genus Anaerostipes (P = 0.049), and Phylum Tenericutes (P = 0.024) emerged as potential GERD risk factors."
    explanation: This Mendelian randomization study establishes causal relationships between specific gut microbiota taxa and GERD risk, identifying both protective and risk-associated bacterial groups.
  - reference: PMID:38449873
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "For the first time, the MR analysis indicates a genetic link between gut microbiota abundance changes and GERD risk. This not only substantiates the potential of intestinal microecological therapy for GERD, but also establishes a basis for advanced research into the role of intestinal microbiota in the etiology of GERD."
    explanation: This confirms a genetic basis for the gut microbiome's causal role in GERD development and supports microbiome-targeted therapeutic approaches.
- name: Barrett's Esophagus Metaplastic Adaptation
  description: >
    Chronic reflux-induced inflammation drives metaplastic transformation of
    esophageal squamous epithelium to specialized columnar epithelium with
    altered tight junction protein expression, particularly claudin-18, which
    contributes to acid resistance.
  locations:
  - preferred_term: Esophageal Epithelium
    term:
      id: UBERON:0001976
      label: epithelium of esophagus
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:17932229
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In SCE, Cldn-18 was the most highly expressed at the mRNA level and this finding is paralleled by marked elevation in protein expression on immunoblots. In contrast in SqE, Cldn-18 was minimally expressed at the mRNA level and undetectable at the protein level."
    explanation: This demonstrates that Barrett's esophagus exhibits a dramatic shift in tight junction protein composition, with claudin-18 becoming the dominant protein in metaplastic epithelium.
  - reference: PMID:17932229
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "We conclude that Cldn-18 is the dominant claudin in the TJ of SCE and propose that the change from a Cldn-18-deficient TJ in SqE to a Cldn-18-rich TJ in SCE contributes to the greater acid resistance of BE."
    explanation: This establishes that the claudin-18-rich tight junctions in Barrett's esophagus provide enhanced acid resistance compared to normal squamous epithelium.
  - reference: PMID:17932229
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) that develops as replacement for damaged squamous epithelium (SqE) in subjects with reflux disease, and as such it is apparently more acid resistant than SqE."
    explanation: This describes Barrett's esophagus as a metaplastic adaptation that develops in response to chronic reflux-induced damage and provides greater acid resistance.
