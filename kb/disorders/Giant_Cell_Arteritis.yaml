description: >-
  A systemic granulomatous vasculitis affecting large and medium-sized arteries,
  predominantly the extracranial branches of the carotid artery. Most common
  primary systemic vasculitis in adults over 50. Frequently associated with
  polymyalgia rheumatica.
pathophysiology:
- name: Dendritic Cell Activation in Vessel Wall
  description: >-
    Adventitial dendritic cells become activated and produce chemokines that
    recruit T cells and macrophages. Vascular dendritic cells may sense
    pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns.

    snippet: >-
      Once activated, dendritic cells recruit CD4 T cells and induce their activation,
      proliferation and polarization into Th1 and Th17, which produce interferon-gamma
      (IFN-γ) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), respectively.
    explanation: >-
      This evidence confirms that dendritic cells are key initiators of the immune
      response in GCA, recruiting and activating CD4 T cells in the vessel wall.
- name: Th1 and Th17 T Cell Infiltration
  description: >-
    CD4+ T cells infiltrate the arterial wall and produce IFN-gamma (Th1)
    and IL-17 (Th17). IFN-gamma activates macrophages and promotes giant
    cell formation, while IL-17 drives vascular inflammation.

    snippet: >-
      IFN-γ triggers the production of chemokines by vascular smooth muscle cells,
      which leads to the recruitment of additional CD4 and CD8 T cells and also
      monocytes that differentiate into macrophages.
    explanation: >-
      This demonstrates the role of IFN-gamma from Th1 cells in recruiting additional
      immune cells and promoting macrophage differentiation in the vessel wall.

    snippet: >-
      Loss of self-tolerance in the adaptive immune system is linked to aberrant
      signaling in the NOTCH pathway, leading to expansion of NOTCH1+CD4+ T cells
      and the functional decline of NOTCH4+ T regulatory cells (Checkpoint 1).
    explanation: >-
      This evidence describes the checkpoint mechanism by which CD4+ T cells become
      dysregulated through NOTCH signaling, enabling their pathogenic infiltration
      into the arterial wall.
- name: Giant Cell Formation and Intimal Hyperplasia
  description: >-
    Multinucleated giant cells form at the media-intima junction. Smooth muscle
    cells proliferate causing intimal hyperplasia, leading to vessel stenosis
    and ischemic complications.

    snippet: >-
      Due to the failure of the immuno-inhibitory PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1)/PD-L1
      (programmed cell death ligand 1) pathway, wall-infiltrating immune cells arrive
      in a permissive tissues microenvironment, where multiple T cell effector lineages
      thrive, shift toward high glycolytic activity, and support the development of
      tissue-damaging macrophages, including multinucleated giant cells (Checkpoint 3).
    explanation: >-
      This describes the immune checkpoint failure that allows multinucleated giant
      cells to form in the vessel wall through unchecked macrophage activation.
  - reference: PMID:35629030
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      Under the influence of different mediators, mainly endothelin-1 and PDGF,
      vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to the intima, proliferate and change
      their phenotype to become myofibroblasts that further proliferate and produce
      extracellular matrix proteins, increasing the vascular stenosis.
    explanation: >-
      This evidence explains the mechanism of intimal hyperplasia whereby smooth
      muscle cells proliferate and produce extracellular matrix, leading to stenosis.

      Relapse rate prior to TCZ start (0.84 relapses/person-year) was 3-fold reduced
      while on TCZ (0.28 relapses/person-year; P < 0.001) but increased to 0.64
      relapses/person-year after TCZ discontinuation.
    explanation: >-
      This demonstrates tocilizumab's effectiveness in reducing relapse rates while
      on treatment, though relapse risk increases after discontinuation.

    snippet: >-
      TCZ is well tolerated in GCA, with low rates of discontinuation for AESIs.
      However, relapse occurred in > 50% despite median treatment > 12 months.
    explanation: >-
      This provides evidence for tocilizumab's safety profile and highlights the
      challenge of relapses even with prolonged treatment.

- name: JAK Inhibitors
  description: >-
    JAK/STAT pathway inhibitors (baricitinib, tofacitinib, upadacitinib) are
    emerging therapies for relapsing disease, particularly in patients failing
    tocilizumab.

    snippet: >-
      The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT)
      signalling pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of GCA and JAK inhibitors
      (JAKi) could be a therapeutic alternative.
    explanation: >-
      This provides the mechanistic rationale for using JAK inhibitors in GCA,
      linking the treatment to the underlying pathophysiology.
  - reference: PMID:38840219
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: >-
      This real-world analysis and literature review suggest that JAKi could be
      effective in GCA, including in patients failing established glucocorticoid-sparing
      therapies such as tocilizumab and methotrexate.
    explanation: >-
      This evidence demonstrates that JAK inhibitors can be effective even in
      patients who have failed other steroid-sparing therapies.
