    snippet: Classical EDS is a heritable disorder of connective tissue. Patients
      are affected with joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibilty, and skin fragility
      leading to atrophic scarring and significant bruising.
    explanation: This reference directly supports the claim that Classical EDS (cEDS)
      is characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and atrophic
      scarring.

    explanation: While hEDS is characterized by generalized joint hypermobility and
      chronic pain, the provided literature does not emphasize recurrent joint dislocations
      as a defining characteristic.
