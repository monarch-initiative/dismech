name: Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
description: >-
  Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer
  syndrome caused by germline pathogenic variants in the APC tumor suppressor gene.
  It is characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous
  polyps in the colon and rectum, with virtually 100% lifetime risk of colorectal
  cancer if untreated. FAP exemplifies the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and the role
  of Wnt/β-catenin pathway dysregulation in colorectal tumorigenesis. Extracolonic
  manifestations include desmoid tumors, duodenal adenomas, osteomas (Gardner syndrome),
  and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE).

has_subtypes:
- name: Classic FAP
  description: >-
    Characterized by >100 colorectal adenomatous polyps, typically appearing in
    adolescence with polyposis by age 20-30. Without prophylactic colectomy,
    colorectal cancer develops by age 40 on average. Caused by mutations in the
    mutation cluster region (MCR) of APC.
- name: Attenuated FAP (AFAP)
  description: >-
    Milder phenotype with fewer polyps (10-100), later onset of polyposis,
    right-sided colon predominance, and delayed colorectal cancer risk (average
    age 50-55). Associated with mutations at the 5' or 3' ends of APC or in
    the alternatively spliced region of exon 9.
- name: Gardner Syndrome
  description: >-
    FAP variant with prominent extracolonic manifestations including osteomas
    (especially mandible and skull), epidermoid cysts, desmoid tumors, and
    dental abnormalities. Historically considered separate but now recognized
    as FAP with variable expressivity.
pathophysiology:
- name: APC Tumor Suppressor Loss
  description: >-
    Germline heterozygous APC mutations result in one functional allele. Somatic
    loss or mutation of the remaining wild-type allele (second hit) eliminates
    APC function, initiating adenoma formation. This follows Knudson's two-hit
    hypothesis for tumor suppressor gene inactivation.

    snippet: >-
      In agreement with Knudson's 'two-hit' theory, the inactivation of the residual
      APC gene in FAP is a critical step in the development of both colorectal
      cancer and desmoids.
    explanation: >-
      Confirms that FAP follows the two-hit mechanism for both colorectal cancer
      and desmoid tumor development.
- name: Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    APC normally functions in the destruction complex (with Axin, GSK3β, CK1)
    to phosphorylate β-catenin, targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal
    degradation. Loss of APC allows β-catenin to accumulate, translocate to the
    nucleus, and activate Wnt target genes driving proliferation.

    Nuclear β-catenin activates TCF/LEF transcription factors, driving expression
    of Wnt target genes including MYC, CCND1 (cyclin D1), and others that promote
    cell cycle progression. This results in uncontrolled proliferation of
    intestinal crypt cells, forming adenomatous polyps.

    sequence. In FAP, hundreds to thousands of adenomas develop, dramatically
    increasing the probability that one will progress to carcinoma.

- name: APC Genetic Testing
  notes: >-
    Molecular testing identifies germline APC mutations in 70-90% of classic FAP
    families. Mutations include truncating variants, large deletions, and deep
    intronic variants. Genotype-phenotype correlations exist: mutations in the
    MCR (codons 1250-1464) cause severe polyposis; 5'/3' mutations cause AFAP.
genetic:
- name: APC
  association: Germline Loss-of-Function Mutations
  inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
  notes: >-
    APC (5q22.2) encodes adenomatous polyposis coli, a key component of the
    β-catenin destruction complex. Most germline mutations are truncating
    (nonsense, frameshift) resulting in loss of function. De novo mutations
    account for 20-30% of cases. Mutation location correlates with phenotype:
    MCR mutations (codons 1250-1464) cause classic severe FAP; 5' mutations
    (before codon 157) and 3' mutations (after codon 1595) cause attenuated FAP.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28668823
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      Several lines of evidence show that germline mutations affect the functional
      domains of the APC gene that are responsible for interactions of the transcript
      with β-catenin, whereas somatic second mutations involve the downstream region
      of the gene.
    explanation: >-
      Review confirms germline APC mutations affect β-catenin binding domains
      and somatic second hits occur in downstream regions.
treatments:

    Surgical removal of the colon is the primary management to prevent colorectal
    cancer. Options include total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
    (IPAA) or subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). Timing is
    typically in late teens/early twenties or when polyp burden becomes
    unmanageable endoscopically.
