name: Burkitt Lymphoma
description: >-
  Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized
  by MYC oncogene translocation, typically t(8;14)(q24;q32) involving the immunoglobulin
  heavy chain locus. Three clinical variants exist: endemic (African), sporadic, and
  immunodeficiency-associated. Endemic Burkitt lymphoma is strongly associated with
  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and commonly presents as jaw tumors in children
  in malaria-endemic regions. The disease exemplifies the role of MYC dysregulation
  in driving uncontrolled cell proliferation, with one of the fastest doubling times
  of any human cancer.

has_subtypes:
- name: Endemic Burkitt Lymphoma
  description: >-
    African variant strongly associated with EBV infection (>95% EBV-positive),
    occurring predominantly in children in equatorial Africa. Classically presents
    as jaw or facial tumors. Geographic distribution correlates with malaria
    endemicity, suggesting chronic immune activation as a cofactor.
- name: Sporadic Burkitt Lymphoma
  description: >-
    Occurs worldwide without geographic restriction. Less commonly EBV-associated
    (15-30% in developed countries). Typically presents with abdominal masses,
    often involving the ileocecal region. More common in children and young adults.
- name: Immunodeficiency-Associated Burkitt Lymphoma
  description: >-
    Occurs in patients with HIV/AIDS or other immunodeficiency states. EBV
    association is intermediate (25-40%). May present as the initial AIDS-defining
    illness. Requires concurrent management of underlying immunodeficiency.

  description: >-
    EBV infection is nearly universal in endemic Burkitt lymphoma (>95%) but
    variable in sporadic (15-30%) and immunodeficiency-associated (25-40%) forms.
    EBV provides survival signals through EBNA1 and contributes to genomic instability,
    but MYC translocation is the essential oncogenic driver. EBV latency type I is
    typically observed with expression of EBNA1 and EBERs only.
pathophysiology:
- name: MYC Translocation and Oncogene Activation
  description: >-
    The hallmark of Burkitt lymphoma is translocation of the MYC oncogene on
    chromosome 8 to an immunoglobulin locus, most commonly t(8;14)(q24;q32)
    involving the IGH locus, or less commonly t(2;8) or t(8;22) involving
    light chain loci. This places MYC under control of immunoglobulin enhancers,
    resulting in constitutive MYC overexpression.

  description: >-
    MYC is a master transcriptional regulator of cell growth and proliferation.
    Constitutive MYC expression drives continuous cell cycle progression, resulting
    in one of the fastest doubling times of any human tumor (approximately 24 hours).
    The proliferation fraction approaches 100% (Ki-67 staining).

  description: >-
    While MYC normally sensitizes cells to apoptosis, Burkitt lymphoma cells
    acquire mutations or alterations that counteract MYC-induced apoptosis.
    TP53 mutations occur in approximately 30% of cases. EBV-encoded EBNA1 and
    EBERs provide additional survival signals in EBV-positive cases.

    The combination of constitutive MYC-driven proliferation and apoptosis
    resistance results in rapidly growing tumors. The high proliferation rate
    paradoxically makes the tumor highly sensitive to chemotherapy, contributing
