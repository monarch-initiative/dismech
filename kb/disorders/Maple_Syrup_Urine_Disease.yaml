pathophysiology:
- name: Branched-Chain Alpha-Ketoacid Dehydrogenase Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in genes encoding subunits of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid
    dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH) cause deficient catabolism of branched-chain
    amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine). This leads to accumulation of
    these amino acids and their toxic ketoacid derivatives in blood and tissues.
    The BCKDH complex catalyzes the first irreversible step in BCAA catabolism.

- name: Leucine and Ketoacid Neurotoxicity
  description: >
    Elevated leucine and its metabolite alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) are particularly
    neurotoxic. KIC inhibits key mitochondrial enzymes including alpha-ketoglutarate
    dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, disrupting brain energy metabolism.
    Leucine also competes for transport across the blood-brain barrier via LAT1,
    depleting other essential amino acids in the brain.

      (by 69%) and serum (by 56%) isolated from iMSUD mice, and restored levels of
      mitochondrial metabolites"
    explanation: Preclinical evidence supports metformin as potential
      therapeutic strategy for MSUD.
