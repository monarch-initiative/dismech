description: 'Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of mitochondrial
  long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in HADHA (encoding the alpha subunit) or HADHB
  (encoding the beta subunit) of the heterooctameric mitochondrial trifunctional protein complex. MTP harbors three enzymatic
  activities: long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD), and long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA
  thiolase (LCKAT). Complete deficiency of all three activities results in MTP deficiency, which is clinically heterogeneous,
  ranging from severe neonatal presentations with cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia, and early death, to milder later-onset forms
  with peripheral neuropathy and episodic rhabdomyolysis. The mortality is high, reported as 57.9% in a large retrospective
  analysis. HADHB mutations are more frequent in Asian populations and are associated with atypical presentations. Maternal
  HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy may be associated with pregnancies carrying affected fetuses.

    MTP impairs the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids, leading to energy failure particularly during fasting or metabolic

notes: 'MTP deficiency should be distinguished from isolated LCHAD deficiency (caused specifically by the HADHA c.1528G>C
  mutation affecting only LCHAD activity), which is more common. Complete TFP deficiency involves loss of all three enzymatic
  activities and tends to have a more severe prognosis. HADHB mutations can present as isolated axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease, and MTP deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hereditary sensorimotor neuropathies.
  The genotype-phenotype correlation shows that HADHA mutations tend to produce a phenotype more similar to LCHAD deficiency,
  while HADHB mutations produce a neuromusculoskeletal phenotype.
