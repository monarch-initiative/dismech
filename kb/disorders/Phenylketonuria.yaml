has_subtypes:
- name: Classic PKU
  description: Severe PAH deficiency with blood Phe greater than 1200 micromol/L untreated.
- name: Mild PKU
  description: Moderate PAH deficiency with blood Phe 600-1200 micromol/L untreated.
- name: BH4-Responsive PKU
  description: Responds to tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation.
pathophysiology:
- name: Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in PAH gene cause deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity.
    Phenylalanine cannot be converted to tyrosine, leading to phenylalanine
    accumulation in blood and tissues.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:29025426
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism caused by deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine."
    explanation: European guidelines confirm PAH deficiency as the core enzymatic defect in PKU.
- name: Neurotoxicity
  description: >
    Elevated phenylalanine in the brain interferes with neurotransmitter synthesis,
    myelin formation, and protein synthesis. Phenylalanine competes with other
    large neutral amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Phenylketonuria (PKU; also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine metabolism, in which especially high phenylalanine concentrations cause brain dysfunction."
    explanation: The Nature Reviews Primer identifies high phenylalanine as the direct cause of brain dysfunction.
  - reference: PMID:37265600
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that white matter alterations in early-treated phenylketonuria persist into adulthood, are most prominent in the posterior white matter and are likely to be driven by axonal damage."
    explanation: DTI study demonstrates white matter damage persists even in early-treated adults.
