    id: MONDO:0009861
    label: phenylketonuria
has_subtypes:
- name: Classic PKU
  description: Severe PAH deficiency with blood Phe greater than 1200 micromol/L untreated.
- name: Mild PKU
  description: Moderate PAH deficiency with blood Phe 600-1200 micromol/L untreated.
- name: BH4-Responsive PKU
  description: Responds to tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation.
pathophysiology:
- name: Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in PAH gene cause deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity.
    Phenylalanine cannot be converted to tyrosine, leading to phenylalanine
    accumulation in blood and tissues.

  - preferred_term: Phenylalanine Metabolism
    term:
      id: GO:0006558
      label: L-phenylalanine metabolic process
- name: Neurotoxicity
  description: >
    Elevated phenylalanine in the brain interferes with neurotransmitter synthesis,
    myelin formation, and protein synthesis. Phenylalanine competes with other
    large neutral amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier.

  - preferred_term: Neurodevelopment
    term:
      id: GO:0007399
      label: nervous system development
- name: Melanin Deficiency
  description: >
    Reduced tyrosine availability impairs melanin synthesis, causing fair skin,
    light hair, and blue eyes characteristic of untreated PKU.
