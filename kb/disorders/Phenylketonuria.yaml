    label: phenylketonuria
has_subtypes:
- name: Classic PKU
  description: Severe PAH deficiency with blood Phe greater than 1200 micromol/L untreated.
- name: Mild PKU
  description: Moderate PAH deficiency with blood Phe 600-1200 micromol/L untreated.
- name: BH4-Responsive PKU

pathophysiology:
- name: Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in PAH gene cause deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity.
    Phenylalanine cannot be converted to tyrosine, leading to phenylalanine
    accumulation in blood and tissues.

  - reference: PMID:26425393
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism caused by the deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of Phe and its metabolites in tissues and body fluids of PKU patients."
    explanation: Review confirms PAH deficiency leads to phenylalanine accumulation in tissues and body fluids.
- name: Neurotoxicity
  description: >
    Elevated phenylalanine in the brain interferes with neurotransmitter synthesis,
    myelin formation, and protein synthesis. Phenylalanine competes with other
    large neutral amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier.
