description: >-
  RET-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a molecularly-defined lung
  cancer subtype driven by chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET proto-oncogene.
  RET fusions occur in approximately 1-2% of NSCLC and result in constitutive activation
  of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. Like ALK and ROS1 fusions, RET-positive NSCLC
  occurs predominantly in younger patients with minimal smoking history. Selpercatinib
  and pralsetinib are highly selective RET inhibitors that have transformed outcomes
  for patients with RET-driven cancers.

has_subtypes:
- name: KIF5B-RET NSCLC
  description: >-
    KIF5B-RET is the most common RET fusion in NSCLC (~70-90%), resulting from a
    pericentric inversion on chromosome 10. The kinesin family member provides a
    coiled-coil dimerization domain.
- name: CCDC6-RET NSCLC
  description: >-
    CCDC6-RET accounts for approximately 15-20% of RET fusions in NSCLC. Also
    common in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC1).
- name: NCOA4-RET NSCLC
  description: >-
    NCOA4-RET is a less common fusion variant, also found in thyroid cancer
    (PTC3).
pathophysiology:
- name: RET Gene Rearrangement
  description: >-
    RET rearrangements result from chromosomal inversions or translocations that
    fuse the RET kinase domain (10q11.21) to an N-terminal partner gene. The partner
    gene provides a dimerization domain, causing constitutive RET kinase activation
    independent of ligand. RET normally signals through GDNF family ligands and
    GFR-alpha co-receptors.

  description: >-
    RET fusion proteins are constitutively dimerized and auto-phosphorylated,
    activating downstream signaling including RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and PLCgamma
    pathways. RET also activates SRC family kinases and JAK-STAT signaling.

    RET-rearranged tumors exhibit oncogene addiction, becoming dependent on
    continued RET signaling for survival. Selective RET inhibition leads to
    rapid and durable tumor responses.

- name: RET Inhibitor Resistance
  description: >-
    Resistance to selective RET inhibitors can develop through secondary RET
    kinase mutations (G810R/S/C solvent front mutations, V804L/M gatekeeper),
    RET amplification, or bypass pathway activation (MET, KRAS, BRAF). Solvent
    front mutations are the most common resistance mechanism.

biochemical:
- name: RET Testing
  notes: >-
    RET testing is recommended for all advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Methods include
    FISH, immunohistochemistry (screening), and next-generation sequencing (identifies
    fusion partner). RNA-based NGS is preferred as it detects expressed fusions.
    RET fusions are mutually exclusive with EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and KRAS alterations.
genetic:
- name: RET
  association: Somatic Rearrangement
  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    RET (10q11.21) encodes the rearranged during transfection receptor tyrosine
    kinase. Gene rearrangements occur somatically. Common fusion partners in NSCLC
    include KIF5B (~70-90%), CCDC6 (~15-20%), and NCOA4. Germline RET mutations
    cause MEN2 syndrome; somatic RET fusions drive lung and thyroid cancers.
    Resistance mutations include G810R/S/C (solvent front) and V804L/M (gatekeeper).

    domain to RET kinase domain.
