    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: 'Criteria for Jeavons syndrome included all of the following: (1) eyelid
      myoclonia with or without absences...'
    explanation: The criteria for diagnosing Jeavons syndrome include eyelid myoclonia
      with or without absences, supporting the statement's description.
  - reference: PMID:37329145
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: There was consensus that generalized tonic-clonic and absence seizures
      are typically or occasionally seen in patients.
    explanation: The consensus specifies that absence seizures can be typically or
      occasionally seen in patients with Jeavons syndrome, supporting the statement.

  description: Eyelid myoclonia with absences that are consistently provoked by photic
    stimulation.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35394968
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia (EMA) is characterized by eyelid myoclonia,
      eyelid closure sensitivity, and photosensitivity.
    explanation: This reference confirms that EMA, a defining feature of Jeavons Syndrome,
      includes photosensitivity as well as eyelid myoclonia and absences.
  - reference: PMID:29722743
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Eyelid myoclonia with absences, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and
      severe photosensitivity accompanied by eyelid myoclonia.
    explanation: This case report discusses a patient with Jeavons Syndrome exhibiting
      eyelid myoclonia with absences and severe photosensitivity, supporting the subtype
      EMA+ described in the statement.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:32554361
    supports: REFUTE
    snippet: It is thought to be underdiagnosed rather than have a rare prevalence.
    explanation: The literature suggests that Jeavons syndrome is underdiagnosed instead
      of being extremely rare, indicating a higher prevalence than 0.0001%.

    snippet: The mean age at seizure onset was 8.7+/-5.3 years and the mean age at
      admission to hospital was 17.8+/-10.7 years.
    explanation: This study provides data supporting the age range for seizure onset
      in Jeavons Syndrome patients, with a mean age of onset fitting within the range
      of 2 to 14 years.
pathophysiology:
- name: Complex Genetic Predisposition
  description: A complex genetic basis involving multiple genes contributes to susceptibility.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:30082241
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Jeavons syndrome is an underreported epileptic syndrome characterized
      by eyelid myoclonia, eyelid closure-induced seizures or electroencephalography
      paroxysms, and photosensitivity. Drug-resistant epilepsy is common, but the
      prognostic factors and clinical course leading to drug resistance have not been
      well characterized.
    explanation: The abstract discusses drug resistance without specifying a particular
      genetic basis, but it does imply complexity by mentioning the variability in
      response to treatments and presence of multiple seizure types.
- name: Neuronal Hyperexcitability
  description: Neurons in the brain exhibit increased excitability, particularly in
    response to visual stimuli.

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: 'We observed two neurophysiologic findings in JS: (1) focal interictal
      EDs from posterior head region; and (2) predominant focal posterior ictal EDs
      preceding generalized EDs.'
    explanation: While the study supports an increased excitability of neurons in
      response to visual stimuli (such as photic stimulation), it does not specifically
      identify excitatory glutamatergic neurons as the key cell type involved.
  - reference: PMID:31444362
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: The transition from a preictal state to a generalized seizure leads to
      an abrupt increase in neural activity and connectivity, which is accompanied
      by a strong alteration in glia-neuron interactions and a massive increase in
      extracellular glutamate.
    explanation: This study discusses neural activity and connectivity alterations
      and increased extracellular glutamate during seizures but does not specifically
      associate these findings with Jeavons Syndrome.
- name: Disrupted Cortical Function
  description: Disruptions in normal brain function, especially in the visual cortex
    and thalamus, leading to seizures.

      label: dorsal plus ventral thalamus
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:21729035
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: JS has been proposed as idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) because
      of normal posterior dominant background activity and paroxysmal generalized
      ictal epileptiform discharges (EDs). However, we noticed subtle occipital EDs
      preceding EM and interictal posterior EDs using digital video-EEG... Further
      clinical observations of seizures induced by eye closure, photic stimulation,
      and hyperventilation along with EEG paroxysms would raise the possibility of
      the occipital cortex initiating generalized epilepsy network involving the brainstem,
      and thalamocortical and transcortical pathways in JS.
    explanation: The literature indicates involvement of the occipital cortex and
      mentions generalized epilepsy networks, which may include the thalamus. However,
      it does not explicitly support the claim that disruptions in the visual cortex
      and thalamus are the predominant mechanisms in Jeavons Syndrome.
  - reference: PMID:29880477
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: Largely accepted in the literature is the role the interconnections between
      the thalamus and cortex play in generalized epilepsy. However, thalamocortical
      involvement is less understood in focal epilepsy in terms of the effect of seizures
      on thalamocortical circuitry in the developing brain and subsequent cognitive
      outcome.
    explanation: This study discusses the role of thalamocortical connections in generalized
      and focal epilepsy but does not provide specific information on Jeavons Syndrome
      or its mechanisms.

    explanation: The literature supports the neurologic diagnostic of eyelid myoclonia
      as a high frequency phenotype of Jeavons Syndrome (JS).
  - reference: PMID:30685520
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Eyelid myoclonia, the most common seizure type in all 8 patients, were
      typically initiated by eating or other simple orofacial stimuli.
    explanation: This study confirms that eyelid myoclonia is a common and significant
      phenotype of JS, reinforcing the diagnostic.

    snippet: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of STAG2 encephalopathy
      fulfilling all electroclinical criteria for epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia and
      absences (EMA), formally named Jeavons syndrome (JS).
    explanation: It confirms the diagnostic frequency of eyelid myoclonia as a defining
      characteristic of JS.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:15508923
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Eyelid myoclonia and absence.
    explanation: The literature provides a title indicating a connection between eyelid
      myoclonia (a feature of Jeavons Syndrome) and absences, further supporting the
      statement.
- category: Neurologic
  name: Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures
  frequency: OCCASIONAL
  evidence:

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: After a median follow-up of two years, 80% of patients had drug-resistant
      epilepsy and 70% experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
    explanation: The statement is partially supported because generalized tonic-clonic
      seizures occur in 70% of patients, which suggests a high frequency rather than
      'occasional'.
- category: Cognitive
  name: Mild Cognitive Impairment
  frequency: OCCASIONAL
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26492104
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: All participants completed neuropsychological evaluations. Statistical
      analyses revealed performance that was below average on measures of global IQ,
      processing speed and rote, verbal learning coupled with average nonverbal reasoning,
      and sustained attention. There was also evidence of impaired higher-level verbal
      reasoning. While global IQ ranged from low average to borderline impaired, no
      participant could be accurately described as impaired or having intellectual
      disability (ID) given the consistently average performance noted on some higher-order
      tasks including nonverbal reasoning.
    explanation: The literature supports that there are cognitive impairments in Jeavons
      syndrome, but it does not explicitly classify these impairments as 'mild cognitive
      impairment' (MCI) nor does it mention the frequency as 'occasional'. The impairments
      are more specific and varied, making the statement partially correct but not
      completely accurate.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Ictal EEG showed 3 - 6 Hz generalized spike and waves and polyspikes
      burst.
    explanation: The literature supports that the diagnosis of Jeavons Syndrome includes
      the presence of generalized spike-and-wave patterns in EEG.
genetic:
- name: CHD2
  association: Associated
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26262932
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Conversely, CHD2 could be responsible for a proper phenotype characterized
      by infantile-onset generalized epilepsy, intellectual disability, and photosensitivity,
      which might overlap with MAE, Lennox-Gastaut, Dravet, and Jeavons syndromes.
    explanation: The literature indicates that CHD2 mutations may overlap with phenotypes
      seen in Jeavons Syndrome, but it does not specifically state a direct genetic
      association exclusive to Jeavons Syndrome.
- name: GABRA1

    supports: REFUTE
    snippet: An Ala322Asp mutation in the GABRA1 gene was recently reported to be
      responsible for causing the autosomal dominant (AD) form of juvenile myoclonic
      epilepsy (JME) in a French-Canadian family.
    explanation: The abstract does not mention Jeavons syndrome and focuses on juvenile
      myoclonic epilepsy related to GABRA1 mutations in a different population.
  - reference: PMID:30082241
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: We identified 30 patients who met the diagnostic criteria of Jeavons
      syndrome at a single institution...
    explanation: The study focuses on clinical features and treatment response in
      Jeavons syndrome without mentioning GABRA1 or a genetic association.
  - reference: PMID:20074235

    supports: REFUTE
    snippet: We did not detect any pathogenic mutations in SLC2A1 in this cohort.
      Our data suggests that the frequency of GLUT1 mutations in NAFE is low.
    explanation: The study indicates that no pathogenic mutations in SLC2A1 were found
      in the cohort, suggesting a low frequency of association with certain types
      of epilepsy, including Jeavons syndrome.

    snippet: Spikes/spike-waves time-locked to the flash frequency during intermittent
      light stimulation in Jeavons syndrome.
    explanation: This study indicates that flashing lights (photic stimulation) are
      associated with spikes and spike-waves in individuals with Jeavons syndrome,
      supporting the statement.
  - reference: PMID:14706039
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: In addition to this 'transversal' presence of the photosensitive trait
      across various epilepsy types and diseases, some syndromes in which all, or
      almost all, seizures are induced by photic stimuli seem to have sufficient specificity
      and may be considered as syndromes of pure reflex photosensitive epilepsy.
    explanation: The study broadly discusses photosensitive epilepsy and its triggers
      but does not focus solely on Jeavons Syndrome. It implies a possible link but
      does not confirm the statement definitively.
  - reference: PMID:28508035
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: '''We propose that flashing light stimuli can be used as an experimental
      tool to investigate the visual function and plasticity of neuronal representations

      and plasticity but does not directly relate to Jeavons Syndrome or its triggering
      factors.

    snippet: This study demonstrates that photosensitivity is enhanced after awakening
      from a short sleep following sleep deprivation. Thus, we recommend performing
      IPS after awakening to increase sensitivity to detect photoparoxysmal epileptiform
      discharges.
    explanation: This reference indicates that sleep deprivation can enhance photosensitivity
      in patients, which can be a symptom exacerbation in conditions like Jeavons
      Syndrome, where photosensitivity is a significant factor.

    snippet: Valproic acid, used alone or in combination with other anticonvulsants
      in 100 children with epilepsy, improved seizure control in all age groups.
    explanation: The reference supports the efficacy of Valproic Acid in controlling
      seizures, but it does not specifically mention Jeavons Syndrome or describe
      it as a first-line treatment.

    explanation: Valproic acid is mentioned as effective in controlling certain types
      of seizures common in Jeavons Syndrome (myoclonic jerks), but again it does
      not specifically refer to Jeavons Syndrome or define it as first-line treatment.

      (petit mal) epilepsy.
    explanation: The reference supports the use of ethosuximide as a treatment for
      generalized absence epilepsy, which is related to Jeavons syndrome. However,
      it does not provide specific evidence for its use as an alternative or adjunctive

      for generalized and partial childhood epilepsies and for some types of specific
      epileptic syndromes of infancy and childhood (such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy,
      benign rolandic epilepsy, and Jeavon syndrome) has been demonstrated.
