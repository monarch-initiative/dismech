description: >
  Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder
  caused by heterozygous mutations in genes encoding components of the TGF-beta
  signaling pathway, most commonly TGFBR1 and TGFBR2. It is characterized by the
  triad of arterial tortuosity and aneurysms, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or
  cleft palate. Additional features include craniosynostosis, skeletal abnormalities
  (scoliosis, pectus deformity, joint laxity or contractures), thin translucent skin,
  and immunologic features (food allergy, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease).
  LDS carries a high risk of aortic dissection at smaller aortic diameters than
  Marfan syndrome, with a mean age at death of 26.0 years in initial cohorts.
  Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical management are critical.

pathophysiology:
- name: Paradoxical TGF-beta Signaling
  description: >
    Loss-of-function mutations in TGF-beta receptors paradoxically lead to
    increased TGF-beta signaling in the aortic wall, mediated through
    non-canonical pathways and compensatory upregulation. This results in
    excessive SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and activation of ERK and p38 MAPK
    downstream targets that promote extracellular matrix degradation.

      aortic aneurysm in a mouse model of MFS is associated with increased
      TGF-beta signaling and can be prevented by TGF-beta antagonists such
      as TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody or the angiotensin II type 1
      receptor (AT1) blocker, losartan
    explanation: >-
      Habashi et al. provide the mechanistic rationale for losartan therapy
      in TGF-beta pathway disorders.

    snippet: >-
      Angiotensin receptor blockers may be particularly beneficial due to
      their effects on the TGF-beta signaling cascade
    explanation: >-
      Clinical guidelines support ARB use for their pathway-specific effects
      beyond blood pressure reduction.

  description: >
    Beta-blockers to reduce hemodynamic stress on the aorta. Standard-of-care
    for syndromic aneurysm conditions, often used in combination with ARBs.

      Beta-Blockade to reduce hemodynamic stress on the vasculature has been
      the standard-of-care treatment for individuals with syndromic aneurysm
      conditions
    explanation: >-
      Beta-blockers are established standard of care for LDS vascular management.
- name: Comprehensive Vascular Surveillance
  description: >
    Regular MRA or CTA imaging of the entire arterial tree from head to pelvis,
    as aneurysms can occur throughout the vascular system. Full vascular imaging
    at initial evaluation and at 2-year intervals if no aneurysms identified.

      Diagnostic or baseline vascular imaging through magnetic resonance
      angiography or computerized tomography angiography with
      three-dimensional reconstruction of the head, neck, chest, abdomen,
      and pelvis should be performed
    explanation: >-
      MacCarrick et al. recommend comprehensive head-to-pelvis imaging
      for all LDS patients.
