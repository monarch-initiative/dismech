description: >-
  Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized
  by bone marrow fibrosis, abnormal megakaryocyte proliferation, extramedullary
  hematopoiesis, and progressive cytopenias. Driver mutations include JAK2 V617F
  (approximately 60%), CALR (25%), and MPL (5%), with 10% being triple-negative.
  Additional mutations in epigenetic regulators (ASXL1, TET2, EZH2) and splicing
  factors contribute to disease heterogeneity and prognosis. PMF causes marked
  splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and carries risk of transformation to
  acute myeloid leukemia. JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib and fedratinib provide
  symptom control, while allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only
  curative option.

stages:
- name: Prefibrotic PMF
  description: >-
    Early stage characterized by hypercellular marrow with megakaryocyte
    proliferation and atypia, but minimal or absent reticulin fibrosis (grade 0-1).
    Often presents with thrombocytosis and may be mistaken for essential
    thrombocythemia.
- name: Overt PMF
  description: >-
    Advanced stage with significant reticulin or collagen fibrosis (grade 2-3),
    progressive cytopenias, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms.
    Leukoerythroblastic blood picture and tear-drop cells are characteristic.
pathophysiology:
- name: JAK-STAT Pathway Hyperactivation
  description: >-
    Driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL all converge on constitutive activation
    of JAK-STAT signaling. JAK2 V617F directly activates the kinase; CALR and MPL
    mutations lead to activation of MPL receptor signaling.

- name: Abnormal Megakaryopoiesis
  description: >-
    Driver mutations cause aberrant megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation.
    Megakaryocytes show characteristic atypia with clustering, abnormal lobation,
    and defective platelet production.

  description: >-
    Atypical megakaryocytes release profibrotic cytokines including TGF-beta,
    PDGF, and bFGF, stimulating marrow stromal cells to deposit reticulin and
    collagen fibers. Progressive fibrosis replaces normal hematopoietic tissue.
