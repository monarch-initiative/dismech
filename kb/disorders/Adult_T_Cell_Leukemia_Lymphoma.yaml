description: >-
  Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive peripheral T-cell neoplasm
  caused by Human T-lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. The disease develops
  in approximately 2-5% of HTLV-1 carriers after a prolonged latency of decades.
  ATLL is endemic in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, parts of South America,
  and sub-Saharan Africa. The HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein is the primary driver of
  transformation, activating NF-kappaB and CREB pathways, inducing genomic instability,
  and impairing DNA repair. ATLL cells characteristically display a CD4+CD25+ regulatory
  T-cell phenotype with flower-shaped nuclear morphology.

  description: >-
    HTLV-1 is a deltaretrovirus that infects CD4+ T cells. Transmission occurs
    through breastfeeding, sexual contact, blood transfusion, and injection drug
    use. After infection, HTLV-1 integrates into the host genome and establishes
    lifelong persistent infection. The viral Tax protein is the major transforming
    factor, activating NF-kappaB, inducing genomic instability, and promoting
    T-cell proliferation. HBZ (HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor) expressed from
    the antisense strand also contributes to leukemogenesis.

pathophysiology:
- name: HTLV-1 Infection and Tax Oncoprotein Expression
  description: >-
    HTLV-1 preferentially infects CD4+ T cells and integrates into the host genome.
    The viral Tax protein is the primary driver of transformation, functioning as
    a transcriptional activator that hijacks multiple cellular pathways. Tax activates
    NF-kappaB, CREB/ATF, and AP-1 transcription factors, driving T-cell proliferation
    and survival.

  description: >-
    Tax activates both canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB pathways through
    direct interaction with IKK complex and NIK. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation
    drives expression of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL-XL, cIAP, survivin), cytokines

    Tax impairs multiple DNA repair pathways including nucleotide excision repair,

    screening followed by Western blot confirmation.

    Quantification of HTLV-1 proviral DNA by PCR. High proviral load is
    associated with increased risk of ATLL development.

    Useful for monitoring disease activity.
genetic:
- name: HTLV-1 Tax
  association: Viral Oncogene
  notes: >-
    Tax is the major HTLV-1 transforming protein. Activates NF-kappaB, CREB,
    and AP-1 pathways; induces genomic instability; inhibits DNA repair;
    and dysregulates cell cycle. Tax expression is often lost in established
    ATLL due to promoter methylation, suggesting its role is primarily in
    early transformation.
- name: HTLV-1 HBZ
  association: Viral Oncogene
  notes: >-
    HBZ (HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor) is expressed from the antisense
    strand and maintained in all ATLL cells. Promotes T-cell proliferation
    and regulatory T-cell phenotype. Contributes to transformation
    independently of Tax.
- name: TP53
  association: Somatic Mutation
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in approximately 20-40% of aggressive ATLL and
    are associated with poor prognosis. More common in acute than
    indolent forms.
- name: CCR4
  association: Gain of Function Mutation
  notes: >-
    CCR4 mutations occur in approximately 25% of cases and result in
    receptor stabilization and enhanced signaling. Target of mogamulizumab
    therapy.
