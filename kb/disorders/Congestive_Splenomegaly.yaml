- name: Hepatic Congestive Splenomegaly
  description: >
    Splenomegaly secondary to portal hypertension from liver cirrhosis or
    other hepatic causes of increased portal venous pressure.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:36908126
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "As liver disease progresses, intrahepatic vascular resistance increases (backward flow theory of portal hypertension) and collateral veins develop."
    explanation: Hepatic congestive splenomegaly arises from progressive intrahepatic vascular resistance in liver disease, which transmits elevated pressure to the splenic vein.
- name: Extrahepatic Congestive Splenomegaly
  description: >
    Splenomegaly due to extrahepatic portal vein obstruction, splenic vein
    thrombosis, or other non-hepatic causes of venous congestion.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:27860293
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "insufficient platelet recovery after relief of portal hypertension by shunt procedures or minor and transient recovery after splenic artery embolization have caused many to question the importance and relative contribution of this mechanism to thrombocytopenia."
    explanation: Extrahepatic causes of portal hypertension, including portal vein obstruction, produce splenomegaly through venous outflow impedance independent of hepatic pathology.
pathophysiology:
- name: Portal and Splenic Venous Congestion
  description: >
    Elevated portal venous pressure, most commonly from liver cirrhosis,
    transmits back through the splenic vein to the spleen. As intrahepatic
    vascular resistance increases (backward flow), compensatory splanchnic
    vasodilation increases portal inflow (forward flow), creating a local
    hyperdynamic state around the spleen. The splenic artery resistance
    index is selectively elevated in cirrhotic patients. Splenic vein
    thrombosis can produce isolated left-sided portal hypertension with
    the same congestion effect.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "As liver disease progresses, intrahepatic vascular resistance increases (backward flow theory of portal hypertension) and collateral veins develop. Adequate portal hypertension is required to maintain portal flow into the liver through an increase in blood flow into the portal venous system (forward flow theory of portal hypertension). The splenic artery resistance index is significantly and selectively elevated in cirrhotic patients. In portal hypertension, a local hyperdynamic state occurs around the spleen."
    explanation: This review establishes the hemodynamic basis of congestive splenomegaly through the backward and forward flow theories of portal hypertension and the selective elevation of splenic artery resistance.
  - reference: PMID:24679494
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Portal hypertension is a major complication of liver disease that results from a variety of pathologic conditions that increase the resistance to the portal blood flow into the liver. As portal hypertension develops, the formation of collateral vessels and arterial vasodilation progresses, which results in increased blood flow to the portal circulation."
    explanation: This review explains that increased intrahepatic resistance combined with splanchnic vasodilation and increased portal blood flow drives portal hypertension and consequent splenic congestion.
  - reference: PMID:11926560
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The increase in spleen size is followed by an increase in splenic blood flow, which participates in portal hypertension actively congesting the portal system."
    explanation: Demonstrates that splenomegaly itself contributes to portal hypertension through increased splenic blood flow, creating a positive feedback loop of congestion.
  downstream:
  - target: Red Pulp Congestion and Fibrosis
    description: >
      Sustained venous congestion and hyperdynamic splenic inflow cause
      chronic red pulp engorgement, activating macrophages and inducing
      progressive fibrosis of splenic cords.
- name: Red Pulp Congestion and Fibrosis
  description: >
    Chronic venous congestion leads to progressive changes in splenic
    architecture. The red pulp becomes engorged with erythrocytes, and
    the macrophagic system is activated with histiocyte hyperplasia.
    Reticular fibers increase and myofibroblasts proliferate in the
    splenic cords, driven by oxidative stress and TGF-beta signaling.
    Over time, diffuse fibrosis develops throughout the parenchyma. The
    degree of fibrosis correlates with severity of thrombocytopenia and
    splenomegaly. Repeated microhemorrhages deposit hemosiderin and
    calcium, forming characteristic Gamma-Gandy bodies.

    snippet: "In course of experimental pre-hepatic portal hypertension in the rat, the most important histological alterations in the spleen, are represented by pooling of blood in the red pulp, activation of the macrophagic system, with hyperplasia of the histiocytes, increase of reticular fibers and of subcapsular myo-fibroblasts, and finally by evolution towards a diffuse fibrosis all over the parenchyma."
    explanation: This experimental model of congestive splenomegaly directly demonstrates the sequence of pathological changes from red pulp congestion through macrophage activation to diffuse fibrosis.

    snippet: "In addition to splenic sinus congestion, diffuse fibrosis was detected in the splenic cords in the red pulp of patients with PH. The degree of the fibrosis was well correlated with severity in thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly."

  - reference: PMID:32945524
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Cells expressing α-smooth muscle actin dramatically increased in the splenic cord. Cytoglobin (Cygb) expression was detected in human splenic cords as reported in animal reticular cells, and fluorescent double immunostaining revealed that these cells expressed α-smooth muscle actin in patients with PH, suggesting transformation of Cygb-expressing cells to myofibroblastic cells."
    explanation: Identifies the cellular mechanism of splenic fibrosis through myofibroblastic transformation of cytoglobin-expressing cells in the splenic cords.
  - reference: PMID:11926560

    snippet: "In this condition, splenomegaly is not only caused by portal congestion, but it is mainly due to tissue hyperplasia and fibrosis."
    explanation: Establishes that congestive splenomegaly involves active tissue remodeling (hyperplasia and fibrosis) beyond passive venous congestion.
  downstream:
  - target: Hypersplenism
    description: >
      Progressive red pulp fibrosis and macrophage hyperactivation increase
      sequestration and phagocytic destruction of circulating blood cells,
      producing the cytopenias of hypersplenism.
- name: Hypersplenism
  description: >
    The enlarged, congested spleen excessively sequesters and destroys
    circulating blood cells. Platelets are most affected due to splenic
    pooling, but red blood cells and white blood cells are also trapped
    and destroyed, leading to varying degrees of pancytopenia. Reduced
    hepatic thrombopoietin production in chronic liver disease further
    compounds the thrombocytopenia. Increased splenic macrophage activity
    and immune-mediated mechanisms accelerate blood cell destruction.

    snippet: "Thrombopoietin is predominantly produced by the liver and is reduced when liver cell mass is severely damaged. This leads to reduced thrombopoiesis in the bone marrow and consequently to thrombocytopenia in the peripheral blood of patients with advanced-stage liver disease."

  - reference: PMID:41306370
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Increased platelet destruction occurs due to splenic sequestration caused by hypersplenism or immune-mediated conditions. Decreased platelet production results from a decline in thrombopoietin production, bone marrow suppression by medications, or toxic insults."
    explanation: Recent comprehensive review confirming the dual mechanism of both increased platelet destruction (hypersplenism) and decreased production (reduced thrombopoietin) in portal hypertension.
