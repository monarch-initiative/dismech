    snippet: Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare dominantly inherited
      neurodegenerative disorder... As is expected in a case of childhood-onset
      HD, our patient is rapidly deteriorating and is currently in the terminal
      phase of his illness along with resistant convulsions.
    explanation: The abstract describes a case of childhood-onset Huntington's
      disease that progresses rapidly, supporting the statement.

    snippet: Juvenile-onset Huntington's disease (JOHD) is a rare form of
      Huntington's disease (HD) characterized by symptom onset before the age of
      21 years... The mean annualized decrease in striatal volume in the JOHD
      group was -3.99% compared to -0.06% in the GNE.
    explanation: The abstract confirms that Juvenile Huntington's Disease is
      rare, begins early, and progresses rapidly, supporting the statement.

    snippet: The presentation of juvenile Huntington's disease can cause
      diagnostic difficulties. The genetics and pathogenesis of the condition
      are discussed.
    explanation: The abstract acknowledges the existence of juvenile
      Huntington's disease, which supports the statement.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Of 195 cases of juvenile Huntington disease gathered from case
      descriptions... It is argued that juvenile Huntington disease should not
      be regarded as a separate clinical entity, but as a manifestation of the
      rigid variant of the disease.
    explanation: The abstract discusses juvenile Huntington's disease and its
      characteristics, supporting the statement.
- name: Late-Onset Huntington's Disease
  description: Typically begins after the age of 50 and may have a slower
    progression.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:28671137
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: 'BACKGROUND: Although the typical age of onset for Huntington''s disease
      (HD) is in the fourth decade, between 4.4-11.5% of individuals with HD have
      a late onset (over 60 years of age).'
    explanation: The statement that Huntington's Disease typically begins after
      the age of 50 is not entirely accurate. While late-onset Huntington's
      Disease (LoHD) does occur, the typical age of onset for HD is in the
      fourth decade. However, the statement is partially supported by the fact
      that some individuals do experience late onset, and LoHD may have a slower
      progression.

    snippet: Huntington's disease may present at any age, but most typically
      manifests between the ages of 35 and 45 years as a slowly progressive
      neurodegenerative movement disorder with cognitive and behavioral
      impairment.
    explanation: This reference refutes the statement that Huntington's Disease
      typically begins after the age of 50. It states that HD most typically
      manifests between the ages of 35 and 45 years.

      which is not relevant to the claim about typical onset after the age of

prevalence:
- population: Global
  percentage: 0.004-0.01
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:1535611
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: It is concluded that most European populations, both Northern and
      Southern, show a relatively high prevalence (4-8 per 100,000), and that
      the disorder may also be frequent in India and parts of central Asia. HD
      is notably rare in Finland and in Japan, but data for Eastern Asia and
      Africa are inadequate.
    explanation: The prevalence of Huntington's Disease varies significantly
      across different regions, with some populations showing higher prevalence
      and others showing lower. Therefore, a global percentage of 0.004-0.01 may
      not accurately reflect the variability seen in different regions.

      discovery unleased a flurry of experimentation that has established the
      expanded CAG repeat the almost universal cause of the characteristic
      neurologic symptoms and pathology of this neurodegenerative disorder of

    explanation: The reference confirms that an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT
      gene is the cause of Huntington's Disease.
  - reference: PMID:35395060

    snippet: Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of the CAG
      trinucleotide repeat domain in the huntingtin gene that results in
      expression of a mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) containing an expanded
      polyglutamine tract in the amino terminus.
    explanation: The literature clearly states that HD is caused by an expanded
      CAG repeat in the HTT gene, leading to a mutant huntingtin protein with an
      abnormal polyglutamine tract.
