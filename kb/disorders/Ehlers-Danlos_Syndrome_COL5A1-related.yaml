description: >-
  A hereditary connective tissue disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the COL5A1 gene,
  which encodes the alpha-1 chain of type V collagen. This form accounts for approximately
  50% of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome cases and is characterized by skin hyperextensibility,
  fragile and soft skin, delayed wound healing with formation of atrophic scars, easy
  bruising, and generalized joint hypermobility. The disease follows autosomal dominant
  inheritance with variable expressivity.

  description: Regular evaluation for mitral valve prolapse and other cardiovascular complications.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:21193204
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Echocardiography may still be warranted as part of cardiovascular assessment, but decreased frequency of screening is recommended especially in symptom-free adults.
    explanation: This reference supports cardiovascular monitoring in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, particularly for mitral valve prolapse and aortic dilation.
  - reference: PMID:15607555
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: This proposal is specifically concerned with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome classic type (formerly Types I-III), which is characterized by ... cardiac mitral valve prolapse.
    explanation: Supports cardiovascular phenotype association, but only partially supports ongoing monitoring recommendations.

    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: 'CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: EDS HM and other subtypes should be considered in patients with chronic functional GI symptoms and abdominal vascular lesions.'
    explanation: Snippet supports GI symptom burden in EDS, but does not directly provide treatment evidence for gastrointestinal management.

  description: Avoiding high-impact activities and contact sports to prevent injury, and using protective gear when necessary.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:17067502
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Preparticipation cardiothoracic and orthopedic screening is highly recommended for athletes with EDS, and appropriate cardiovascular, orthopedic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and dermatologic management can often allow patients with EDS to remain active.
    explanation: The literature emphasizes careful screening and multidisciplinary management for athletes with EDS, which implicitly supports the avoidance of high-impact activities to prevent injuries but does not explicitly mention the use of protective gear or contact sports.
  - reference: PMID:32899328
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: The major clinical manifestations of EDS include joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and generalized connective tissue fragility. ... These findings allow healthcare providers to know more about this disease in order to support and give advice to patients about the changes they will have to make.
    explanation: The study highlights the importance of providing advice to patients about lifestyle changes due to EDS but does not specifically mention avoiding high-impact activities or using protective gear.
