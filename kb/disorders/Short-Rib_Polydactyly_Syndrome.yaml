name: Short-Rib Polydactyly Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Short-rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS) are a group of autosomal recessive lethal
  skeletal ciliopathies characterized by extremely short ribs, narrow thorax,
  short limbs, polydactyly, and multiorgan abnormalities. They represent the
  severe end of the short-rib thoracic dysplasia spectrum, with Jeune syndrome
  at the milder end. Multiple genetic subtypes are recognized, all involving
  genes required for intraflagellar transport or ciliogenesis. Death typically
  occurs in the perinatal period from respiratory insufficiency.

          Short-rib polydactyly (SRP) syndrome type III, or Verma-Naumoff syndrome, is an

pathophysiology:
  - name: Intraflagellar Transport and Ciliogenesis Defects
    description: >
      SRPS are caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the
      intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, dynein motor complexes,
      and basal body proteins. These mutations disrupt primary cilium
      assembly and maintenance, producing structurally abnormal cilia
      (shortened, bulbous tips) or reduced cilia number.

  - name: Hedgehog Signaling Disruption in Skeletal Development
    description: >
      Primary cilia are essential for transduction of Hedgehog signaling,
      which is critical for endochondral ossification and limb patterning.
      Ciliary dysfunction from IFT/dynein defects disrupts Hedgehog-dependent
      chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, leading to severe skeletal
      shortening and polydactyly. The skeletal and organ phenotypes in SRPS
      are more severe than in Jeune syndrome, reflecting a greater degree of
      ciliary dysfunction.
