name: CADASIL Type 1
description: >-
  Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and
  Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary small vessel disease caused by
  mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. It is the most common monogenic cause of stroke
  and vascular dementia in adults. The disease is characterized by recurrent
  ischemic strokes, progressive cognitive decline, migraine with aura, and
  psychiatric disturbances. Pathologically, it involves progressive degeneration
  of vascular smooth muscle cells in small arteries, abnormal accumulation of the
  NOTCH3 extracellular domain (ECD) as granular osmiophilic material (GOM), and
  co-deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, leading to thickening of
  vessel walls and luminal narrowing.

    description: >-
      Mutations in NOTCH3, primarily missense mutations affecting cysteine
      residues in the extracellular EGF-like repeat domains, lead to abnormal
      NOTCH3 extracellular domain (ECD) multimerization and accumulation in
      small vessel walls. Wild-type and mutant NOTCH3 ECD co-aggregate, and
      this co-aggregation is a major driver of arterial pathology and vascular
      smooth muscle cell loss.

          wild-type Notch3ECD coaggregated with mutant Notch3ECD and that
          elimination of 1 copy of wild-type Notch3 in TgNotch3R169C was
          sufficient to attenuate Notch3ECD accumulation and arterial pathology.
          These findings suggest that Notch3ECD accumulation, involving mutant
          and wild-type NOTCH3, is a major driver of arterial SMC loss in
          CADASIL, paving the way for NOTCH3-lowering therapeutic strategies.

          This study demonstrates that wild-type and mutant NOTCH3 ECD
          co-aggregate, and that reducing wild-type NOTCH3 attenuates both
          ECD accumulation and arterial pathology in a mouse model, supporting
