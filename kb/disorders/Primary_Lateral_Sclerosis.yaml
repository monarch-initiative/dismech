    label: lateral sclerosis
description: >-
  Primary lateral sclerosis is a progressive upper motor neuron disorder with
  insidious onset and slow progression.
pathophysiology:
- name: Progressive Upper Motor Neuron Dysfunction
  description: >-
    Degeneration of upper motor neurons leads to slowly progressive spasticity
    and motor impairment without lower motor neuron signs.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26515619
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Primary lateral sclerosis is characterized by insidious onset of progressive
      upper motor neuron dysfunction in the absence of clinical signs of lower motor
      neuron involvement."
    explanation: The abstract defines PLS by progressive upper motor neuron
      dysfunction.
- name: Corticospinal Tract Degeneration
  description: >-
    Neuropathology shows degeneration of the primary motor cortex and
    corticospinal tracts with relative preservation of lower motor neurons.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:33602010
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Degeneration of the primary motor cortex and corticospinal tracts with
      preservation of lower motor neurons (LMN) has been reported in most cases."
    explanation: The abstract describes cortical and corticospinal degeneration
      with LMN preservation.
phenotypes:
- name: Spasticity
  category: Neurologic
  frequency: COMMON
  phenotype_term:
    preferred_term: Spasticity
    term:
      id: HP:0001257
      label: Spasticity
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26515619
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Patients experience stiffness; decreased balance and coordination; mild
      weakness; and, if the bulbar region is affected, difficulty speaking and swallowing,
      and emotional lability."
    explanation: Stiffness in the abstract reflects spasticity in PLS.
- name: Dysarthria
  category: Neurologic
  frequency: COMMON
  phenotype_term:
    preferred_term: Dysarthria
    term:
      id: HP:0001260
      label: Dysarthria
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26515619
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Patients experience stiffness; decreased balance and coordination; mild
      weakness; and, if the bulbar region is affected, difficulty speaking and swallowing,
      and emotional lability."
    explanation: Difficulty speaking is consistent with dysarthria in PLS.
- name: Dysphagia
  category: Neurologic
  frequency: COMMON
  phenotype_term:
    preferred_term: Dysphagia
    term:
      id: HP:0002015
      label: Dysphagia
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26515619
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Patients experience stiffness; decreased balance and coordination; mild
      weakness; and, if the bulbar region is affected, difficulty speaking and swallowing,
      and emotional lability."
    explanation: The abstract notes difficulty swallowing when bulbar regions
      are affected.
treatments:
- name: Supportive Care
  description: Symptomatic management and supportive interventions.
  treatment_term:
    preferred_term: supportive care
    term:
      id: MAXO:0000950
      label: supportive care
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26515619
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Treatment is largely supportive."
    explanation: The abstract states that management is supportive.
