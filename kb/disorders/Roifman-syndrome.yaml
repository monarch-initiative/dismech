    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Roifman Syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by growth retardation, cognitive delay, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and antibody deficiency. Here we utilize whole-genome sequencing of Roifman Syndrome patients to reveal compound heterozygous rare variants that disrupt highly conserved positions of the RNU4ATAC small nuclear RNA gene, a minor spliceosome component that is essential for minor intron splicing.
    explanation: The study confirms that mutations in the RNU4ATAC gene disrupt the minor spliceosome, leading to defective minor intron splicing, which aligns with the statement.
  - reference: PMID:36802443
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Its noncoding gene, RNU4ATAC, has been found mutated in Taybi-Linder (TALS/microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 1), Roifman (RFMN), and Lowry-Wood (LWS) syndromes. These rare developmental disorders, whose physiopathological mechanisms remain unsolved, associate ante- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly, skeletal dysplasia, intellectual disability, retinal dystrophy, and immunodeficiency.
    explanation: The literature confirms that mutations in the RNU4ATAC gene are associated with Roifman syndrome and disrupt the minor spliceosome, affecting cellular processes.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:24837766

    snippet: As infections condition the final prognosis of most PIDs, clearly defined prophylactic practices are essential. In most cases, intravenously or subcutaneously administered immunoglobulin remains the mainstay of treatment, although antibiotics and antifungals can be added under some conditions, particularly when the infections are highly recurrent despite immunoglobulin replacement. Vaccines could also play a role, but their administration leads to different results depending on the type of PID.
    explanation: The literature suggests that vaccines could play a role in managing primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) like Roifman syndrome, but the response to vaccines can vary depending on the specific type of immunodeficiency.
