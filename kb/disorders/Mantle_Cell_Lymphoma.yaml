name: Mantle Cell Lymphoma
description: >-
  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized
  by the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, which juxtaposes the CCND1 (cyclin D1) gene
  with the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer, leading to constitutive cyclin D1
  overexpression. MCL typically presents at advanced stage with lymphadenopathy,
  bone marrow involvement, and frequently gastrointestinal tract infiltration. While
  historically considered incurable with median survival of 3-5 years, outcomes have
  improved with BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib), high-dose therapy with
  stem cell transplant in younger patients, and emerging therapies including CAR-T cells.

has_subtypes:
- name: Classical Mantle Cell Lymphoma
  description: >-
    The predominant form characterized by monotonous small to medium-sized
    lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours. Typically presents with
    widespread nodal and extranodal disease. Aggressive clinical course
    requiring treatment.
- name: Leukemic Non-Nodal Mantle Cell Lymphoma
  description: >-
    Indolent variant presenting with splenomegaly, bone marrow involvement,
    and peripheral blood disease without significant lymphadenopathy.
    Often SOX11-negative with IGHV mutations. May be managed with
    observation initially.
- name: Blastoid Mantle Cell Lymphoma
  description: >-
    Aggressive morphologic variant with blastoid or pleomorphic features,
    high proliferation rate, and worse prognosis. May arise de novo or
    from transformation of classical MCL. Often harbors TP53 mutations.
pathophysiology:
- name: CCND1 Translocation and Cyclin D1 Overexpression
  description: >-
    The t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation places the CCND1 gene under control of
    the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer, causing constitutive overexpression
    of cyclin D1. This is the hallmark genetic event in MCL, occurring in virtually
    all cases, and drives cell cycle progression.

    description: Cyclin D1 drives progression through G1/S checkpoint
- name: Cell Cycle Dysregulation
  description: >-
    Cyclin D1 overexpression accelerates G1 to S phase transition by activating
    CDK4/6, which phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein (RB1) and releases E2F
    transcription factors. This overcomes normal cell cycle checkpoints and
    drives proliferation.

- name: BTK and BCR Signaling Dependence
  description: >-
    MCL cells are dependent on B-cell receptor signaling through BTK for survival.
    This pathway provides proliferative and anti-apoptotic signals essential for
    MCL cell maintenance. BTK inhibitors exploit this dependence, particularly
    effective in relapsed MCL.

    Constitutive NF-kB signaling is common in MCL, driven by BCR signaling and

biochemical:
- name: Cyclin D1 Expression
  notes: >-
    Immunohistochemistry for cyclin D1 (CCND1) is positive in virtually all MCL
    cases and is essential for diagnosis. SOX11 expression helps distinguish
    classical from leukemic non-nodal variants.

  notes: >-
    MCL cells are CD5+, CD19+, CD20+, CD23-, FMC7+, with moderate to strong
    surface immunoglobulin. The CD5+ CD23- phenotype helps distinguish from
    CLL which is typically CD23+.

  notes: >-
    The t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation is the hallmark of MCL, present in
    virtually all cases. It places CCND1 under IGH enhancer control, causing
    cyclin D1 overexpression. Detected by FISH, karyotype, or cyclin D1 IHC.
- name: TP53 Mutation
  association: Adverse Prognostic Marker
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in 20-30% of MCL and are associated with aggressive
    biology, blastoid morphology, and poor response to chemotherapy. May
    retain sensitivity to BTK inhibitors and novel agents.
- name: ATM Mutation/Deletion
