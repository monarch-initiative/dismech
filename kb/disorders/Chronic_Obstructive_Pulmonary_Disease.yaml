progression:
- phase: Onset
  notes: Typically begins in individuals over the age of 40.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26154786
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Among 657 persons who had an FEV1 of less than 80% of the predicted
      value before 40 years of age, 174 (26%) had COPD after 22 years of
      observation, whereas among 2207 persons who had a baseline FEV1 of at
      least 80% of the predicted value before 40 years of age, 158 (7%) had COPD
      after 22 years of observation.
    explanation: The literature suggests that COPD can develop in individuals
      with low FEV1 before the age of 40. While this supports the idea that COPD
      typically begins in individuals over 40, it also indicates that it can
      start earlier in some cases.
  - reference: PMID:19934351
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: There is growing evidence of higher prevalence of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the elderly. Age-associated
      changes in the structure and function of the lung may increase a
      pathogenetic susceptibility to COPD.
    explanation: This reference supports the statement that COPD typically
      begins in individuals over the age of 40, particularly due to
      age-associated changes in lung structure and function.

review_notes: COPD is characterized by progressive airflow obstruction that is
  not fully reversible. Key respiratory symptoms include dyspnea, chronic cough,
  sputum production, and wheezing. As the disease progresses, patients may
  develop signs of lung hyperinflation (barrel chest) and are at risk for
  respiratory failure. Systemic effects like fatigue and weight loss are also
  common, particularly in advanced disease.
