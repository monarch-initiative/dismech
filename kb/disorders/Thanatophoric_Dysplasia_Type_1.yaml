description: >
  Thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 (TD1) is a severe, usually lethal skeletal dysplasia
  caused by heterozygous FGFR3 mutations, most commonly R248C. It is characterized
  by
  extreme rhizomelic limb shortening with curved (bowed) femurs, narrow thorax causing
  pulmonary hypoplasia, platyspondyly, and macrocephaly. Cloverleaf skull (kleeblattschadel)
  may occur but is more common in type 2. The term "thanatophoric" means "death-bearing"
  in Greek, reflecting the typically perinatal lethality due to respiratory insufficiency.
  Rare long-term survivors have been reported with intensive respiratory support.

inheritance:
- name: Autosomal dominant (de novo)
  description: >
    Virtually all cases arise from de novo heterozygous mutations. Germline mosaicism
    has been reported, leading to rare recurrences in siblings.
pathophysiology:
- name: Severe FGFR3 gain-of-function
  description: >
    TD1 mutations cause severe constitutive activation of FGFR3, leading to profound
    inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in the growth plate.
    The R248C mutation in the extracellular domain causes ligand-independent receptor
    dimerization and activation. This results in severely shortened and disorganized
    growth plates with minimal longitudinal bone growth.

notes: >
  Thanatophoric dysplasia is typically diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound showing
  severe limb shortening, narrow thorax, and macrocephaly. Molecular testing can
  confirm the diagnosis and distinguish type 1 from type 2. The distinction has
  prognostic implications for recurrence risk counseling (both are typically de novo,
  but specific mutation identification aids genetic counseling). TD1 and TD2 together
  represent the severe end of the FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia spectrum, contrasting
  with the viable achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia.
