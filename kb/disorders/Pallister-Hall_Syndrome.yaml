name: Pallister-Hall Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by
  truncating mutations in the middle third of the GLI3 gene. These mutations
  produce a constitutive transcriptional repressor that inappropriately suppresses
  Hedgehog target genes, causing a distinct phenotype from the allelic disorder
  Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. PHS is characterized by hypothalamic
  hamartoma, postaxial or central polydactyly, bifid epiglottis, anal atresia,
  and variable other malformations. Severity ranges from lethal neonatal forms
  to mild adult presentations.

    description: >
      Autosomal dominant with variable expressivity. Unlike GCPS which
      results from GLI3 haploinsufficiency, PHS is caused specifically by
      frameshift/nonsense mutations in the middle third of GLI3 that
      produce a truncated constitutive repressor protein.

pathophysiology:
  - name: GLI3 Constitutive Repressor from Truncating Mutations
    description: >
      Truncating mutations in the middle third of GLI3 (ORF nt 1998-3481)
      produce a protein that retains the N-terminal zinc finger DNA-binding
      domain and repressor domain but lacks the C-terminal transactivation
      domain. This truncated protein functions as a constitutive repressor
      of Hedgehog target genes, independent of Hedgehog signaling input.

    description: >
      Constitutive GLI3 repressor activity inappropriately silences Hedgehog
      target genes required for hypothalamic development, leading to

      from the preaxial polydactyly seen in GCPS, where GLI3 haploinsufficiency
      (reduced activator) rather than constitutive repressor drives the phenotype.

genetic:
  - name: GLI3 Mutations (Truncating, Middle Third)
    association: Causative
    notes: >
      Frameshift and nonsense mutations in the middle third of GLI3
      (ORF nt 1998-3481) on chromosome 7p14.1 specifically cause PHS.
      These produce a truncated protein that functions as a constitutive
      repressor of Hedgehog signaling targets. This is in contrast to
      GCPS, where mutations throughout the gene cause haploinsufficiency.
      The genotype-phenotype correlation is robust across multiple
      large cohort studies.
