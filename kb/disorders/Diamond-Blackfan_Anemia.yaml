pathophysiology:
- name: Ribosomal Protein Haploinsufficiency
  description: >
    Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in ribosomal protein genes
    reduce ribosome assembly and protein synthesis capacity. Erythroid
    progenitors are exquisitely sensitive to ribosomal stress due to
    their high proliferative and translational demands. RPS19 mutations
    account for ~25% of cases, with RPL5, RPL11, and other RP genes
    collectively explaining ~65-70% of DBA.

    triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis preferentially in erythroid
    progenitors, resulting in selective red cell aplasia.

  description: >
    A distinct non-ribosomal mechanism causing DBA. GATA1 is an X-linked
    erythroid transcription factor essential for erythroid differentiation.
    Mutations in GATA1 (including splice site variants) reduce functional
    GATA1 protein levels, impairing erythroid gene expression. Unlike
    ribosomal protein mutations, GATA1 mutations directly affect erythroid
    transcription rather than global translation, but converge on the same
    erythroid differentiation failure.
