description: 'Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism, most commonly caused
  by deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). The metabolic block at the transsulfuration branchpoint of methionine
  metabolism causes accumulation of homocysteine and upstream metabolites (methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine)
  with depletion of downstream products (cystathionine, cysteine). Elevated homocysteine drives multisystem disease through
  oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein modifications via homocysteine thiolactone, endothelial dysfunction
  with thrombosis, and NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity. Clinical features include ectopia lentis, skeletal abnormalities
  with marfanoid habitus, thromboembolism, and cognitive impairment. Disease severity is strongly modified by pyridoxine (vitamin
  B6) responsiveness.

    snippet: A nutritional approach to HHcy management involves implementing dietary strategies and targeted supplementation,
      emphasizing key nutrients like vitamin B6, B12, and folate that are crucial for Hcy conversion.
    explanation: Directly supports folate and B12 supplementation as part of nutritional HHcy management.
- name: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
  description: 'CBS-based enzyme replacement therapy is under development. ERT has shown efficacy in lowering plasma tHcy
    below 100 micromol/L in mouse models. Efficacy can be enhanced by co-administration of biological reductants (N-acetylcysteine,
    MESNA, cysteamine) that increase the availability of reduced homocysteine as a CBS substrate.

    snippet: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) based on human CBS has been developed and has shown significant efficacy correcting
      HCU phenotype in several mouse models by bringing plasma total homocysteine below the clinically relevant 100 μM threshold.
    explanation: Directly supports the quantitative ERT efficacy claim in mouse models.

  description: 'Anticoagulation and thromboprophylaxis measures are important for managing vascular risk in HCU. Specific
    considerations include avoiding oral contraceptives, prophylactic anticoagulation during high-risk periods (surgery, pregnancy),

    snippet: Genetic defects in the synthesis, catabolism or transport of amino acids underlie a diverse class of diseases
      known as inborn errors of amino acid metabolism.
    explanation: Autosomal recessive genetic etiology of HCU supports the role of genetic counseling.
notes: 'Classical CBS-deficient homocystinuria shows marked clinical heterogeneity largely driven by pyridoxine responsiveness.
  Non-responsive patients typically present in childhood with multisystem disease including lens dislocation, skeletal abnormalities,
  intellectual disability, and early thrombosis. Pyridoxine-responsive patients may present in adulthood, sometimes solely
  with thromboembolic events. Newborn screening via methionine on tandem MS has known sensitivity limitations, particularly
  for milder pyridoxine-responsive forms. Direct tHcy measurement in NBS is used in some programs (e.g., Qatar) but is not
  widely implemented. NBS-based global incidence estimates for classical HCU are approximately 1 in 200,000 to 1 in 340,000,
  though underestimation is likely. A 2024 US claims-based study estimated average annual standardized prevalence at 5.29
  per 100,000 (broad definition) and 1.04 per 100,000 (strict definition). Recent advances in understanding CBS protein misfolding
  and proteostasis (2023-2024) have opened potential new therapeutic avenues including proteostasis modulation and chaperone-based
  rescue strategies. Enzyme replacement therapy with CBS is in preclinical development with encouraging results in mouse models.
