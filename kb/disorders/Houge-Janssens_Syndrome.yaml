description: >
  Houge-Janssens syndrome (HJS) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders caused
  by dysfunction of protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A). PP2A is a heterotrimeric
  serine/threonine phosphatase composed of a catalytic (C), scaffolding (A), and
  regulatory (B) subunit. PP2A opposes the activity of growth-promoting kinases of
  the
  PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK pathways. Core clinical features include neurodevelopmental
  delay (especially affecting language), prolonged hypotonia, high risk of seizures,
  behavioral problems, and variable head circumference abnormalities. Four subtypes
  are
  recognized based on the affected PP2A subunit gene: HJS type 1 (PPP2R5D), HJS type
  2
  (PPP2R1A), HJS type 3 (PPP2CA), and HJS type 4 (PPP2R5C). Most pathogenic variants
  are de novo heterozygous missense changes acting through dominant-negative mechanisms.

    assembly. In PPP2R5C, variants affect substrate binding, C-subunit binding, or
    both. Catalytic activity of the phosphatase is variably affected.

  description: >
    PP2A normally opposes the activity of serine/threonine protein kinases of the

    sustained activation of these growth-promoting pathways, converging on
    mTORC1/p70S6K/RPS6 signaling. Phosphoproteomic analysis of PPP2R5D variant
    cells shows RPS6 hyperphosphorylation as a shared signaling alteration, with
    ERK-dependent mTORC1 activation in both E198K and E420K variants, and
    additional AKT-mediated mTORC1 activation in the E420K variant.

  description: >
    RASopathies including Noonan syndrome share overlapping clinical features with
    HJS due to convergence on the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which PP2A normally
    opposes. Shared features include developmental delay, macrocephaly, seizures,
    hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Congenital heart defects (especially pulmonary valve stenosis) are hallmark
    features of Noonan syndrome but not typical of HJS
  - Short stature is common in Noonan syndrome but not a core feature of HJS
  - Noonan syndrome is caused by variants in RAS/MAPK pathway genes (PTPN11,
    SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF) rather than PP2A subunit genes

    overactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Alpelisib (PI3K inhibitor) is being
    evaluated for MCAP, highlighting the shared pathway biology.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Capillary malformations and cutaneous vascular anomalies are characteristic
    of MCAP but absent in HJS
  - Polymicrogyria is a hallmark brain finding in MCAP but not typical of HJS
  - MCAP is caused by somatic mosaic PIK3CA variants rather than germline PP2A

    spectrum features with HJS.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Hamartomatous growths (trichilemmomas, intestinal polyps) are characteristic
    of PTEN syndromes but absent in HJS
  - Increased cancer risk (breast, thyroid, endometrial) is a major feature of
    PTEN syndromes but not of HJS
  - Macrocephaly in PTEN syndromes is typically more pronounced
  - PTEN mutations are loss-of-function whereas HJS variants act through
    dominant-negative mechanisms on PP2A

    intellectual disability, and seizures.
  distinguishing_features:

    Both conditions present with intellectual disability and movement abnormalities.
  distinguishing_features:
  - Severe absence of speech is characteristic of Angelman syndrome, whereas HJS
    shows delayed but not absent language
  - Happy demeanor with frequent laughter is a hallmark of Angelman syndrome
  - Caused by loss of maternal UBE3A expression on chromosome 15, not PP2A
    subunit mutations

  Houge-Janssens syndrome represents a PP2A-opathy with potential for targeted
  therapies. Allele-specific antisense oligonucleotides targeting PPP2R5D E198K
  have shown reversal of neuronal overgrowth phenotypes in iPSC-derived neurons
  (PMID:40340253). Hypothetical small-molecule approaches to alleviate substrate
  blockade or correct subunit misfolding have been proposed but not yet realized.
  Some PP2A variants are somatically recurrent in cancer, highlighting the dual

  mechanistic_category:

    notes: >
      HJS is not a classical RASopathy but is mechanistically related as a
      PP2A-opathy. PP2A directly opposes the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
      kinase pathways, so loss of PP2A function converges on the same
      downstream signaling as RASopathies. No dedicated PP2A-opathy category
      exists in the current mechanistic nosology.

      explanation: ERK/MAPK pathway activation in PPP2R5D variant cells supports
