    label: granulomatosis with polyangiitis
description: >-
  An ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis characterized by necrotizing
  granulomatous inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract and
  necrotizing glomerulonephritis. Strongly associated with anti-PR3 (c-ANCA)
  antibodies. Formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis.
pathophysiology:
- name: ANCA-Mediated Neutrophil Activation
  description: >-
    Anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) antibodies bind to primed neutrophils, causing
    activation, degranulation, and release of reactive oxygen species and
    lytic enzymes. This causes direct endothelial damage and vessel wall
    necrosis.

      The pathogenesis of AAV includes ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation,
      subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS),
      and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).

      This review confirms that ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation is a central
      pathogenic mechanism in AAV, leading to ROS release and vascular injury.

      role of the complement system in inducing pulmonary injury.
    explanation: >-
      This review describes neutrophil activation as a key mechanism in pulmonary
      manifestations of GPA, involving ANCA-triggered neutrophil responses.
- name: Granuloma Formation
  description: >-
    Granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells, epithelioid
    macrophages, and necrosis affects the respiratory tract. T cells and

      The ANCA associated vasculitides (AAVs) affect a range of internal organs including
      ear nose and throat, respiratory tract, kidneys, skin and nervous system. They include
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)
      and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).
    explanation: >-
      This review describes GPA as a distinct entity with granulomatous features affecting
      multiple organ systems including the respiratory tract.
- name: Complement Alternative Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    The alternative complement pathway amplifies inflammation in GPA.
    C5a recruits and activates neutrophils, creating a positive feedback
    loop of vascular damage.

      Mechanistically, cytokines or complement factors activate and prime neutrophils
      for ANCA-binding; thus, C5a receptor blocker has garnered attention as potential
      replacement for glucocorticoids in clinical settings.
    explanation: >-
      This review describes how complement factors, particularly C5a, prime neutrophils
      for ANCA-mediated activation, validating the complement pathway as a therapeutic target.
