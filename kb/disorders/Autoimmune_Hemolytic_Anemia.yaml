    label: autoimmune hemolytic anemia
description: >-
  An acquired hemolytic anemia caused by autoantibodies against red blood cell
  surface antigens. Classified as warm (IgG, 70-80%) or cold (IgM, cold agglutinin
  disease) based on antibody thermal amplitude. May be primary or secondary to
  underlying disease.
pathophysiology:
- name: Warm Autoantibody-Mediated Hemolysis
  description: >-
    IgG autoantibodies coat red blood cells and are recognized by Fc receptors
    on splenic macrophages, leading to extravascular hemolysis through
    phagocytosis. Partial phagocytosis creates spherocytes with reduced
    membrane.

    snippet: "Warm-antibody AIHA (wAIHA) exhibits a pan-reactive IgG autoantibody recognizing a portion of band 3 (wherein the DAT may be positive with IgG, C3d or both). Treatment involves glucocorticoids and steroid-sparing agents and may consider IVIG or monoclonal antibodies to CD20, CD38 or C1q."
    explanation: >-
      This comprehensive 2024 review confirms that warm AIHA is mediated by IgG autoantibodies
      that recognize RBC antigens like band 3, consistent with the FcR-mediated phagocytosis mechanism.

    snippet: "Tissue-resident macrophages in the spleen play a major role in the clearance of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-opsonized blood cells, as occurs in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Blood cells are phagocytosed via the Fc-γ receptors (FcγRs)"
    explanation: >-
      This study demonstrates that splenic red pulp macrophages express FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa receptors
      and are responsible for phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized RBCs in AIHA, directly supporting the
      mechanism of extravascular hemolysis in warm AIHA.
- name: Cold Agglutinin-Mediated Hemolysis
  description: >-
    IgM autoantibodies bind RBCs at low temperatures and activate complement.
    C3b-coated cells undergo extravascular hemolysis in the liver, or MAC
    formation causes intravascular hemolysis.

    snippet: "Cold-antibody AIHA due to IgMs range from cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) to cold agglutin disease (CAD). These are typically specific to the Ii blood group system, with the former (CAS) being polyclonal and the latter (CAD) being a more severe and monoclonal entity. The DAT in either case is positive only with C3d."
    explanation: >-
      This comprehensive review confirms that cold AIHA is mediated by IgM autoantibodies that
      activate the complement cascade, resulting in C3d deposition on RBCs and complement-mediated hemolysis.

    snippet: "Cold agglutinin disease is a difficult-to-treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which immunoglobulin M antibodies bind to erythrocytes and fix complement, resulting in predominantly extravascular hemolysis."
    explanation: >-
      This first-in-human trial of C1s inhibition confirms the central role of classical complement
      pathway activation in cold agglutinin disease, where IgM binding triggers complement fixation
      leading to C3b opsonization and extravascular hemolysis.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) causes predominantly extravascular hemolysis and anemia via complement activation. Sutimlimab is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody directed against classical pathway complement factor C1s."
    explanation: >-
      This clinical study demonstrates that blocking C1s (the serine protease in the C1 complex)
      effectively stops complement-mediated hemolysis in CAD, confirming that classical pathway
      activation via C1s is the key mechanism driving RBC destruction in cold agglutinin disease.
- name: B Cell Dysregulation
  description: >-
    Loss of B cell tolerance allows production of anti-RBC autoantibodies.
    In secondary AIHA, underlying conditions (lymphoma, CLL, SLE) drive
    autoantibody production.

    snippet: "Therapy is quite different, as steroids and rituximab are effective in the former, but have a lower response rate and duration in the latter."
    explanation: >-
      This 2024 review confirms that B cell-targeting therapy (rituximab, anti-CD20) is effective
      in warm AIHA, supporting the role of dysregulated B cells in autoantibody production against RBCs.
  - reference: PMID:38673882

    snippet: "Treatment involves glucocorticoids and steroid-sparing agents and may consider IVIG or monoclonal antibodies to CD20, CD38 or C1q."
    explanation: >-
      The efficacy of anti-CD20 (rituximab) and anti-CD38 (daratumumab) therapies demonstrates
      that B cells and plasma cells are the cellular sources of pathogenic autoantibodies in AIHA,
      confirming the role of B cell dysregulation in disease pathogenesis.
