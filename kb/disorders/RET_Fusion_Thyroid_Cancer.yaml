name: RET Fusion-Positive Thyroid Cancer
description: >-
  RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer is a molecularly-defined subset of papillary
  thyroid carcinoma (PTC) harboring chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET
  proto-oncogene. These fusions occur in approximately 10-20% of papillary thyroid
  cancers and are particularly enriched in radiation-induced thyroid cancer. The
  RET kinase domain is fused to various partners that provide dimerization domains,
  leading to constitutive receptor activation. Unlike RET point mutations in medullary
  thyroid cancer, RET fusions arise in thyroid follicular cells and cause papillary
  histology. Highly selective RET inhibitors selpercatinib and pralsetinib provide
  effective targeted therapy for RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer.

has_subtypes:
- name: RET/PTC1 (CCDC6-RET)
  description: >-
    Most common RET rearrangement in sporadic papillary thyroid cancer,
    accounting for approximately 60% of RET fusions. The CCDC6 partner
    provides a coiled-coil dimerization domain.
- name: RET/PTC3 (NCOA4-RET)
  description: >-
    Second most common RET rearrangement, particularly associated with
    radiation-induced thyroid cancer (Chernobyl). Often associated with
    solid variant PTC histology.
- name: Other RET Fusions
  description: >-
    Multiple other fusion partners have been identified including PRKAR1A,
    TRIM24, and others. All result in constitutive RET activation.
pathophysiology:
- name: RET Fusion and Constitutive Kinase Activation
  description: >-
    Chromosomal rearrangements fuse the RET tyrosine kinase domain with
    upstream partners that provide dimerization domains. This creates
    constitutively active chimeric proteins that signal independently of
    RET ligands (GDNF family members).

  - target: PI3K-AKT Pathway Activation
    description: RET fusion stimulates PI3K-AKT survival signaling
- name: RAS-MAPK Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    Constitutive RET kinase activation drives the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling
    cascade, promoting uncontrolled thyroid follicular cell proliferation.
    This is a major effector of RET-mediated thyroid tumorigenesis.

    term:
      id: GO:0000165
      label: MAPK cascade
- name: PI3K-AKT Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    RET activation recruits PI3K and stimulates AKT-mTOR signaling,
    promoting cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. Combined with
    MAPK activation, this drives thyroid cancer progression.
