description: >-
  BRCA-mutant prostate cancer is a molecularly-defined subset of prostate adenocarcinoma
  harboring germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which encode critical
  homologous recombination repair (HRR) proteins. BRCA2 mutations occur in approximately
  5-7% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and are associated
  with more aggressive disease, earlier onset, and increased metastatic potential.
  The identification of HRR deficiency as an actionable target led to approval of
  PARP inhibitors olaparib and rucaparib for BRCA-mutated mCRPC, representing a
  paradigm shift in precision oncology for prostate cancer.

parents:

has_subtypes:
- name: BRCA2-Mutant Prostate Cancer
  description: >-
    More common than BRCA1 mutations, occurring in approximately 5% of mCRPC.
    BRCA2 mutations confer higher sensitivity to PARP inhibitors and platinum
    chemotherapy.
- name: BRCA1-Mutant Prostate Cancer
  description: >-
    Less common than BRCA2 mutations in prostate cancer. Also predicts response
    to PARP inhibition and platinum chemotherapy.
pathophysiology:
- name: Homologous Recombination Repair Deficiency
  description: >-
    Loss of functional BRCA1 or BRCA2 impairs homologous recombination repair (HRR),
    the high-fidelity pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. This leads to
    accumulation of genomic instability and reliance on error-prone repair pathways.

    description: HRR deficiency leads to accumulation of chromosomal aberrations
  - target: Synthetic Lethality with PARP Inhibition
    description: HRR-deficient cells are exquisitely sensitive to PARP inhibition
- name: Genomic Instability
  description: >-
    HRR deficiency leads to genomic instability characterized by chromosomal
    rearrangements, copy number alterations, and mutational signatures typical
    of BRCA deficiency. This drives aggressive tumor behavior but also creates
    therapeutic vulnerabilities.

- name: Synthetic Lethality with PARP Inhibition
  description: >-
    PARP enzymes are essential for single-strand break repair. In HRR-deficient
    cells, PARP inhibition causes accumulation of double-strand breaks that cannot
    be repaired, leading to synthetic lethality and selective tumor cell death.
