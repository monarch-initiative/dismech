name: Grange syndrome
description: A rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in YY1AP1, characterized by early-onset panvascular disease with stenosis or occlusion of multiple arterial beds (cerebral, renal, abdominal, coronary), intellectual disability or developmental delay, and distinctive craniofacial and acral features (hypertelorism, micrognathia, brachysyndactyly, syndactyly). Hypertension due to renal artery involvement is common, and cardiac defects, bone fragility, and osteopenia occur with variable penetrance. YY1AP1 deficiency impairs vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation through disruption of the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex.

genetic:
  - name: YY1AP1
    association: Causal
    notes: Autosomal recessive biallelic loss-of-function mutations in YY1AP1 (YY1-associated protein 1) cause Grange syndrome. YY1AP1 encodes a ~90 kDa nuclear protein that associates with the transcription factor YY1 and is a core component of the INO80 ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex. Loss-of-function mutations impair VSMC differentiation and vascular homeostasis, leading to systemic vascular stenosis and occlusions.

review_notes: Grange syndrome is an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder with only ~16-20 documented cases internationally. The phenotype demonstrates significant variability, particularly regarding intellectual/developmental disability severity and the penetrance of cardiac anomalies (present in most but not all cases). Early-onset hypertension due to renal artery stenosis is highly characteristic. The molecular basis (YY1AP1 loss-of-function) encompasses diverse mutation types including frameshift variants, nonsense mutations, and intragenic deletions affecting chromatin remodeling and vascular smooth muscle homeostasis.
