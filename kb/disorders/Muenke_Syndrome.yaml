name: Muenke Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Muenke syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome caused by a specific heterozygous
  mutation (P250R) in FGFR3. It is characterized by uni- or bilateral coronal
  craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, hearing loss, and brachydactyly. Unlike
  most other FGFR3 disorders (achondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia), Muenke
  syndrome primarily affects the skull rather than the long bones. Phenotypic
  expression is highly variable, with some mutation carriers being clinically
  unaffected.

        explanation: >-
          This international multicenter study of 106 patients from 71 families
          documented that 15% of individuals with the FGFR3 P250R mutation did
          not have craniosynostosis, demonstrating reduced penetrance.
pathophysiology:
  - name: FGFR3 Gain-of-Function in Cranial Sutures
    description: >
      The P250R mutation in FGFR3 causes altered ligand binding specificity,
      allowing aberrant activation by non-cognate FGF ligands. In cranial
      sutures, this leads to premature osteogenic differentiation and suture
      fusion. The mechanism differs from achondroplasia-type mutations that
      affect growth plate chondrocytes.

        snippet: "Recent evidence suggests that the phenotypic differences may be due to specific alleles with varying degrees of ligand-independent activation, allowing the receptor to be constitutively active."
        explanation: >-
          This review explains that FGFR3 mutations cause varying degrees of
          constitutive receptor activation, which underlies the pathophysiology
          of Muenke syndrome and related FGFR3 disorders.
genetic:
  - name: FGFR3 P250R Mutation
    association: Causative
    notes: >
      A single recurrent mutation, c.749C>G (p.Pro250Arg), in FGFR3 causes all
      cases. This mutation is analogous to the P253R mutation in FGFR2 that
      causes Apert syndrome, affecting the homologous position in the Ig-II/III
      linker region. The mutation alters FGF ligand binding specificity.

        snippet: >-
          Here we present 61 individuals from 20 unrelated families where
          coronal synostosis is due to an amino acid substitution (Pro250Arg)
          that results from a single point mutation in the fibroblast growth
          factor receptor 3 gene on chromosome 4p.
        explanation: >-
          This is the original paper defining Muenke syndrome, demonstrating
          that the P250R mutation in FGFR3 is the causative mutation in all
          cases of this craniosynostosis syndrome.
