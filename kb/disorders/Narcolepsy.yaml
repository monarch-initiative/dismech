  description: With cataplexy and orexin/hypocretin deficiency.
- name: Narcolepsy Type 2
  description: Without cataplexy, normal or near-normal orexin levels.
pathophysiology:
- name: Orexin/Hypocretin Deficiency
  description: >
    Loss of orexin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus leads to
    instability of sleep-wake states. Orexin normally promotes and stabilizes
    wakefulness. In Type 1 narcolepsy, >90% of orexin neurons are destroyed,
    likely through autoimmune mechanisms.

    snippet: "Narcolepsy with cataplexy is caused by hypocretin deficiency owing to destruction of most of the hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus."
    explanation: Landmark review establishes hypocretin neuron loss as the cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy.
- name: Autoimmune Destruction
  description: >
    Strong HLA-DQB1*06:02 association suggests autoimmune etiology. T-cell
    mediated destruction of hypocretin neurons is the leading hypothesis.
    Environmental triggers (infections, H1N1 vaccination) may initiate
    the autoimmune response in genetically susceptible individuals.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:25728441
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The hypothesis that a targeted immune-mediated or autoimmune attack causes the specific degeneration of hypocretin neurons arose mainly through the discovery of genetic associations, first with the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele and then with the T-cell receptor α locus."
    explanation: Genetic associations with HLA and TCR loci strongly support autoimmune etiology.

    snippet: "Narcolepsy type 1 is hypothesized to be an autoimmune disease targeting the hypocretin/orexin neurons in the hypothalamus. Ample genetic and epidemiological evidence points in the direction of a pathogenesis involving the immune system"

    snippet: "NT1 is a rare, life-long sleep disorder arising as a consequence of the extensive destruction of orexin-producing hypothalamic neurons. The mechanisms involved in the destruction of orexin neurons are not yet elucidated but the association of narcolepsy with environmental triggers and genetic susceptibility (strong association with the HLA, TCRs and other immunologically-relevant loci) implicates an immuno-pathological process."
    explanation: Transcriptomic study confirms the immunological basis and T-cell involvement in narcolepsy pathogenesis.
