has_subtypes:
- name: Narcolepsy Type 1
  description: With cataplexy and orexin/hypocretin deficiency.
- name: Narcolepsy Type 2
  description: Without cataplexy, normal or near-normal orexin levels.
pathophysiology:
- name: Orexin/Hypocretin Deficiency
  description: >
    Loss of orexin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus leads to
    instability of sleep-wake states. Orexin normally promotes and stabilizes
    wakefulness. In Type 1 narcolepsy, >90% of orexin neurons are destroyed,
    likely through autoimmune mechanisms.

    snippet: "Narcolepsy with cataplexy is caused by hypocretin deficiency owing to destruction of most of the hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus."
    explanation: Landmark review establishes hypocretin neuron loss as the cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy.
- name: Autoimmune Destruction
  description: >
    Strong HLA-DQB1*06:02 association suggests autoimmune etiology. T-cell
    mediated destruction of hypocretin neurons is the leading hypothesis.
    Environmental triggers (infections, H1N1 vaccination) may initiate
    the autoimmune response in genetically susceptible individuals.

  - preferred_term: Autoimmune Response
    term:
      id: GO:0002460
      label: adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domains
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:25728441
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The hypothesis that a targeted immune-mediated or autoimmune attack causes the specific degeneration of hypocretin neurons arose mainly through the discovery of genetic associations, first with the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele and then with the T-cell receptor α locus."
    explanation: Genetic associations with HLA and TCR loci strongly support autoimmune etiology.
