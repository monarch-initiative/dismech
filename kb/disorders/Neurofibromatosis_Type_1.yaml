description: >-
  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome
  caused by germline pathogenic variants in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene encoding
  neurofibromin. It is characterized by cafe-au-lait macules, neurofibromas, Lisch
  nodules, skeletal abnormalities, and increased risk of malignancy including optic
  pathway gliomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). NF1 exemplifies
  the RASopathy spectrum, with neurofibromin functioning as a RAS-GAP that normally
  negatively regulates RAS-MAPK signaling.

pathophysiology:
- name: NF1 Tumor Suppressor Loss
  description: >-
    Germline heterozygous NF1 mutations result in haploinsufficiency for neurofibromin
    function. Somatic loss or mutation of the remaining wild-type allele (second hit)
    eliminates neurofibromin completely, resulting in loss of RAS negative regulation
    and driving tumorigenesis. This follows Knudson's two-hit hypothesis.

  description: >-
    Neurofibromin normally accelerates GTP hydrolysis on RAS proteins, promoting
    the inactive GDP-bound state. Loss of neurofibromin results in prolonged RAS-GTP
    accumulation and constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade, driving
    cell proliferation and survival.

  description: >-
    Neural crest-derived cells (Schwann cells, melanocytes) show particular
    dependence on RAS-MAPK signaling. Loss of neurofibromin drives uncontrolled
    proliferation of these cell types, resulting in neurofibromas (Schwann cell
    tumors) and hyperpigmented skin lesions (cafe-au-lait macules from melanocyte
    hyperproliferation).

- name: NF1 Genetic Testing
  notes: >-
    Comprehensive NF1 testing identifies germline pathogenic variants including
    point mutations, small insertions/deletions, large deletions/duplications,
    and deep intronic variants. Approximately 50% are de novo mutations. Mutation
    detection rate exceeds 95% with comprehensive testing including deletion/duplication
    analysis.
genetic:
- name: NF1
  association: Germline Loss-of-Function Mutations
  inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
  notes: >-
    NF1 (17q11.2) encodes neurofibromin, a large protein with RAS-GAP domain that
    negatively regulates RAS signaling. Germline mutations include truncating variants,
    missense mutations in the GAP domain, splice site variants, and large deletions
    (5% of cases, associated with more severe phenotype). De novo mutation rate is
    approximately 50%. Penetrance is essentially complete but expressivity is highly
    variable, even within families.

      The phase 2 trial (SPRINT) of selumetinib in pNF resulted in at least 20%
      reduction in the size of pNF from baseline in 71% of patients and was associated

      (Koselugo) received FDA approval for children 2 years of age and older with
      inoperable, symptomatic pNF.
