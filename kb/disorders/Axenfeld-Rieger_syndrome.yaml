    snippet: Two homeobox mutations, R43W and R90C, resulted in severely reduced DNA-binding
      and transcriptional activation despite normal nuclear localization. L105V, located
      C-terminal to the homeodomain, resulted in normal localization, reporter gene
      transactivation, and protein half-life, but with an altered mobility shift pattern
      of protein-DNA complexes. N108T, also located C-terminal to the homeodomain,
      resulted in an altered mobility shift pattern and with slightly increased reporter
      transactivation and shortened protein half-life.

      frequency of 1.648e-05 by the Exome Aggregation Consortium, and has been reported
      in ClinVar once, by the laboratory that analyzed our patient's sample.

    snippet: We next studied two Rieger mutants. A threonine to proline mutation (T68P)
      in the second helix of the homeodomain retained DNA binding activity with the
      same apparent KD and only about a 2-fold reduction in the Bmax. However, this
      mutant did not transactivate reporter genes containing the bicoid site.
