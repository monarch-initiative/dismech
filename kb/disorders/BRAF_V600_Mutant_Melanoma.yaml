name: BRAF V600 Mutant Melanoma
description: >-
  BRAF V600-mutant melanoma is a molecular subtype of cutaneous melanoma characterized
  by activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene, most commonly V600E (substitution of
  valine for glutamic acid at codon 600), with V600K being the second most common variant.
  These mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF kinase and downstream
  MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, driving uncontrolled melanocyte proliferation. BRAF V600
  mutations occur in approximately 40-50% of cutaneous melanomas and are associated with
  intermittent sun exposure, younger patient age, and superficial spreading histology.
  This molecular subtype is paradigmatic for oncogene-targeted therapy, as the combination
  of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib plus trametinib) has transformed outcomes for
  patients with advanced disease.

pathophysiology:
- name: BRAF V600 Oncogenic Mutation
  description: >-
    BRAF V600 mutations, predominantly V600E and V600K, result in substitution of the
    valine residue in the activation loop of the BRAF kinase. This removes an autoinhibitory
    mechanism, causing constitutive kinase activity independent of upstream RAS signaling.
    The mutant BRAF signals as a monomer, unlike wild-type BRAF which requires dimerization
    for activation.

    snippet: Hotspot BRAF, hotspot NRAS, and NF1 loss-of-function mutations are found in approximately 50%, 25%, and 15%
      of cutaneous melanomas, respectively.
    explanation: This abstract reports frequent hotspot BRAF mutations in cutaneous melanoma, supporting the relevance 
      of BRAF-driven melanoma.

  description: >-
    Mutant BRAF continuously phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2, which in turn activates
    ERK1/2. This constitutive MAPK signaling drives expression of genes promoting cell
    cycle progression, survival, and proliferation. The pathway operates independently
    of growth factor stimulation.

notes: >-
  BRAF V600 mutations define a therapeutically actionable melanoma subtype. Resistance
  to BRAF/MEK inhibitors eventually develops in most patients through reactivation of
  MAPK signaling (MEK mutations, BRAF amplification) or activation of bypass pathways
  (PI3K/AKT, RAF1). Combination strategies targeting multiple pathways or sequencing
  with immunotherapy are areas of active research.
