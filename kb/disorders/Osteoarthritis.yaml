    Progressive loss of articular cartilage due to imbalance between
    catabolic and anabolic processes. Matrix metalloproteinases and
    aggrecanases degrade cartilage components.

    snippet: "In this review, we first summarize the epidemiology of OA, including its prevalence, incidence and burdens, and OA risk factors. We then focus on the roles and regulation of the pathological signaling pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB, focal adhesion, HIFs, TGFβ/ΒΜP and FGF signaling pathways, and key regulators AMPK, mTOR, and RUNX2 in the onset and development of OA. In addition, the roles of factors associated with OA, including MMPs, ADAMTS/ADAMs, and PRG4, are discussed in detail."
    explanation: "This review confirms that MMPs and ADAMTS enzymes are key factors in OA pathogenesis, supporting the role of matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanases in cartilage degradation."

    snippet: "The aggregation of GSDMD-NT proteins stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators, such as Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-18 (IL-18), and Matrix Metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), ultimately leading to cellular lysis."
    explanation: "MMP13 is specifically identified as a catabolic enzyme released during pyroptosis in OA, directly supporting the role of matrix metalloproteinases in cartilage component degradation."
- name: Subchondral Bone Changes

    Bone remodeling with subchondral sclerosis, cyst formation, and
    osteophyte development at joint margins. Bone changes may precede
    and contribute to cartilage damage.

    snippet: "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disorder that leads to disability and affects more than 500 million population worldwide. OA was believed to be caused by the wearing and tearing of articular cartilage, but it is now more commonly referred to as a chronic whole-joint disorder that is initiated with biochemical and cellular alterations in the synovial joint tissues, which leads to the histological and structural changes of the joint and ends up with the whole tissue dysfunction."
    explanation: "This review confirms the modern understanding of OA as a whole-joint disorder involving structural changes across all joint tissues, including subchondral bone, rather than just cartilage wear."
- name: Synovial Inflammation

    pain and cartilage destruction through inflammatory mediator release.

    snippet: "Pyroptosis is a complex process that involves three pathways culminating in the assembly of Gasdermin-D (GSDMD)-N-terminal (GSDMD-NT) into pores through aggregation on the plasma membrane. The aggregation of GSDMD-NT proteins stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators, such as Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-18 (IL-18), and Matrix Metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), ultimately leading to cellular lysis."
    explanation: "This evidence demonstrates the specific mechanism by which synovial cells release inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-18) through pyroptosis, directly supporting the description of inflammatory mediator release in synovitis."

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The pyroptosis process in specific cells, including synovial macrophages, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), chondrocytes, and subchondral osteoblasts, contributs factor to the development of OA."
    explanation: "This confirms that both synovial macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes undergo pyroptosis in OA, supporting the role of macrophage infiltration and synoviocyte dysfunction in disease pathogenesis."

    explanation: "The NF-κB signaling pathway mentioned here is a key regulator of inflammatory responses, supporting the inflammatory nature of synovial pathology in OA."
