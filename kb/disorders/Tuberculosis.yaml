description: Tuberculosis is a contagious bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis that primarily affects the lungs but can involve any organ. It spreads
  through airborne transmission and can exist in latent or active forms, with the
  active form causing characteristic symptoms including chronic cough, fever, night
  sweats, and weight loss.

treatments:
- name: Isoniazid
  description: First-line antibiotic for TB treatment.
  notes: It's important to note that resistance to isoniazid can develop through mutations
    in the katG gene, which reduces the activation of the drug, or in the inhA gene,
    which decreases the binding affinity of the activated drug to the InhA enzyme.
    To minimize the risk of resistance, isoniazid is typically used in combination
    with other antitubercular drugs, such as rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.
  mechanism:
  - name: Prodrug Activation
    description: Isoniazid is a prodrug that requires activation by the bacterial
      enzyme catalase-peroxidase (KatG). KatG couples the isonicotinic acyl with NADH
      to form an isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex.
  - name: Inhibition of InhA
    description: The activated form of isoniazid binds to and inhibits the enoyl-acyl
      carrier protein reductase (InhA), an enzyme involved in the fatty acid synthase
      II (FAS-II) pathway. This pathway is essential for the synthesis of mycolic
      acids.
  - name: Depletion of mycolic acids
    description: By inhibiting InhA, isoniazid prevents the synthesis of mycolic acids,
      which are long-chain fatty acids that make up a significant portion of the mycobacterial
      cell wall. Mycolic acids provide structural integrity and help the bacteria
      resist the host's immune response.
  - name: Cell wall disruption
    description: The depletion of mycolic acids leads to the weakening and disruption
      of the bacterial cell wall. This makes the bacteria more susceptible to the
      host's immune defenses and other antibiotics.
  - name: Reactive oxygen species
    description: In addition to inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis, the isoniazid-NAD
      adduct can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO)
      within the bacteria. These reactive species can cause damage to various bacterial
      components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, contributing to the bactericidal
      effect.

    explanation: This source supports the statement mentioning that a regimen of isoniazid
      and rifapentine is used for latent TB infection.

    snippet: The treatment of choice for LTBI is isoniazid for nine months.
    explanation: This source supports the use of isoniazid for the prevention of latent
      tuberculosis infection (LTBI).

    snippet: The World Health Organization recommends the use of isoniazid (INH) alone
      or in combination with rifapentine to treat latent tuberculosis infections.
    explanation: This supports the statement by specifying that WHO recommends isoniazid
      and rifapentine for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infections.

  description: Adjunctive strategies to enhance autophagy, modulate inflammasome activity, or reprogram macrophage lipid metabolism alongside standard antibiotics.
  notes: Emerging therapeutic approaches include autophagy inducers, anti-inflammatory agents targeting excessive NET formation or inflammasome activation, and lipid metabolism modulators to limit foamy macrophage formation and bacterial persistence.

  description: Open-label randomized prophylaxis study comparing delamanid versus isoniazid for preventing active tuberculosis among high-risk household contacts of adults with multidrug-resistant TB over 96 weeks of follow-up.
  evidence:
  - reference: clinicaltrials:NCT03568383
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of 26 weeks of delamanid (DLM) versus 26 weeks of isoniazid (INH) for preventing confirmed or probable active tuberculosis (TB) during 96 weeks of follow-up among high-risk household contacts (HHCs) of adults with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (index cases)."
    explanation: This trial evaluates delamanid as preventive therapy for household contacts of MDR-TB patients, directly relevant to tuberculosis control strategies.
notes: TB is a significant global health issue, particularly in low-income and developing
  countries.
