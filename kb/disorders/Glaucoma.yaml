- name: Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma
  description: Most common form, gradual onset with open drainage angle.
- name: Angle-Closure Glaucoma
  description: Blocked drainage angle, can be acute or chronic.
- name: Normal-Tension Glaucoma

pathophysiology:
- name: Elevated Intraocular Pressure
  description: >
    Impaired aqueous humor drainage through trabecular meshwork
    leads to increased IOP in most cases. Elevated pressure damages

    snippet: "Myocilin gene is expressed clearly in the trabecular meshwork cells of both glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes."
    explanation: Confirms MYOC expression in trabecular meshwork cells, but expression alone only indirectly supports dysfunction.
  - reference: PMID:37217093
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The prevailing pathogenic mechanism involves a gain of toxic function whereby mutant myocilin aggregates intracellularly instead of being secreted, which causes cell stress and an early timeline for TM cell death, elevated intraocular pressure, and subsequent glaucoma-associated retinal degeneration."
    explanation: Describes how mutant myocilin causes trabecular meshwork cell death through intracellular aggregation, directly linking MYOC mutations to trabecular dysfunction and elevated IOP.
