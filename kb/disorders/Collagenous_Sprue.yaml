  - name: Mucosal immune activation with intraepithelial lymphocytosis
    description: >
      Collagenous sprue is initiated by mucosal immune activation characterized by increased intraepithelial
      lymphocytes (IELs), particularly CD8+ T cells, and lamina propria inflammation with plasma cells and eosinophils.
      IL-15 and TNF-α signaling drive this T cell-mediated immune response, leading to epithelial cell apoptosis,
      crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy. This immune activation is not associated with celiac serology despite
      overlapping histologic features with celiac disease.

  - name: Epithelial barrier dysfunction and tight junction disruption
    description: >
      Immune-mediated epithelial damage impairs the intestinal epithelial barrier through disruption of tight junction proteins,
      particularly zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1/TJP1). Loss of barrier function allows increased paracellular transport and bacterial
      antigen exposure, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle. Crypt epithelial apoptosis and reduced junctional integrity compromise
      the epithelial seal, contributing to persistent diarrhea and protein-losing enteropathy.

    description: >
      Excessive collagen accumulation beneath the intestinal epithelium is the pathologic hallmark of collagenous sprue, defined by
      a thickened subepithelial collagen band >10 micrometers (normal 5-7 μm). This results from TGF-β–driven myofibroblast
      activation and differentiation from fibroblasts, with increased expression of collagen type I (COL1A1) and upregulation of
      tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP1). Simultaneously, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP1, MMP9) activity is reduced,
      creating an imbalance favoring ECM accumulation. The collagen band may entrap capillaries and stromal cells, disrupting
      villous architecture and nutrient absorption.

      Celiac disease presents with similar clinical manifestations including diarrhea, weight loss, and villous atrophy.
      However, it is distinguished by positive tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and endomysial antibodies, and typically
      responds well to a gluten-free diet. In contrast, collagenous sprue patients lack celiac serology and respond poorly
      to gluten-free diet alone.
    distinguishing_features:
      - Positive tTG and endomysial antibodies (seronegative in collagenous sprue)
      - Responds to gluten-free diet (collagenous sprue is often refractory)
      - Absence of thick subepithelial collagen band on biopsy
      - Lymphocytic infiltration pattern differs from collagenous sprue

    description: >
      Pulmonary hemosiderosis involves recurrent pulmonary bleeding with hemosiderin accumulation in lungs. While collagenous
      sprue can have pulmonary manifestations through shared immune mechanisms, isolated pulmonary hemosiderosis is
      characterized by lung involvement without the characteristic small bowel pathology and gastrointestinal symptoms of
      collagenous sprue.
    distinguishing_features:
      - Primarily pulmonary disease without significant gastrointestinal involvement
      - Hemosiderin-laden macrophages in BAL but not in intestinal biopsies
      - No villous atrophy or subepithelial collagen band in small intestine
      - Absence of chronic diarrhea and malabsorption

    description: >
      Microscopic colitis includes both lymphocytic and collagenous colitis subtypes, presenting with chronic watery diarrhea
      and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. Collagenous colitis can affect the small intestine and present as collagenous
      sprue, but the histologic patterns and clinical context help differentiate them. Collagenous sprue has more pronounced
      villous atrophy and is often associated with celiac-like presentations.
    distinguishing_features:
      - Collagenous colitis is primarily colonic; small bowel involvement as sprue is uncommon
      - Collagenous sprue typically has more severe villous atrophy
      - Microscopic colitis often responds to antidiarrheals and mesalamine

        id: MONDO:0018353
        label: refractory celiac disease
    description: >
      Refractory celiac disease (RCD) occurs in patients with confirmed celiac disease who fail to respond clinically and/or
      histologically to a gluten-free diet. While both collagenous sprue and RCD can be resistant to gluten-free diet,
      RCD patients have positive celiac serology and documented prior response to gluten-free diet initially, distinguishing
      them from collagenous sprue which is seronegative.
    distinguishing_features:
      - Positive celiac serology despite gluten-free diet (negative in collagenous sprue)
      - History of initial response to gluten-free diet followed by relapse or persistence
      - Absence of thick subepithelial collagen band
      - Often associated with intraepithelial lymphocytosis with aberrant T cell populations

        snippet: "The clinical course of celiac disease may be complicated by the development of additional conditions such as microscopic colitis, refractory celiac disease or collagenous sprue"
        explanation: Literature documents that refractory celiac disease and collagenous sprue are distinct but related complications of celiac disease, requiring differential diagnosis
      - reference: PMID:19855376

        snippet: "Seventeen (89%) had celiac disease and two had unclassified sprue; 9 of 17 (53%) celiac disease patients had refractory disease"
        explanation: Over half of collagenous sprue cases in celiac patients develop refractory disease, highlighting the need to differentiate between refractory celiac disease and collagenous complications
