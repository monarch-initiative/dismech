description: 'Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of mitochondrial energy
  metabolism caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in ETFA, ETFB, or ETFDH. These genes encode the electron transfer flavoprotein
  (ETF) system that shuttles electrons from multiple FAD-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to the mitochondrial ubiquinone
  (coenzyme Q) pool. Defective ETF/ETFDH-mediated electron transfer produces a functional block in mitochondrial fatty acid
  beta-oxidation and amino acid catabolism, resulting in characteristic acylcarnitine and organic acid accumulations. Three
  clinical forms are recognized: neonatal onset with congenital anomalies (type I), neonatal onset without anomalies (type
  II), and a milder late-onset form (type III) that is frequently riboflavin responsive. Incidence is approximately 1 in 200,000
  live births globally.

    acid catabolism, and choline oxidation, causing accumulation of multiple metabolic intermediates and energy deficit.

prevalence:
- notes: Approximately 1 in 200,000 live births globally. Late-onset MADD is the most common lipid storage myopathy, with
    a male predominance of approximately 58% in late-onset cases.
progression:
- notes: Disease course varies markedly by subtype. Neonatal forms (types I/II) often have high mortality with severe metabolic
    acidosis, multiorgan failure, and death in early infancy. Late-onset MADD (type III) is typically progressive with episodic
    decompensation, proximal weakness, exercise intolerance, and lipid storage myopathy, but responds dramatically to riboflavin
    in most cases.
notes: 'MADD exhibits remarkable genotype-phenotype correlation. ETFDH mutations predominate in late-onset riboflavin-responsive
  disease and are enriched in East Asian populations with the c.250G>A hotspot variant. ETFA and ETFB mutations tend to cause
  more severe neonatal forms. Recent advances include the discovery of an ETFDH-CIII-COQ2 metabolon (Nature Metabolism, 2024)
  expanding the understanding of MADD beyond a simple substrate oxidation block to a disorder of mitochondrial redox organization.
  The association of sertraline with acquired MADD (Annals of Neurology, 2024) represents an important pharmacovigilance finding.
