name: Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type V
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Osteogenesis imperfecta type V is a distinct form of OI caused by a specific
  heterozygous mutation in IFITM5 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5),
  not by collagen gene mutations. It is characterized by moderate severity,
  hyperplastic callus formation after fractures, calcification of the interosseous
  membrane of the forearm causing limitation of pronation/supination, and a
  distinctive mesh-like (reticular) lamellation pattern on bone histology.
  Scleral hue is normal and dentinogenesis imperfecta is absent.

inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
    description: >
      Autosomal dominant inheritance. A single recurrent mutation in IFITM5
      (c.-14C>T in the 5'UTR) accounts for all cases, creating a new upstream
      start codon that adds 5 amino acids to the protein.
pathophysiology:
  - name: IFITM5 Gain-of-Function
    description: >
      The c.-14C>T mutation creates an upstream start codon, producing an
      IFITM5 protein with 5 additional N-terminal amino acids. This altered
      protein disrupts normal bone mineralization and matrix organization,
      leading to the characteristic histological and clinical features. IFITM5
      (BRIL) is an osteoblast-specific protein involved in mineralization.

        snippet: >-
          Transfection of wild-type and mutant IFITM5 constructs revealed that the
          mutation added five amino acids (Met-Ala-Leu-Glu-Pro) to the N terminus of
          IFITM5. Given that IFITM5 expression and protein localization is restricted
          to the skeletal tissue and IFITM5 involvement in bone formation, we conclude
          that this recurrent mutation would have a specific effect on IFITM5 function.
        explanation: >-
          Demonstrates the mutation produces an extended N-terminal protein and
          establishes IFITM5 as a bone-specific protein involved in bone formation.
genetic:
  - name: IFITM5 c.-14C>T Mutation
    association: Causative
    notes: >
      A single recurrent mutation (c.-14C>T) in the 5'UTR of IFITM5 causes all
      cases of OI type V. This creates an upstream AUG start codon, resulting
      in an extended protein with 5 additional N-terminal amino acids (MALEP).
      This is a gain-of-function mechanism distinct from the collagen defects
      in classical OI.

          Using linkage analysis in a four-generation family and whole-exome sequencing,
          we identified a heterozygous mutation of c.-14C>T in the 5'-untranslated region
          of a gene encoding interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5). It
          completely cosegregated with the disease in three families and occurred de novo
          in five simplex individuals.
