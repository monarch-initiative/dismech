description: 'Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT-II) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of mitochondrial
  long-chain fatty acid oxidation caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in CPT2. CPT-II is an inner mitochondrial membrane
  enzyme that reconverts long-chain acylcarnitines back to long-chain acyl-CoA for entry into beta-oxidation, forming the
  final step of the carnitine shuttle. Three clinical phenotypes are recognized: a lethal neonatal form, a severe infantile
  hepatocardiomuscular form, and the most common adult myopathic form characterized by recurrent exercise- or illness-triggered
  myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria. A literature review identified 245 documented CPT2 cases distributed as 21 lethal
  neonatal, 32 severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular, and 192 myopathic.

parents:
- Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorder
- Inborn Error of Metabolism
prevalence:
- notes: Rare; one narrative review cites approximately 1-9 per 100,000. A 2024 literature review identified 245 published
    cases (21 neonatal lethal, 32 severe infantile, 192 myopathic). The myopathic form is the most common inherited disorder
    of muscle fatty acid metabolism.
progression:
- notes: In the myopathic form, metabolic crises are episodic and triggered by prolonged exercise, fasting, fever, or cold
    exposure. Between crises patients are typically asymptomatic. Severe neonatal and infantile forms follow a progressive
    multiorgan decline. Repeated rhabdomyolysis episodes can lead to cumulative renal damage.
pathophysiology:
- name: Impaired mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation
  description: 'Loss of CPT-II function impairs mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, resulting in accumulation
    of long-chain acylcarnitines and disruption of energy homeostasis, especially during fasting, illness, fever, or prolonged
    exercise when reliance on fatty acid oxidation increases.

  description: 'The common myopathic variant p.Ser113Leu produces an enzyme with near-normal baseline activity but marked
    thermolability at elevated temperatures (40-45 degrees C) and abnormal sensitivity to inhibition by malonyl-CoA. This
    provides a mechanistic rationale for fever- and exertion-triggered metabolic crises, as the mutant enzyme loses activity
    precisely when fatty acid oxidation demand is greatest.

- name: LCAC-mediated calcium dyshomeostasis in skeletal muscle
  description: 'In CPT2-deficient muscle, accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines (LCACs), particularly palmitoyl-carnitine,
    directly inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, disrupts excitation-contraction coupling structures, and increases
    mitochondrial calcium stress and permeability transition pore susceptibility. This leads to contractile dysfunction and
    myofiber injury beyond simple energy failure.

notes: 'CPT II deficiency is notable for its clinical heterogeneity arising from a single gene (CPT2) without tissue-specific
  isoforms. The most common S113L variant is thermolabile, explaining why the myopathic form presents with crisis-driven symptoms
  during fever or exercise. A key diagnostic pitfall is that acylcarnitine profiles may be completely normal between episodes,
  necessitating sampling during metabolic stress or definitive genetic testing. Recent mechanistic advances (2024) demonstrate
  that muscle damage involves LCAC-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake inhibition beyond simple energy failure,
  suggesting potential future therapeutic targets.
