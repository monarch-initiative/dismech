description: >-
  Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome
  caused by germline pathogenic variants in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. It is
  characterized by a dramatically increased lifetime risk of multiple cancers, including
  soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical
  carcinoma, and leukemias. LFS exemplifies the two-hit hypothesis: patients inherit
  one mutant TP53 allele and somatic loss of the remaining wild-type allele initiates
  tumorigenesis. The syndrome demonstrates remarkable phenotypic variability, with
  some carriers developing multiple primary cancers while others remain cancer-free.

has_subtypes:
- name: Classic Li-Fraumeni Syndrome
  description: >-
    Defined by classic clinical criteria: proband with sarcoma before age 45,
    first-degree relative with cancer before 45, and another first- or second-degree
    relative with cancer before 45 or sarcoma at any age.
- name: Li-Fraumeni-Like Syndrome
  description: >-
    Families meeting relaxed criteria (Birch or Eeles) who have germline TP53
    mutations but do not fulfill classic LFS criteria. May have later onset
    or fewer affected family members.
pathophysiology:
- name: TP53 Tumor Suppressor Loss
  description: >-
    Germline heterozygous TP53 mutations result in haploinsufficiency for p53
    function. Somatic loss or inactivation of the remaining wild-type allele
    (second hit) eliminates p53 tumor suppressor activity, removing a critical
    checkpoint against malignant transformation.

    description: p53 loss prevents elimination of damaged cells
- name: Loss of DNA Damage Response
  description: >-
    p53 is a master regulator of the DNA damage response. Upon detecting DNA
    damage, p53 activates transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest,
    DNA repair, and apoptosis. Loss of p53 function eliminates this critical
    surveillance mechanism.

    description: Unchecked DNA damage leads to mutation accumulation
- name: Loss of Cell Cycle Checkpoint Control
  description: >-
    p53 induces G1 arrest in response to DNA damage by activating p21 (CDKN1A)
    transcription, which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases. Without p53, cells
    with damaged DNA continue through the cell cycle, replicating mutations.

    description: Damaged cells replicate, accumulating mutations
- name: Impaired Apoptosis
  description: >-
    p53 promotes apoptosis through transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic
    genes (BAX, PUMA, NOXA) and repression of anti-apoptotic BCL2. Loss of p53
    allows damaged and potentially transformed cells to survive and proliferate.

    description: Damaged cells escape elimination and undergo malignant transformation
- name: Genomic Instability
  description: >-
    Loss of p53-mediated checkpoints and DNA repair coordination leads to
    progressive accumulation of genomic alterations including point mutations,
    chromosomal rearrangements, and aneuploidy. This genomic instability
    accelerates tumor development and drives cancer heterogeneity.

    The combination of impaired DNA damage response, loss of cell cycle checkpoints,

      observed in 30%, 27%, 26%, and 23% of the patients, respectively. In adults,

- name: TP53 Genetic Testing
  notes: >-
    Molecular testing of TP53 identifies germline pathogenic variants including
    missense mutations (especially in the DNA-binding domain), nonsense mutations,
    frameshift mutations, and splice site variants. Certain mutations (R175H,
    R248W, R273H) have dominant-negative effects.
genetic:
- name: TP53
  association: Germline Loss-of-Function Mutations
  inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
  notes: >-
    TP53 (17p13.1) encodes the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Germline pathogenic
    variants cause LFS with high but incomplete penetrance. Most mutations are
    missense variants in the DNA-binding domain (exons 5-8). Some mutations
    (R175H, R248Q, R248W, R273H, R273C) have dominant-negative effects beyond
    simple loss of function. The Brazilian founder mutation R337H has attenuated
    penetrance but high association with adrenocortical carcinoma.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26014290
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      The mean age of tumor onset was statistically different (P < .05) between
      carriers harboring dominant-negative missense mutations (21.3 years) and
      those with all types of loss of function mutations (28.5 years) or genomic
      rearrangements (35.8 years). Affected children, except those with ACC,
      harbored mostly dominant-negative missense mutations.
    explanation: >-
      Clinical gradient of germline TP53 mutations demonstrates that dominant-negative
      missense mutations cause earlier tumor onset (21.3 years) compared to loss-of-function
      mutations (28.5 years), supporting mutation-specific phenotype stratification.

      the panel recommends adoption of a modified version of the "Toronto protocol"
      that includes a combination of physical exams, blood tests, and imaging.
      The panel also recommends that further research be promoted to explore the
      feasibility and effectiveness of these risk-adapted surveillance and cancer
      prevention strategies.
    explanation: >-
      AACR expert panel consensus recommends the Toronto Protocol surveillance
      approach for all LFS patients as soon as diagnosis is established.
- name: Risk-Reducing Mastectomy

    Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy may be considered for women with LFS
    given the extremely high lifetime breast cancer risk (85-90%). Decision
    requires careful counseling about risks and benefits.

    increased risk of radiation-induced secondary malignancies. Alternative
    treatment modalities should be considered.
  notes: >-
    p53 is critical for radiation-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
    LFS patients are exquisitely sensitive to radiation-induced carcinogenesis.
