description: 'Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of mitochondrial
  long-chain fatty acid oxidation caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC25A20. CACT is a mitochondrial inner membrane
  transporter that facilitates the exchange of long-chain acylcarnitines for free carnitine across the inner mitochondrial
  membrane, a critical step in the carnitine shuttle required for long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation. Loss of CACT function
  leads to impaired mitochondrial energy production during fasting or catabolic stress, accumulation of toxic long-chain acylcarnitines,
  and secondary free carnitine depletion. The severe neonatal-onset form presents within the first days of life with hypoketotic
  hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, hepatic dysfunction, and high mortality (~65%) predominantly
  from cardiac causes. An attenuated form with later onset and milder symptoms allows better developmental outcomes with appropriate
  treatment.

    long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation. This leads to inadequate ATP generation during fasting, birth, or illness, and impaired
    ketogenesis, shifting energy reliance to glucose until glycogen stores are depleted.

    explanation: Review confirms the central importance of preventing lipolysis and managing catabolic states.
notes: 'Outcomes correlate strongly with cardiac involvement and residual long-chain fatty acid oxidation capacity rather
  than a single enzyme activity metric. The acylcarnitine profile of CACT deficiency is indistinguishable from CPT II deficiency,
  requiring SLC25A20 sequencing and/or functional assays for definitive diagnosis. CACT deficiency often presents before routine
  newborn screening collection timing (e.g., 72-hour DBS sampling), creating a structural limitation for prevention of the
  earliest crises. Agents and circumstances to avoid include prolonged fasting, catabolic illness, prolonged strenuous physical
  activity, and anesthetics containing high levels of long-chain fatty acids (e.g., propofol).
