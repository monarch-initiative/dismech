description: >-
  Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory immune-mediated arthropathy
  associated with psoriasis.
pathophysiology:
- name: Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Arthritis
  description: >-
    Genetic predisposition and environmental triggers activate innate and
    adaptive immune pathways, leading to persistent musculoskeletal inflammation.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:36902329
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "The pathogenesis of PsA is complex and multifaceted, with an interplay of genetic predisposition, triggering environmental factors, and activation of the innate and adaptive immune system, although autoinflammation has also been implicated."
    explanation: The review summarizes immune-mediated pathogenesis with genetic and environmental drivers.
- name: Cytokine Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    Dysregulated cytokine signaling, particularly IL-23/IL-17 and TNF pathways,
    sustains inflammatory responses in affected tissues.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: cytokine-mediated signaling pathway
    modifier: INCREASED
    term:
      id: GO:0019221
      label: cytokine-mediated signaling pathway
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:36902329
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Research has identified several immune-inflammatory pathways defined by cytokines (IL-23/IL-17, TNF), leading to the development of efficacious therapeutic targets."
    explanation: The abstract highlights cytokine pathways as central inflammatory drivers in PsA.
- name: Enthesitis as a Primary Event
  description: >-
    Enthesitis is a key manifestation of psoriatic arthritis and may represent
    an early event in disease development with activation of IL-17 and TNF
    pathways.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:32159793
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Enthesitis is a key manifestation of PsA and current knowledge supports the concept that it may be among the primary events in the development of this disease, as well as other forms of SpA."
    explanation: The abstract describes enthesitis as a key manifestation and potential primary event in PsA.
  - reference: PMID:32159793
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Activation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-17 and TNF-α as well as the influx of innate immune cells are key events in the development of enthesitis in PsA."
    explanation: The abstract notes IL-17 and TNF-α as key mediators of PsA enthesitis.
