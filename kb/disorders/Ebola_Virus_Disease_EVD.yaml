    snippet: Key recommendations include administration of oral and, as necessary,
      intravenous hydration; systematic monitoring of vital signs and volume status;
      availability of key biochemical testing; adequate staffing ratios; and availability
      of analgesics, including opioids, for pain relief.
    explanation: The evidence-based guidelines for supportive care of patients with
      EVD include recommendations that align with rehydration and symptomatic treatments
      for managing fever, bleeding, and pain.
