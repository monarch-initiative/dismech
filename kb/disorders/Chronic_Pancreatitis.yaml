    Repeated episodes of pancreatic inflammation cause progressive
    acinar cell damage. Alcohol, smoking, and genetic factors are
    major causes. Premature trypsin activation injures cells.

    snippet: "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a devastating disease, and patient outcomes have not improved in decades."
    explanation: >
      This paper discusses pancreatic stellate cells and their role in
      pancreatic pathology. While focused on cancer, the stellate cell
      activation mechanisms are shared with chronic pancreatitis and
      support the inflammatory injury cascade.
- name: Pancreatic Fibrosis
  description: >
    Activated pancreatic stellate cells produce excessive collagen,
    leading to progressive fibrosis. Fibrosis replaces functional
    parenchyma and causes ductal strictures.

    explanation: >
      Pancreatic stellate cells are the key drivers of fibrosis in
      chronic pancreatitis. This review discusses how activated stellate
      cells produce the stromal matrix that characterizes pancreatic
      fibrosis, a central feature of chronic pancreatitis progression.
- name: Exocrine Insufficiency
  description: >
    Loss of acinar cell mass leads to insufficient digestive enzyme
    production. Steatorrhea and malabsorption occur when >90% of
    exocrine function is lost.
