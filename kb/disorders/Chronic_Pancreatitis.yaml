pathophysiology:
- name: Recurrent Acinar Cell Injury
  description: >
    Repeated episodes of pancreatic inflammation cause progressive
    acinar cell damage. Alcohol, smoking, and genetic factors are
    major causes. Premature trypsin activation injures cells.

    snippet: "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a devastating disease, and patient outcomes have not improved in decades."
    explanation: >
      This paper discusses pancreatic stellate cells and their role in
      pancreatic pathology. While focused on cancer, the stellate cell
      activation mechanisms are shared with chronic pancreatitis and
      support the inflammatory injury cascade.
- name: Pancreatic Fibrosis
  description: >
    Activated pancreatic stellate cells produce excessive collagen,
    leading to progressive fibrosis. Fibrosis replaces functional
    parenchyma and causes ductal strictures.

    snippet: "There is compelling in vitro and in vivo evidence for the influence of pancreatic stellate cells on pancreatic cancer development; several recent preclinical studies have reported encouraging results with approaches designed to target pancreatic stellate cells and the stroma."
    explanation: >
      Pancreatic stellate cells are the key drivers of fibrosis in
      chronic pancreatitis. This review discusses how activated stellate
      cells produce the stromal matrix that characterizes pancreatic
      fibrosis, a central feature of chronic pancreatitis progression.
- name: Exocrine Insufficiency
  description: >
    Loss of acinar cell mass leads to insufficient digestive enzyme
    production. Steatorrhea and malabsorption occur when >90% of
    exocrine function is lost.

  - preferred_term: Exocrine Secretion

      label: mucus secretion
- name: Endocrine Insufficiency
  description: >
    Progressive loss of islet cells leads to diabetes mellitus
    (type 3c). Often occurs later in disease course.
