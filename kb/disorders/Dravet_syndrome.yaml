name: Dravet_syndrome
category: Genetic
parents:
- Epileptic Encephalopathy
- Neurologic Disorder
prevalence:
- population: Global
  percentage: Rare
progression:
- phase: Onset

pathophysiology:
- name: SCN1A Gene Mutation
  description: Mutations in the SCN1A gene cause dysfunction in sodium channels, leading
    to abnormal neuronal excitability.

  notes: Include prolonged febrile seizures and various types of epilepsy as the condition
    progresses.

  notes: Management of fever is crucial to minimize seizure risk.
- name: Excessive Heat and Overexertion
  effect: Exacerbates Symptoms
  notes: Can trigger or worsen seizures.
notes: Early diagnosis and a comprehensive treatment plan are essential to managing
  Dravet syndrome and improving quality of life.
