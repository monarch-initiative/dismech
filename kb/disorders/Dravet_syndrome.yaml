name: Dravet_syndrome
description: Dravet syndrome is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy
  characterized by treatment-resistant seizures beginning in infancy, developmental
  regression, and cognitive impairment. It is primarily caused by de novo loss-of-function
  mutations in SCN1A, encoding the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel.
