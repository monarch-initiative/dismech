name: Dravet_syndrome
description: Dravet syndrome is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy
  characterized by treatment-resistant seizures beginning in infancy, developmental
  regression, and cognitive impairment. It is primarily caused by de novo loss-of-function
  mutations in SCN1A, encoding the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel.
category: Genetic
parents:
- Epileptic Encephalopathy
- Neurologic Disorder
prevalence:
- population: Global
  percentage: Rare
progression:
- phase: Onset
  age_range: Infancy
pathophysiology:
- name: SCN1A Gene Mutation
  description: Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A cause reduced Nav1.1
    sodium channel function, primarily affecting GABAergic inhibitory interneurons.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:21463282
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Loss-of-function in Na(v) 1.1 channels results in severely impaired sodium
      current and action potential firing in hippocampal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic
      interneurons without detectable changes in excitatory pyramidal neurons.
- name: Neuronal Hyperexcitability
  description: Reduced inhibitory interneuron function leads to excitatory-inhibitory
    imbalance and network hyperexcitability.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:21463282
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: The resulting imbalance between excitation and inhibition likely contributes
      to hyperexcitability and seizures.
