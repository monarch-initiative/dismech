notes: Bronchiectasis is characterized by a self-sustaining "vicious vortex" of mucociliary dysfunction, persistent infection with Proteobacteria-dominant dysbiosis (notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and chronic neutrophil-driven inflammation. Neutrophils release proteases (NE, PR3, CatG) and form NETs that degrade extracellular matrix, impair ciliary function, and damage epithelial barriers. Inflammasome activation with airway IL-1beta is associated with severe disease, mucus hyperconcentration, and epithelial dysfunction. The disease leads to irreversible bronchial dilation and progressive airflow limitation.
