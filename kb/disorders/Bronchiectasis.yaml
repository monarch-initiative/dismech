name: Bronchiectasis
category: Respiratory Disease
parents:
- Chronic Lung Disease
- Inflammatory Lung Disease
prevalence:
- population: Adults
  percentage: Unknown
- population: Children
  percentage: Unknown
progression:
- phase: Onset
  age_range: Childhood to Adulthood
pathophysiology:
- name: Chronic Infection and Inflammation
  description: Persistent microbial infections and inflammation damage airway walls,
    leading to dilation and thickening.
  downstream:
  - target: Airway Dilation
- name: Airway Dilation
  description: Destruction of elastin and cartilage in the bronchial walls causes
    irreversible dilation of bronchi.
  downstream:
  - target: Impaired Mucociliary Clearance
- name: Impaired Mucociliary Clearance
  description: Damage and dilation of airways hinder effective clearance of mucus,
    allowing for accumulation and further infection.
