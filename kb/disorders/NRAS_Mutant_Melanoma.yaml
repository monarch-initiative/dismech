description: >-
  NRAS-mutant melanoma is a molecular subtype of cutaneous melanoma characterized by
  activating mutations in the NRAS oncogene, occurring in approximately 15-25% of
  cutaneous melanomas. The most common mutations affect codon 61 (Q61R, Q61K, Q61L),
  with codons 12 and 13 affected less frequently. NRAS mutations result in constitutive
  GTP-bound active state and persistent activation of both MAPK and PI3K signaling
  pathways. NRAS-mutant melanomas are associated with chronic sun damage, older patient
  age, thicker primary tumors, and poorer prognosis compared to BRAF-mutant disease.
  Unlike BRAF-mutant melanoma, direct RAS inhibition has proven challenging, though
  MEK inhibitors show some activity and combination strategies are under investigation.

pathophysiology:
- name: NRAS Q61 Oncogenic Mutation
  description: >-
    NRAS mutations at codon 61 (Q61R, Q61K, Q61L) impair intrinsic GTPase activity
    and reduce sensitivity to GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), resulting in
    constitutively GTP-bound active NRAS. This locks the protein in its active
    conformation, continuously stimulating downstream effector pathways.

- name: Dual MAPK and PI3K Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    Unlike BRAF mutations that primarily activate MAPK signaling, oncogenic NRAS
    simultaneously activates both the RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway and the PI3K-AKT
    pathway. This dual pathway activation contributes to the aggressive biology
    and relative treatment resistance of NRAS-mutant melanoma.

    PI3K-AKT pathway activation downstream of NRAS promotes melanoma cell survival
    through phosphorylation and inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins, activation

    Most common NRAS mutation in melanoma, substituting glutamine with arginine
    at codon 61. Impairs GTPase activity and GAP sensitivity, resulting in
    constitutively active NRAS.

  association: Somatic Oncogenic Mutation
  notes: >-
    Common NRAS mutation substituting glutamine with lysine at codon 61. Functionally
    equivalent to Q61R with similar downstream pathway activation.

    NRAS mutation substituting glutamine with leucine at codon 61. Results in
    constitutive pathway activation similar to other Q61 mutations.
treatments:

  description: >-
    MEK inhibitors (binimetinib, trametinib) have demonstrated modest activity in
    NRAS-mutant melanoma. Response rates are lower than in BRAF-mutant disease
    (approximately 15-20%), but MEK inhibition represents one of the few targeted
    options for this molecular subtype.

notes: >-
  Direct RAS inhibition has historically been considered undruggable due to high
  picomolar affinity for GTP and lack of suitable drug-binding pockets. However,
  recent advances including RAS(ON) inhibitors and covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors
  have renewed interest in direct RAS targeting. NRAS-mutant melanoma patients
  generally have poorer outcomes than BRAF-mutant disease and lack a standard
  targeted therapy option, making immunotherapy the mainstay of treatment.
