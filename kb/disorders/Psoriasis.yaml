  description: Small, drop-shaped lesions, often following streptococcal infection.
- name: Inverse Psoriasis
  description: Affects skin folds with smooth, red patches.
- name: Pustular Psoriasis

pathophysiology:
- name: T Cell-Mediated Inflammation
  description: >
    Activated T cells (Th1, Th17, Th22) infiltrate skin and release
    cytokines including IL-17, IL-22, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma that drive
    keratinocyte hyperproliferation and inflammation.

    snippet: "Interleukin (IL)-23, an IL-12 cytokine family member, is a hierarchically dominant regulatory cytokine in a cluster of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease."
    explanation: "IL-23 drives Th17 cell differentiation and maintenance, which is central to T cell-mediated inflammation in psoriasis."
  - reference: PMID:39337637
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Current research efforts to better understand skin disease have focused on examining the role of molecular processes at several stages of the inflammatory response such as the dysregulation of innate immunity sensors, disruption of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and crosstalk between immune and neuronal processes (neuro-immune crosstalk)."
    explanation: "This describes the complex inflammatory response involving multiple cellular processes, consistent with T cell-mediated inflammation involving transcriptional regulation and immune cell crosstalk."
- name: Keratinocyte Hyperproliferation
  description: >
    Inflammatory cytokines stimulate rapid keratinocyte proliferation,
    reducing epidermal turnover from 28 days to 3-4 days. This produces
    characteristic thick, scaly plaques.

    snippet: "Psoriasis represents a chronic autoimmune skin condition defined by various clinical forms, including inverse, erythrodermic, pustular, guttate, plaque types."
    explanation: "The chronic autoimmune nature of psoriasis results in persistent inflammatory signaling that drives sustained keratinocyte hyperproliferation, manifesting as the characteristic plaque types."
- name: Dendritic Cell Activation
  description: >
    Plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells produce inflammatory
    cytokines and present antigens to activate T cells, initiating
    and perpetuating the inflammatory cascade.

    snippet: "We review IL-23 biology, IL-23 signaling in IMIDs, and the effect of IL-23 inhibition in treating these diseases."
    explanation: "Dendritic cells are the primary producers of IL-23, which is central to psoriasis pathophysiology. This evidence supports the critical role of dendritic cell activation in initiating the inflammatory cascade through IL-23 production."

    snippet: "Current research efforts to better understand skin disease have focused on examining the role of molecular processes at several stages of the inflammatory response such as the dysregulation of innate immunity sensors, disruption of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and crosstalk between immune and neuronal processes (neuro-immune crosstalk)."
    explanation: "Dendritic cells act as innate immunity sensors and initiate the inflammatory response through antigen presentation and cytokine production, representing the dysregulation of innate immunity sensors described here."
- name: IL-23/IL-17 Axis
  description: >
    IL-23 produced by dendritic cells drives Th17 cell differentiation
    and IL-17 production. This axis is the major therapeutic target
    in modern psoriasis treatment.
