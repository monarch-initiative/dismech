    label: fragile X syndrome
has_subtypes:
- name: Full Mutation
  description: More than 200 CGG repeats with methylation, full syndrome expression in males.
- name: Premutation Carrier
  description: 55-200 CGG repeats, risk for FXTAS (tremor-ataxia) and FXPOI in carriers.
pathophysiology:
- name: FMRP Deficiency
  description: >
    Expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeat in FMR1 gene 5' UTR beyond 200 repeats causes
    hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. This results in absence of fragile X
    mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein essential for synaptic plasticity.

  - preferred_term: Synaptic Plasticity
    term:

      label: regulation of synaptic plasticity
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:24346713
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Most FXS cases occur due to the expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5' un-translated region of FMR1, which leads to hypermethylation and in turn silences the expression of FMRP"
    explanation: Review confirms CGG repeat expansion leads to FMRP silencing in Fragile X syndrome.
- name: Abnormal Synaptic Development
  description: >
    FMRP normally suppresses translation of many synaptic proteins. Its absence leads to
    excessive protein synthesis at synapses, abnormal dendritic spine morphology (long, thin spines),
    and impaired synaptic maturation and pruning.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:24346713
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In the absence of FMRP, the basal protein translation is enhanced and not responsive to neuronal stimulation. The altered protein translation may contribute to functional abnormalities in certain aspects of synaptic plasticity"
    explanation: Review confirms FMRP absence leads to altered synaptic protein synthesis and plasticity.
  - reference: PMID:22483044
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "FMRP is an mRNA-binding protein that functions at many synapses to inhibit local translation stimulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 1 and 5."
    explanation: Review confirms FMRP normally inhibits synaptic protein translation.
