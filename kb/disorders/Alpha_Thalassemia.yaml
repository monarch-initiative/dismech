has_subtypes:
- name: Silent Carrier (One Alpha-Globin Gene Deleted)
  description: >
    Loss of one alpha-globin gene (-α/αα). Clinically silent with normal
    hematologic parameters or minimal microcytosis. Detected only by molecular
    testing.
- name: Alpha Thalassemia Trait (Two Alpha-Globin Genes Deleted)
  description: >
    Loss of two alpha-globin genes, either in cis (--/αα) or trans (-α/-α).
    Mild microcytic hypochromic anemia. The cis form (common in Southeast
    Asian populations) carries risk of hydrops fetalis in offspring.
- name: Hemoglobin H Disease (Three Alpha-Globin Genes Deleted)
  description: >
    Loss of three alpha-globin genes (--/-α). Moderate hemolytic anemia with
    HbH inclusions on brilliant cresyl blue staining. Phenotype ranges from
    mild to transfusion-dependent, particularly in non-deletional forms.
- name: Hemoglobin Bart Hydrops Fetalis Syndrome (Four Alpha-Globin Genes
    Deleted)
  description: >
    Loss of all four alpha-globin genes (--/--). Severe intrauterine anemia,
    hydrops fetalis, and usually death in the neonatal period without
    intrauterine intervention.

- population: Global carriers
  notes: >
    Alpha thalassemia is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions.

pathophysiology:
- name: Defective Alpha-Globin Synthesis
  description: >
    Deletions or point mutations in HBA1 and/or HBA2 genes reduce or abolish
    alpha-globin chain production. Large deletions are the most common cause,
    removing one or both alpha-globin genes on chromosome 16p13.3. Non-deletional
    mutations (point mutations, small insertions/deletions) tend to produce more
    severe phenotypes for the same number of affected alleles.

- name: Beta-Globin Chain Excess and Hemoglobin H Formation
  description: >
    In the absence of sufficient alpha-globin chains, excess beta-globin chains
    form unstable tetramers called hemoglobin H (beta4). HbH precipitates as
    inclusion bodies in mature red cells, causing membrane damage and premature
    destruction. In the most severe form (Hb Bart syndrome), excess gamma-globin
    chains form hemoglobin Bart (gamma4), which has extremely high oxygen
    affinity and cannot deliver oxygen to tissues.
