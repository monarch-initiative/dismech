transmission:
- name: Aedes mosquito transmission
  description: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus transmit dengue virus to humans.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:23817881
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: It is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquito.
    explanation: The abstract specifies Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus as vectors.
pathophysiology:
- name: Plasma leakage leading to shock in severe dengue
  description: Severe dengue involves plasma leakage that can progress to hypovolemic shock.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:32265181
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Plasma leakages is the main pathophysiological hallmark that distinguishes DHF from DF. Severe plasma leakage can result in hypovolemic shock.
    explanation: The review highlights plasma leakage and shock in severe dengue.
