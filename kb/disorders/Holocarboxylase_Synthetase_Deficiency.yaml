description: 'Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by biallelic
  pathogenic variants in the HLCS gene. HLCS catalyzes the covalent attachment of biotin to the four biotin-dependent carboxylases:
  pyruvate carboxylase (PC), propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC). Loss of HLCS activity produces multiple carboxylase deficiency, disrupting gluconeogenesis, amino acid catabolism,
  propionate metabolism, and fatty acid synthesis. Clinical manifestations include episodic or persistent metabolic acidosis,
  lactic acidosis, hyperammonemia, ketosis, seizures, skin rash, alopecia, and developmental delay. Onset is typically neonatal
  but late-onset forms occur. Pharmacologic biotin supplementation is the primary disease-modifying therapy, often producing
  dramatic biochemical and clinical improvement.

progression:
- notes: HLCS deficiency follows a progression from genetic defect through multi-enzyme deficiency to metabolic crisis. (1)
    Biallelic HLCS variants reduce holocarboxylase synthetase activity. (2) Impaired biotinylation of PC, PCC, MCC, and ACC
    produces multiple carboxylase deficiency. (3) Accumulation of organic acids and acylcarnitines causes metabolic acidosis,
    lactic acidosis, ketosis, and hyperammonemia. (4) Systemic decompensation produces neurologic injury (seizures, encephalopathy),
    dermatologic features (rash, alopecia), and respiratory distress. (5) Without treatment, progression to coma and death
    can occur. With prompt biotin therapy, 82% of patients in a large cohort developed normally. Onset is typically neonatal
    but very late-onset forms (11 years symptomatic, 23 years diagnosed) demonstrate phenotypic heterogeneity.
notes: 'Key clinical pearls: (1) HLCS deficiency is one of the treatable inborn errors of metabolism -- pharmacologic biotin
  often produces dramatic improvement within hours. (2) Deaths in the 28-patient Chinese cohort occurred during initial crises
  without timely biotin. (3) Genotype may predict biotin responsiveness: C-terminal biotin-binding domain variants (aa 448-701)
  tend to be more responsive than N-terminal variants (aa 159-314). (4) Biotin dosing typically ranges from 10-40 mg/day with
  tapering under biochemical monitoring. (5) Newborn screening via C5-OH is feasible but false negatives occur. (6) HLCS deficiency
  should be considered in any child or adult with unexplained metabolic acidosis, even beyond the neonatal period.
