has_subtypes:
- name: Severe Hemophilia A
  description: Factor VIII activity less than 1%, spontaneous bleeding episodes.

  description: Factor VIII activity 5-40%, bleeding with surgery or major trauma.
pathophysiology:
- name: Factor VIII Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in the F8 gene cause deficient or dysfunctional factor VIII protein.
    Factor VIII is a cofactor for factor IXa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway,
    essential for thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Blood Coagulation
    term:
      id: GO:0007596
      label: blood coagulation
- name: Impaired Thrombin Generation
  description: >
    Without functional factor VIII, the intrinsic tenase complex cannot form
    efficiently. This results in inadequate thrombin generation and unstable
    fibrin clot formation, leading to prolonged bleeding.

treatments:
- name: Factor VIII Replacement
  description: Recombinant or plasma-derived factor VIII concentrate for bleeding episodes and prophylaxis.
- name: Emicizumab
  description: Bispecific antibody mimicking factor VIII function, subcutaneous prophylaxis.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:30157389
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Emicizumab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that bridges activated factor IX and factor X to replace the function of missing activated factor VIII, thereby restoring hemostasis."
    explanation: Phase 3 HAVEN 3 trial demonstrates emicizumab mechanism and efficacy in hemophilia A without inhibitors.
- name: Desmopressin (DDAVP)
  description: Releases endogenous factor VIII, useful in mild hemophilia A.
- name: Antifibrinolytics
  description: Tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid as adjunctive therapy.
- name: Gene Therapy
  description: Emerging treatment using AAV vectors to deliver functional F8 gene.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35294811
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In patients with severe hemophilia A, valoctocogene roxaparvovec treatment provided endogenous factor VIII production and significantly reduced bleeding and factor VIII concentrate use relative to factor VIII prophylaxis."
    explanation: Phase 3 GENEr8-1 trial demonstrates AAV5-based gene therapy efficacy in severe hemophilia A.
