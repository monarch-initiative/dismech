name: Hemophilia A
description: >
  Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by deficiency or
  dysfunction of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). It is the most common severe inherited
  coagulation disorder, characterized by spontaneous and prolonged bleeding episodes,
  particularly into joints and muscles. Severity correlates with residual FVIII activity
  levels.

    episodes, frequent hemarthrosis, and risk of life-threatening hemorrhage.

  description: >
    FVIII activity 1-5% of normal. Bleeding occurs with minor trauma or surgery;
    occasional spontaneous bleeding.

  description: >
    FVIII activity 5-40% of normal. Bleeding typically occurs only with significant
    trauma or surgery.
prevalence:
- population: Global
  percentage: 0.01-0.02
  notes: Approximately 1 in 5,000 male births
inheritance:
- name: X-linked Recessive
  description: >
    Hemophilia A is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Males with one copy
    of the mutated F8 gene are affected, while females are typically carriers but
    may have mild symptoms due to X-inactivation.
pathophysiology:
- name: Factor VIII Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in the F8 gene lead to reduced production or dysfunction of factor VIII,
    a cofactor essential for the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. FVIII functions
    as a cofactor for factor IXa in the activation of factor X, forming the tenase
    complex on activated platelet surfaces.

  description: >
    The intrinsic pathway amplification loop is disrupted. Factor VIII normally
    accelerates factor IXa-mediated activation of factor X by approximately 200,000-fold.
    Without functional FVIII, this amplification is severely impaired.

  Hemophilia A management has evolved dramatically from plasma-derived products

  like emicizumab. Gene therapy represents a potential cure, with ongoing clinical
  trials showing durable factor VIII expression. The development of inhibitors
  remains the most challenging complication, requiring specialized treatment approaches.
