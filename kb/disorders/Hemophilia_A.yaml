has_subtypes:
- name: Severe Hemophilia A
  description: Factor VIII activity less than 1%, spontaneous bleeding episodes.

pathophysiology:
- name: Factor VIII Deficiency
  description: >
    Mutations in the F8 gene cause deficient or dysfunctional factor VIII protein.
    Factor VIII is a cofactor for factor IXa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway,
    essential for thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "FVIII acts as a cofactor in the factor Xa-generating enzyme complex of the intrinsic coagulation cascade."

  - reference: PMID:34197690
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Hemophilia A and B are rare X-linked inherited bleeding disorders caused by complete or partial deficiency in or the absence of coagulation factors VIII and IX."
    explanation: Clinical review confirms Factor VIII deficiency as the cause of hemophilia A.
- name: Impaired Thrombin Generation
  description: >
    Without functional factor VIII, the intrinsic tenase complex cannot form
    efficiently. This results in inadequate thrombin generation and unstable
    fibrin clot formation, leading to prolonged bleeding.

    snippet: "Hemophilia is a congenital clotting factor deficiency characterized by spontaneous and trauma-related bleeding."
    explanation: Spontaneous and trauma-related bleeding in hemophilia manifests as easy bruising due to defective clot formation.

    snippet: "Spontaneous bleeding shows a predilection for joints, and repeated hemarthroses lead to a disabling condition called hemophilic arthropathy."
    explanation: While joints are the primary site, the same pathophysiology causes bleeding into muscles; spontaneous bleeding is characteristic of hemophilia.
