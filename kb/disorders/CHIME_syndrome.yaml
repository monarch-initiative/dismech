- name: PIGL Gene Mutations
  description: Mutations in PIGL gene disrupt glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. PIGL encodes a de-N-acetylase required for GPI anchor formation, essential for anchoring various cell surface proteins including receptors, enzymes, and adhesion molecules.

    snippet: "CHIME syndrome is characterized by colobomas, heart defects, ichthyosiform dermatosis, mental retardation (intellectual disability), and ear anomalies, including conductive hearing loss. Whole-exome sequencing on five previously reported cases identified PIGL, the de-N-acetylase required for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor formation, as a strong candidate."
    explanation: Establishes PIGL mutations as the cause of CHIME syndrome and describes the gene's role in GPI anchor biosynthesis.
- name: GPI Anchor Deficiency
  description: Reduced levels of GPI-anchored proteins on cell surface due to impaired biosynthesis, affecting normal cellular functions and signaling pathways. This leads to the multisystem phenotype characteristic of CHIME syndrome.

- name: PIGL
  association: Causal
  notes: Autosomal recessive mutations in PIGL gene cause CHIME syndrome. Most cases show compound heterozygous mutations with c.500T>C (p.Leu167Pro) being frequently observed. Mutations include point mutations, insertions, deletions, and Alu-mediated intragenic deletions.

    snippet: "CHIME syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive neuroectodermal disorder associated with biallelic mutations in PIGL. To date, six molecularly confirmed cases of CHIME syndrome have been reported. Here, we report the seventh patient with biallelic PIGL mutations associated with CHIME syndrome and describe the first characterization of an intragenic deletion in PIGL."
    explanation: Knight Johnson et al. 2017 documents the first Alu-mediated intragenic deletion in PIGL as a disease-causing mechanism in CHIME syndrome, expanding the mutation spectrum beyond point mutations.

    snippet: "In CHIME syndrome, a recurrent missense mutation c.500T > C (p.Leu167Pro) is found in the majority of patients, associated with a null mutation in the other allele, including an overrepresentation of large deletions. The latter are not detected by the standard analysis in sequencing techniques, including next-generation sequencing. Thus, in individuals with a clinical diagnosis of CHIME syndrome in which only one mutation is found, an active search for a large deletion should be sought."
    explanation: Ceroni et al. 2018 establishes that large deletions are a common mutational mechanism in CHIME syndrome, often missed by standard sequencing, and recommends active screening for deletions in diagnostic workup.

    explanation: Rolland et al. 2022 documents a novel p.(Asp52Asn) PIGL variant and demonstrates phenotypic heterogeneity in CHIME syndrome, including mild phenotypes with atypical features, emphasizing genotype-phenotype variation.

review_notes: CHIME syndrome is an extremely rare autosomal recessive neuroectodermal disorder with a distinctive phenotype. Early recognition is important due to potential cardiac complications and need for multidisciplinary care. Notably, a possible association with malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) has been documented in at least one patient, warranting long-term hematologic surveillance. More than eight cases have been molecularly confirmed, with varying phenotypic presentations beyond the classic CHIME acronym features.
