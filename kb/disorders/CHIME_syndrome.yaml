name: CHIME_syndrome
description: A rare autosomal recessive neuroectodermal disorder characterized by colobomas, congenital heart defects, ichthyosiform dermatosis, intellectual disability, and ear anomalies caused by mutations in the PIGL gene affecting glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis.
category: Genetic
parents:
- Neuroectodermal Disorder
synonyms:
- Zunich neuroectodermal syndrome
- Coloboma-heart-ichthyosis-mental retardation-ear syndrome
prevalence:
- population: Global
  percentage: 0.000001
pathophysiology:
- name: PIGL Gene Mutations
  description: Mutations in PIGL gene disrupt glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. PIGL encodes a de-N-acetylase required for GPI anchor formation, essential for anchoring various cell surface proteins including receptors, enzymes, and adhesion molecules.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthetic process
    term:
      id: GO:0006506
      label: GPI anchor biosynthetic process
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:22444671
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "CHIME syndrome is characterized by colobomas, heart defects, ichthyosiform dermatosis, mental retardation (intellectual disability), and ear anomalies, including conductive hearing loss. Whole-exome sequencing on five previously reported cases identified PIGL, the de-N-acetylase required for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor formation, as a strong candidate."
    explanation: Establishes PIGL mutations as the cause of CHIME syndrome and describes the gene's role in GPI anchor biosynthesis.
- name: GPI Anchor Deficiency
  description: Reduced levels of GPI-anchored proteins on cell surface due to impaired biosynthesis, affecting normal cellular functions and signaling pathways. This leads to the multisystem phenotype characteristic of CHIME syndrome.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:22444671
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Furthermore, cell lines derived from these cases had significantly reduced levels of the two GPI anchor markers, CD59 and a GPI-binding toxin, aerolysin (FLAER), confirming the pathogenicity of the mutations."
    explanation: Demonstrates functional consequences of PIGL mutations showing reduced GPI anchor markers in patient cells.

review_notes: CHIME syndrome is an extremely rare autosomal recessive neuroectodermal disorder with a distinctive phenotype. Early recognition is important due to potential cardiac complications and need for multidisciplinary care. Only eight cases have been reported to date, all with nearly identical phenotypes.
