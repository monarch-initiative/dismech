description: 'Biotinidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of biotin recycling caused by biallelic pathogenic
  variants in the BTD gene. Deficient biotinidase activity impairs cleavage of biocytin and biotinyl-peptides, leading to
  depletion of free biotin and secondary functional deficiency of biotin-dependent carboxylases (pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA
  carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl- CoA carboxylase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase). This results in metabolic acidosis, organic
  aciduria, and multisystem injury predominantly affecting the nervous system, skin, eyes, and auditory system. Profound deficiency
  (<10% residual activity) and partial deficiency (10-30%) are distinguished biochemically. Lifelong oral biotin supplementation
  is highly effective and prevents symptoms when initiated early through newborn screening. Delayed diagnosis can lead to
  irreversible neurological damage, hearing loss, and optic atrophy.

    explanation: Documents hearing loss as a significant complication requiring audiological management.
notes: 'Biotinidase deficiency is one of the most treatable inborn errors of metabolism. The key clinical message is that
  early diagnosis through newborn screening and prompt lifelong biotin supplementation prevent virtually all clinical manifestations.
  Delayed diagnosis carries risk of irreversible neurological damage, hearing loss, and optic atrophy. The disorder has two
  severity classes based on residual enzyme activity: profound (<10%) and partial (10-30%). A systematic review of 1113 cases
  found that no deaths occurred among individuals detected by newborn screening and treated pre-symptomatically. Genotype-phenotype
  correlations show c.1270G>C (p.Asp424His) is associated with partial deficiency while c.410G>A (p.Arg137His) and frameshift
  variants are associated with profound deficiency and more severe clinical outcomes.


  Prevalence: Global incidence is commonly cited as approximately 1:40,000-1:60,000. Significant regional variation exists,
  with higher rates in populations with elevated consanguinity. Turkey reports national incidence of approximately 1:7,116
  and as high as 1:2,359 in some regions.


  Progression: Without treatment, biotinidase deficiency progresses from subclinical biotin depletion to functional multiple
  carboxylase deficiency, then metabolic decompensation with organic aciduria and lactic acidosis, and finally tissue injury
  with irreversible neurological, auditory, and visual sequelae. Earlier diagnosis and treatment improve reversibility, with
  prompt biotin able to reverse seizures and motor signs. Neurological deficits become permanent once established.'
