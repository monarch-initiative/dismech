- name: TBX5 Haploinsufficiency and Enhancer Dysfunction
  description: >
    Holt-Oram syndrome is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in TBX5,
    a T-box
    transcription factor that acts as a dosage-sensitive regulator of cardiac and
    forelimb development.
    TBX5 haploinsufficiency disrupts enhancer accessibility and 3D chromatin architecture
    at
    regulatory regions controlling genes essential for atrial identity, chamber septation,
    and
    conduction system development. In the limb, TBX5 is critical for forelimb bud
    initiation and
    radial patterning in the lateral plate mesoderm. TBX5 cooperates with cardiac
    transcription
    factors GATA4 and NKX2-5 at conserved enhancers and requires chromatin remodeling
    partners
    (BAF/SWI-SNF and NuRD/CHD4) to maintain cell-type-specific gene expression programs.

  description: >
    TBX5 function depends critically on physical interactions with cardiac transcription
    factor
    GATA4 and the chromatin modulating protein ZFPM2/FOG2, which together co-occupy
    atrial-specific
    enhancers controlling genes required for atrial conduction and calcium handling.
    Additionally,
    TBX5 directly interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes including CHD4 (NuRD)
    and SMARCA4/BRG1
    (BAF/SWI-SNF) to maintain accessible chromatin at cardiac enhancers. Reduced TBX5
    dosage impairs
    the formation and maintenance of these enhancer-promoter loops and topologically
    associating
    domains (TADs), leading to widespread transcriptional dysregulation of conduction
    and chamber
    specification genes.

notes: >
  Holt-Oram syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an estimated
  incidence of
  1 in 100,000 live births, characterized by the combination of cardiac and upper
  limb abnormalities
  caused by mutations in the TBX5 gene located on chromosome 12q24.1. The disorder
  exhibits near
  complete penetrance with variable expressivity, with approximately 60% of cases
  being familial and
  40% sporadic. Clinical manifestations are highly variable, ranging from subtle cardiac
  conduction
  abnormalities with minimal or no limb involvement to severe cardiac defects (septal
  defects in 75%
  of cases) and bilateral upper limb malformations. The recent discovery of TBX5-dependent
  enhancer
  networks and chromatin remodeling mechanisms provides molecular insight into the
  pathophysiology
  underlying both cardiac and limb phenotypes. Advanced cardiac interventions including
  pacemaker
  implantation may be required for managing conduction abnormalities. Genetic counseling
  is strongly
  recommended for affected families due to the high penetrance and inheritance pattern.
