notes: |
  ACHOO syndrome is a benign, common trait affecting approximately 18-35% of the
  population depending on study methodology. Prevalence varies significantly across
  populations (25.6% Chinese, 3.1% Japanese) which may reflect survey methodology
  differences. The condition has occupational/safety relevance for drivers exiting
  tunnels and pilots during abrupt light transitions. The acronym stands for
  Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helioophthalmic Outburst. First described by Collie
  et al. in 1978 (PMID:728575), though observed since Aristotle. The photic sneeze
  is not a classical brainstem reflex but involves cortical processing areas.
  Multiple mechanistic hypotheses remain under investigation, and systematic
  parametric studies of stimulus conditions are still needed.
