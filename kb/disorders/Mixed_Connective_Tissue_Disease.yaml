description: >-
  An autoimmune overlap syndrome characterized by features of systemic lupus
  erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis, with high titers of
  anti-U1 RNP antibodies. Patients typically present with Raynaud's phenomenon,
  swollen hands, arthritis, and myositis.
pathophysiology:
- name: Anti-U1 RNP Autoimmunity
  description: >-
    High-titer antibodies against U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 RNP)
    are the serological hallmark. These antibodies may directly contribute to
    disease through immune complex formation and cellular dysfunction.

    snippet: "Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) is a rare complex systemic autoimmune disease (SAD) characterized by the presence of increased levels of anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein autoantibodies and signs and symptoms that resemble other SADs such as systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)."
    explanation: This epigenome-wide study confirms anti-U1-RNP antibodies as the defining serological feature of MCTD, with pervasive hypomethylation at interferon-related genes (MX1, PARP9, DDX60, IFI44L) supporting the central role of this autoimmune response in disease pathogenesis.
- name: T Cell-Mediated Inflammation
  description: >-
    CD4+ T cells recognizing U1 RNP antigens drive the autoimmune response.
    Th1 and Th17 cytokines contribute to tissue inflammation and damage
    across multiple organ systems.

    snippet: "Among the MCTD patients, patients with the SLE immunophenotype had higher proportions of Th1 cells"
    explanation: Machine learning-based immunophenotyping revealed that MCTD patients with SLE-like features show significantly elevated Th1 cells (2.85% vs 1.33%, P=0.027) and plasmablasts, with enhanced interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma responses in central memory CD8+ T cells, demonstrating the central role of T cell-driven inflammation in disease heterogeneity.
- name: Vascular Dysfunction
  description: >-
    Endothelial injury and proliferative vasculopathy similar to systemic
    sclerosis contribute to Raynaud's phenomenon and may lead to pulmonary
    arterial hypertension in some patients.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "It is the cutaneous symptom of a systemic vasculopathy that is characterized by intimal fibrosis and blood vessel obliteration that frequently leads to visceral involvement, particularly pulmonary hypertension."
    explanation: Raynaud phenomenon in MCTD reflects an underlying systemic vasculopathy with intimal fibrosis and vascular obliteration, providing the mechanistic link between endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension development.

    snippet: "Pooled prevalence of PAH in MCTD patients was 12.53% [95% CI 8.30-18.48%]"
    explanation: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 983 MCTD patients establishes pulmonary arterial hypertension as a significant vascular complication, occurring in approximately 12.5% of patients, with mortality rates reaching up to 81.8% in affected individuals.
- name: Muscle Inflammation
  description: >-
    Inflammatory myopathy with lymphocytic infiltration of skeletal muscle
    leads to proximal muscle weakness, similar to polymyositis.

    snippet: "In biopsied muscle specimens, common findings were mild myogenic change, increased necrotic and regenerating fibers, and inflammatory infiltrates predominating in the perivascular region."
    explanation: This 2025 case series of nine MCTD myositis patients demonstrates the characteristic inflammatory myopathy with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration, and atypical weakness patterns affecting proximal and axial muscles, reflecting the heterogeneity of MCTD-associated muscle involvement.
- name: Type I Interferon Signature
  description: >-
    Pervasive DNA hypomethylation at interferon-inducible genes drives constitutive
    type I interferon pathway activation. This epigenetic signature is shared with
    SLE and Sjogren syndrome but is particularly pronounced in MCTD, contributing
    to immune dysregulation and disease heterogeneity.

  - preferred_term: Type I Interferon Signaling Pathway

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "We observed a pervasive hypomethylation involving 170 genes enriched for immune-related function such as those involved in type I interferon signaling pathways or in negative regulation of viral genome replication."
    explanation: The first epigenome-wide association study in MCTD revealed widespread DNA hypomethylation at interferon-related genes (MX1, PARP9, DDX60, IFI44L) with evidence that genetic variants at IRF7 and IFI44 may exert disease risk through DNA methylation changes, establishing type I interferon pathway activation as a central molecular mechanism shared with SLE and Sjogren syndrome.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Raynaud's phenomenon affects most patients who have mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and frequently represents the initial manifestation of the disease."
    explanation: Raynaud phenomenon is nearly universal in MCTD and often the presenting symptom, reflecting the underlying systemic vasculopathy characterized by intimal fibrosis and vascular obliteration that links this cutaneous manifestation to visceral complications including pulmonary hypertension.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Arthritis occurred in all 20 patients, being the presenting complaint in 11 patients."
    explanation: This landmark 5-year longitudinal study demonstrated that arthritis is universal in MCTD, often as the presenting manifestation, with symmetric involvement of PIP, MCP, wrists, MTP joints and knees mimicking rheumatoid arthritis but with predominantly lymphocytic non-inflammatory effusions and good response to low-dose corticosteroids.

    snippet: "Eight patients had muscle weakness in the proximal extremities, and overall, six patients had atypical weakness in the face, neck, wrist, or fingers."
    explanation: MCTD-associated myositis presents with both typical proximal muscle weakness and atypical distributions affecting axial and distal muscles, with muscle biopsy showing perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and muscle fiber necrosis, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of MCTD myopathy that may require intensive immunosuppressive therapy.
