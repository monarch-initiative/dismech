description: >-
  Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of
  the gastrointestinal tract, arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal or their
  precursors. GISTs are characterized by activating mutations in KIT (85%) or PDGFRA
  (10%) receptor tyrosine kinases, which drive constitutive kinase activation and
  tumor growth. The identification of these driver mutations revolutionized treatment,
  with imatinib demonstrating dramatic responses and establishing GIST as a paradigm
  for targeted therapy in solid tumors.

has_subtypes:
- name: KIT-mutant GIST
  description: >-
    Approximately 85% of GISTs harbor activating mutations in KIT, most commonly
    in exon 11 (juxtamembrane domain) but also in exons 9, 13, and 17. Different
    mutations confer variable sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
- name: PDGFRA-mutant GIST
  description: >-
    Approximately 10% of GISTs harbor PDGFRA mutations, typically exon 18 D842V
    which is resistant to imatinib. These tumors often arise in the stomach and
    have an epithelioid morphology.
- name: Wild-type GIST
  description: >-
    Approximately 10-15% of GISTs lack KIT or PDGFRA mutations. This group includes
    SDH-deficient GISTs (pediatric/young adult), NF1-associated GISTs, and GISTs
    with BRAF, RAS, or receptor tyrosine kinase fusions.
pathophysiology:
- name: KIT Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Activation
  description: >-
    Gain-of-function mutations in KIT result in constitutive receptor dimerization
    and kinase activation without ligand (stem cell factor) binding. This drives
    downstream signaling through RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, promoting cell
    proliferation and survival.

    explanation: This landmark NEJM study established that constitutive KIT
      activation is the critical driver of GIST pathogenesis.
- name: PDGFRA Receptor Activation
  description: >-
    PDGFRA mutations, particularly D842V in the activation loop, result in
    constitutive kinase activity. These mutations activate similar downstream
    pathways as KIT but show different drug sensitivity profiles.

  description: >-
    Constitutive KIT or PDGFRA activation drives the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling
    cascade, promoting cell proliferation. This pathway represents a potential
    therapeutic target when primary resistance to KIT/PDGFRA inhibitors occurs.

    Constitutive KIT or PDGFRA activation recruits PI3K and activates the
    PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling cascade, promoting cell survival and resistance
    to apoptosis. This pathway cooperates with MAPK signaling to drive tumorigenesis.

  notes: >-
    Approximately 95% of GISTs are positive for KIT (CD117) by immunohistochemistry,
    making this the primary diagnostic marker. DOG1 (Discovered on GIST-1) is another
    sensitive and specific marker.
- name: Molecular Genotyping
  notes: >-
    Mutational analysis of KIT exons 9, 11, 13, 17 and PDGFRA exon 18 is essential
    for predicting TKI response. Secondary resistance mutations should be assessed
    at progression.
genetic:
- name: KIT
  association: Somatic Activating Mutations
  notes: >-
    KIT mutations occur in approximately 85% of GISTs. Exon 11 mutations (juxtamembrane
    domain) are most common and predict good imatinib response. Exon 9 mutations
    require higher imatinib doses. Exon 13/17 mutations are less common.
- name: PDGFRA
  association: Somatic Activating Mutations
  notes: >-
    PDGFRA mutations occur in approximately 10% of GISTs. The D842V mutation in
    exon 18 is most common and confers primary resistance to imatinib but responds
    to avapritinib.

    kinases. Standard dose is 400 mg daily, but exon 9 KIT mutations require 800 mg.
