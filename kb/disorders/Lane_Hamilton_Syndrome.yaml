pathophysiology:
  - name: Gluten-triggered intestinal autoimmunity in celiac disease
    description: >
      Lane Hamilton Syndrome begins with celiac disease, an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten ingestion
      in genetically predisposed individuals. Gluten exposure activates intestinal immune responses with increased
      intraepithelial lymphocytes, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia in the small intestine, particularly the duodenum.
      This localized intestinal autoimmunity generates systemic immune activation and circulating autoantibodies,
      including anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies.

    description: >
      Systemic immune mediators generated by intestinal celiac disease act on the pulmonary microvasculature,
      increasing capillary endothelial permeability without causing vasculitis or immune complex deposition.
      Mediators such as histamine (released by eosinophils and basophils), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP),
      and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increase endothelial gap formation between capillary
      endothelial cells. This allows erythrocyte extravasation into the alveolar space in the absence of
      structural vascular damage or capillaritis.

  - name: Alveolar hemorrhage and hemosiderin accumulation
    description: >
      Increased capillary permeability allows red blood cells and hemoglobin to escape into the alveolar space,
      causing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Alveolar macrophages rapidly phagocytose the extravasated
      erythrocytes and break down hemoglobin, converting iron and heme into hemosiderin. These hemosiderin-laden
      macrophages (HLM) accumulate in alveolar spaces and can be detected via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or
      lung biopsy, serving as a hallmark histologic finding of prior alveolar bleeding.

    description: >
      Chronic recurrent alveolar hemorrhage leads to progressive iron and heme overload in the alveolar space,
      driving oxidative stress through iron-catalyzed free radical generation (Fenton reaction) and heme-driven
      lipid peroxidation. Oxidative injury damages alveolar epithelial cells, triggering type II pneumocyte
      hyperplasia as a reparative response. Over time, recurrent cycles of hemorrhage, oxidative injury, and
      epithelial repair may progress to pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory impairment if the underlying celiac
      disease is not controlled.

      Elimination of gluten from diet is foundational therapy for Lane Hamilton Syndrome, as it addresses the
      underlying celiac disease trigger. Many LHS cases achieve remission or significant improvement with strict,
      lifelong gluten-free diet adherence. Relapse commonly occurs with dietary nonadherence, emphasizing the
