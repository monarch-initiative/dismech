name: BRAF-Mutant Papillary Thyroid Cancer
description: >-
  BRAF-mutant papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is a molecularly-defined subset of
  differentiated thyroid cancer harboring activating BRAF mutations, most commonly
  BRAF V600E. This mutation occurs in approximately 40-60% of papillary thyroid
  carcinomas and is associated with aggressive clinicopathological features including
  extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, and radioiodine refractoriness.
  The identification of BRAF V600E as a driver oncogene led to development of targeted
  therapy with BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib) in combination with MEK inhibitors
  (trametinib) for radioiodine-refractory disease, providing effective options
  beyond traditional cytotoxic therapy.

has_subtypes:
- name: BRAF V600E-Mutant PTC
  description: >-
    Most common BRAF mutation, accounting for >95% of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancers.
    V600E causes constitutive kinase activation and is targetable with BRAF/MEK
    inhibitor combinations.
- name: BRAF V600K and Other BRAF Mutations
  description: >-
    Rare non-V600E BRAF mutations occur in a small subset of thyroid cancers.
    May have different biological behavior and therapeutic implications.
pathophysiology:
- name: BRAF V600E Constitutive Activation
  description: >-
    The BRAF V600E mutation causes constitutive activation of the RAF kinase
    by mimicking the phosphorylated active state. This results in ligand-independent
    activation of the MAPK pathway driving thyroid follicular cell proliferation
    and dedifferentiation.

  - target: Thyroid Dedifferentiation
    description: MAPK activation suppresses thyroid differentiation gene expression
- name: MEK-ERK Pathway Hyperactivation
  description: >-
    Mutant BRAF constitutively phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2, leading to
    sustained ERK1/2 activation. This drives uncontrolled proliferation and is
    the rationale for combined BRAF/MEK inhibition therapy.

    modifier: INCREASED
    term:
      id: GO:0007165
      label: signal transduction
- name: Thyroid Dedifferentiation
  description: >-
    BRAF V600E-driven MAPK activation suppresses expression of thyroid differentiation
    genes including NIS (sodium-iodide symporter), leading to radioiodine refractoriness.
    This loss of differentiation is associated with more aggressive disease behavior.
