description: 'Tyrosinemia type I (HT-1) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of tyrosine metabolism caused by deficiency
  of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the terminal enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. FAH deficiency leads to accumulation
  of toxic intermediates including fumarylacetoacetate (FAA), maleylacetoacetate (MAA), and succinylacetone (SA). FAA is highly
  reactive and mutagenic, causing oxidative damage to hepatocytes via glutathione depletion and mitochondrial cytochrome c
  release with caspase-mediated apoptosis. SA inhibits delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, causing porphyria-like neurovisceral
  crises. Untreated disease leads to acute liver failure, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal tubular dysfunction,
  and neurological crises. Nitisinone (NTBC) combined with dietary tyrosine and phenylalanine restriction is the standard
  of care, dramatically improving survival, though residual risk of hepatocellular carcinoma persists even under continuous
  therapy. Global incidence is approximately 1 in 100,000.

    snippet: The patient is currently undergoing treatment with capsule nitisinone 5 mg, which inhibits the second step of
      tyrosine degradation to prevent tyrosinemia, along with a restricted protein diet, while awaiting liver transplantation.
    explanation: Confirms liver transplantation as a treatment option for severe cases.

  description: 'NBS for HT-1 using dried blood spot succinylacetone measurement is recommended, as it is superior to tyrosine-based
    screening. Early identification enables pre-symptomatic NTBC initiation for optimal long-term outcomes.

    snippet: Newborn screening (NBS) utilizing blood succinylacetone as the NBS marker is superior to observing tyrosine levels
      as a way of identifying neonates with HT-1.
    explanation: Strong consensus supporting SA-based NBS for HT-1.

    snippet: While SA was long considered to be elevated in every TT1 patient, here we present a recent false-negative SA
      TT1 screen.
    explanation: Highlights that NBS can have rare false negatives requiring protocol optimization.

    explanation: Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern supports the role of genetic counseling.

  description: 'Long-term neurocognitive assessment is recommended for HT-1 patients, as they are at risk for neurocognitive
    impairment even under NTBC therapy. Early intervention and educational support may improve outcomes.

    snippet: They are also at risk of long-term neurocognitive impairment, which highlights the need for neurocognitive assessment
      and therapy.
    explanation: Directly recommends neurocognitive assessment and therapy for HT-1 patients.
notes: 'HT-1 is classified into acute (presentation before 6 months), subacute (6-12 months), and chronic (after 12 months)
  forms based on age of presentation. The acute form, presenting with liver failure in early infancy, carries the worst prognosis
  without treatment. With universal newborn screening and early NTBC therapy, the natural history has been dramatically altered.
  However, long-term HCC risk persists even with optimal medical management, and liver transplantation remains necessary for
  a subset of patients. Residual SA production by the kidneys continues after liver transplantation, requiring ongoing monitoring.
