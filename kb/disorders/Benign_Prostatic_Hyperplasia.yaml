    snippet: "Proliferative nodular formation represents a characteristic pathological
      feature of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and serves as the primary cause
      for prostate volume enlargement and consequent lower urinary tract symptoms
      (LUTS)."
    explanation: This evidence confirms that proliferative nodular formation in
      the transition zone is the primary pathological feature driving BPH
      symptoms.
- name: Bladder Outlet Obstruction
  description: >
    Enlarged prostate compresses urethra, increasing resistance to
    urine flow. Static component from tissue mass and dynamic
    component from smooth muscle tone.

  description: >
    Chronic obstruction leads to detrusor muscle hypertrophy and
    later decompensation. Results in overactive bladder symptoms
    and incomplete emptying.

    snippet: "Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is caused by the nonmalignant enlargement
      of the transition zone of the prostate gland, leading to lower urinary tract
      symptoms."
    explanation: This evidence supports that BPH-related enlargement causes
      lower urinary tract symptoms through bladder outlet obstruction and
      detrusor dysfunction.
- name: Androgen-Dependent Growth
  description: >
    DHT converted from testosterone by 5-alpha reductase drives
    prostatic growth. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors shrink prostate.

- name: Hypoxia-Induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition

    snippet: "A distinct subgroup of basal epithelial (BE) cells, referred to as BE5,
      was identified to play a crucial role in driving this progression through the
      hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway."
    explanation: This evidence identifies BE5 cells as key drivers of BPH
      through hypoxia-induced EMT, establishing a molecular mechanism for
      nodular formation.
- name: TGF-beta/ROCK1 Mediated Stromal Hyperplasia
  description: >
    Aberrant activation of TGF-beta/ROCK1 pathway recruits mesenchymal
    stem cells that differentiate into fibroblasts and myofibroblasts,
    driving stromal hyperplasia and fibrosis.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: TGF-beta Signaling
    term:

    snippet: "The aberrant activation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Rho
      kinase 1 (ROCK1) increased the stemness of BPH tissue by recruiting mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs), indicating the important role of embryonic reawakening in
      BPH."
    explanation: This evidence demonstrates that TGF-beta/ROCK1 activation
      drives prostatic stromal hyperplasia through MSC recruitment and
      differentiation.
  - reference: PMID:39455522
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "ROCK1 and ROCK2 were significantly up-regulated in BPH tissues, correlating
      with clinical parameters."

      tissues and their correlation with disease severity.
- name: ROCK-Mediated Fibrosis and Beta-Catenin Signaling
  description: >
    ROCK1/2 activation promotes fibrosis, EMT, and cell proliferation by
    stabilizing beta-catenin and activating downstream targets including
    C-MYC, Snail, and Survivin. ROCK inhibition reverses these processes.

  - preferred_term: Want Signaling Pathway
    term:
      id: GO:0016055
      label: Want signaling pathway
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:39455522
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "ROCK downregulation inhibited the β-catenin signaling pathway (such
      as C-MYC, Snail and Survivin) and decreased β-catenin protein stability, while
      inhibiting TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling."
    explanation: This evidence shows ROCK signaling converges on beta-catenin
      pathway to drive BPH pathophysiology, providing a therapeutic target.
- name: Oxidative Stress and Epithelial Plasticity
  description: >
    Low-androgen signaling epithelial populations show increased vulnerability
    to oxidative stress due to reduced antioxidant defenses. Mitochondrial
    ROS drives cell proliferation and stemness in BPH.

      stress due to reduction of antioxidant enzyme expression. One-month treatment
      of Pb-PRL mice with anethole trithione (ATT), a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial
      ROS production, reduced prostate weight and voiding frequency."
    explanation: This evidence demonstrates that oxidative stress contributes to
      BPH progression and that antioxidant therapy can reduce prostate
      enlargement and symptoms.
- name: Inflammation and IL-6 Signaling
  description: >
    Periodontal pathogens and inflammatory stimuli upregulate IL-6, IL-6R,
    and gp130, activating the Akt pathway to promote epithelial and stromal
    proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Inflammatory Response

      apoptosis, and upregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6
      (IL-6; 4.47-fold), interleukin-6 receptor-α (IL-6Rα; 5.74-fold) and glycoprotein
      130 (gp130; 4.47-fold) in prostatic tissue."
    explanation: This evidence links oral-prostate inflammation to BPH
      progression through IL-6/IL-6R/gp130-mediated Akt signaling, representing
      a novel pathophysiological axis.
