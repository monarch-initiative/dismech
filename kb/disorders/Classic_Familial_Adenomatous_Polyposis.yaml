description: >-
  Classic familial adenomatous polyposis (classic FAP) is an autosomal dominant
  APC-associated polyposis syndrome characterized by extensive colorectal adenoma
  burden beginning early in life and very high colorectal cancer risk without
  definitive preventive management. Disease progression follows an APC-initiated
  adenoma-to-carcinoma trajectory with cooperative WNT, PI3K/mTOR, and genomic
  instability mechanisms, while upper gastrointestinal and extracolonic disease
  manifestations remain clinically important across adulthood.
