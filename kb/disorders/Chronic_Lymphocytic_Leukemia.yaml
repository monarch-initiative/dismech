description: >-
  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries,
  characterized by clonal expansion of mature-appearing CD5+ B lymphocytes in blood,
  bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. The clinical course is highly variable, ranging
  from indolent disease requiring no treatment to aggressive forms. Prognosis is
  stratified by IGHV mutation status, cytogenetics (del(17p), del(11q), del(13q)),
  and TP53 mutations. Treatment has been revolutionized by BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib,
  acalabrutinib) and BCL2 inhibitors (venetoclax), enabling chemotherapy-free regimens
  with deep remissions.

has_subtypes:
- name: IGHV Mutated CLL
  description: >-
    CLL with somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region
    genes (at least 2% deviation from germline). Associated with favorable prognosis,
    lower risk of progression, and better responses to chemoimmunotherapy. Represents
    post-germinal center B-cell origin.
- name: IGHV Unmutated CLL
  description: >-
    CLL without significant IGHV somatic hypermutation (less than 2% deviation from
    germline). Associated with more aggressive course, higher risk of progression,
    and inferior outcomes with chemoimmunotherapy. May benefit particularly from
    novel targeted agents.
pathophysiology:
- name: B-cell Receptor Signaling Dysregulation
  description: >-
    CLL cells exhibit constitutive B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, either through
    autonomous signaling or antigen-driven activation. This chronic BCR stimulation
    activates downstream kinases including BTK, PI3K, and SYK, driving proliferation
    and survival. BCR signaling intensity correlates with clinical aggressiveness.

- name: BTK Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is essential for BCR signaling and CLL cell survival.
    BTK activation promotes NF-kB signaling, cell adhesion, and tissue homing.
    BTK inhibitors disrupt these signals, mobilizing CLL cells from protective
    tissue microenvironments and inducing apoptosis.

    description: BTK activates NF-kB-mediated anti-apoptotic gene expression
- name: Microenvironmental Survival Signals
  description: >-
    CLL cells depend on interactions with the tissue microenvironment including
    nurse-like cells, T cells, and stromal cells in lymph nodes and bone marrow.
    These interactions provide survival signals through chemokines, cytokines,
    and direct cell contact. Disrupting these interactions is therapeutically
    important.

    description: Microenvironmental support enables CLL expansion
- name: NF-kB Activation and Survival
  description: >-
    NF-kB transcription factors are constitutively activated in CLL and promote
    expression of anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2, MCL1, and XIAP. This
    contributes to the apoptosis resistance characteristic of CLL cells.

    The combination of defective apoptosis, microenvironmental support, and
    low-level proliferation leads to progressive accumulation of clonal B cells.
    CLL is primarily a disease of accumulation rather than rapid proliferation.

- name: Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping
  notes: >-
    CLL cells are CD5+, CD19+, CD23+, CD20 dim, surface Ig dim. The
    characteristic immunophenotype distinguishes CLL from other B-cell
    lymphomas and mantle cell lymphoma (CD5+ but CD23-).
- name: IGHV Mutation Analysis
  notes: >-
    Sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region determines
    mutational status. Mutated IGHV (at least 2% difference from germline)
    indicates favorable prognosis.
genetic:
- name: TP53 Mutation/del(17p)
  association: High-Risk Prognostic Marker
  notes: >-
    TP53 alterations (mutation or del(17p)) occur in 5-10% at diagnosis,
    higher in relapsed disease. Confer resistance to chemoimmunotherapy
    and poor prognosis. BTK and BCL2 inhibitors remain effective.
- name: del(11q)/ATM
  association: Intermediate-Risk Marker
  notes: >-
    Deletion of 11q23 affects the ATM gene, impairing DNA damage responses.
    Associated with bulky lymphadenopathy and intermediate prognosis.
    May benefit from targeted therapies.
- name: del(13q)
  association: Favorable Prognostic Marker
  notes: >-
    Isolated del(13q14) is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in CLL
    and is associated with favorable prognosis when present alone. This
    region contains microRNA genes miR-15a and miR-16-1.
- name: IGHV
  association: Prognostic Marker
  notes: >-
    IGHV mutation status is one of the strongest prognostic markers in CLL.
    Mutated IGHV indicates post-germinal center origin with better prognosis.
    Unmutated IGHV indicates more aggressive disease course.
