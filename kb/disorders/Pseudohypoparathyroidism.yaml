description: >-
  Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a group of disorders caused by impaired
  signaling at the GNAS locus, producing resistance to parathyroid hormone and,
  in many patients, additional endocrine and developmental abnormalities. The
  phenotype reflects both parent-of-origin effects (imprinting) and tissue-specific
  dependence on Gs alpha signaling.
