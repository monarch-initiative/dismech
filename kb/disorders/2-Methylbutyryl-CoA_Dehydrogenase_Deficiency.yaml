description: '2-Methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SBCADD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of L-isoleucine
  metabolism caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the ACADSB gene encoding short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  (SBCAD). The metabolic block in the proximal isoleucine oxidation pathway leads to accumulation of diagnostic metabolites
  including elevated C5-acylcarnitine (2-methylbutyrylcarnitine) in blood and 2-methylbutyrylglycine (2-MBG) in urine. Most
  individuals identified through newborn screening remain asymptomatic, but approximately 10% of reported patients develop
  clinical manifestations including seizures, developmental delay, hypotonia, and failure to thrive. The condition is particularly
  prevalent in the Hmong population due to a founder mutation (c.1165A>G). Carnitine supplementation and avoidance of catabolic
  stress are the mainstays of management.

progression:
- phase: Neonatal/early detection
  notes: 'Most individuals are identified through newborn screening via elevated C5-acylcarnitine. The majority remain asymptomatic
    throughout life. Approximately 10% develop symptoms, typically in the neonatal period or during intercurrent illness.
    Compensation via alternative ACAD enzymes and the R-pathway of isoleucine oxidation may mask biochemical consequences
    at baseline, but this compensation can fail during metabolic stress (infection, fasting), leading to sporadic decompensation
    in susceptible individuals.

notes: 'SBCADD is a condition of uncertain clinical significance for most affected individuals. Expert consensus from 2023
  characterizes SBCAD deficiency as a biochemical abnormality with limited or no clinical consequences in most cases. However,
  the 2019 literature review cautions that considering SBCADD a non-disease in non-Hmong subjects appears unsafe, as catabolic
  stress can precipitate acute decompensation. The condition is particularly common in the Hmong population (carrier frequency
  ~22%) and in certain Chinese ethnic minorities (Miao, Dong) due to the founder c.1165A>G variant. The role of treatment
  in SBCADD remains unclear pending further delineation of its clinical phenotype and pathogenicity.
