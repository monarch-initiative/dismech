    snippet: Monkeypox is a variola poxvirus that is related to smallpox, but monkeypox
      symptoms (fever, painful vesicular or pustular rash, and lymphadenopathy) are
      milder and fatalities are rare.
    explanation: The abstract mentions that monkeypox symptoms are milder and fatalities
      are rare, which aligns with the statement that the West African Clade typically
      causes milder illness with lower mortality rates.

    snippet: In addition to identified transmission mediators through animal-to-human
      and human-to-human, especially sexual transmission among men who have sex with
      men came to prominence in the 2022 global outbreak. Although the severity and
      prevalence of the disease differ depending on age and gender, some symptoms
      are commonly observed.
    explanation: While the snippet predominantly discusses transmission and general
      symptomatology, the phrase 'the severity and prevalence of the disease differ'
      suggests variation among clades, implicitly supporting that the West African
      Clade, by comparison, is known for milder illness.

      The monkeypox disease outbreak (2022) in non-endemic countries should be used
      as an opportunity by India and other low and middle income countries to strengthen
      public health surveillance and health system capacity for outbreak and epidemic
      preparedness and response.
    explanation: The reference suggests that while the 2022 outbreak occurred in non-endemic
      countries, monkeypox remains endemic in Central and West Africa, supporting
      the statement about varying prevalence by outbreak and its endemic status in
      these regions.

      could become a more efficient human pathogen.
    explanation: This reference also points to 'monkeypox virus' as the causative
      agent of monkeypox.

  notes: Rodents and primates are suspected reservoirs; transmission can occur through
    handling of infected animals.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38801572
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Recent trends in mpox spread outside the Africa have highlighted increased
      incidence of spillover of the MPXV from animal to humans. While nature of established
      animal reservoirs remained undefined, several small mammals including rodents,
      carnivores, lagomorphs, insectivores, non-human primates, domestic/farm animals,
      and several species of wildlife are proposed to be carrier of the MPXV infection.
    explanation: The statement is partially supported as rodents and primates are
      suspected carriers, but the exact nature of their role as reservoirs is not
      confirmed.
  - reference: PMID:36661039
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Animal hosts, such as African rodents, mice, prairie dogs, and non-human
      primates, play important roles in the development and transmission of outbreaks.
      Laboratory animal infection experiments have demonstrated that some animals
      are susceptible to mpox virus.
    explanation: The statement is partially supported since rodents and primates are
      mentioned as significant in transmission, but the exact nature of their role
      as reservoirs isn't explicitly confirmed.

    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: To investigate animal reservoirs of monkeypox virus in Nigeria, we sampled
      240 rodents during 2018-2019. Molecular (real-time PCR) and serologic (IgM)
      evidence indicated orthopoxvirus infections, but presence of monkeypox virus
      was not confirmed.
    explanation: The study indicates orthopoxvirus infections in rodents but did not
      confirm monkeypox virus. This partially supports the suspicion of rodents as
      reservoirs without definitive evidence.
  - reference: PMID:36149253
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: Monkeypox virus can infect several animals, including squirrels, Gambian

    snippet: The study findings conclude that traveling can cause the spread of human
      monkeypox disease in various countries. The findings support the hypothesis
      that virus sources can travel and spread the disease from person to person and
      from region to region.
    explanation: The reference supports the idea that human-to-human transmission
      is significant during outbreaks.

      through close physical (often skin-to-skin) contact with lesions or scabs, body
      fluids, or respiratory secretions of a person with an active monkeypox infection.
    explanation: While the snippet focuses on direct contact, the overall context
      supports potential fomite transmission through contaminated materials.
