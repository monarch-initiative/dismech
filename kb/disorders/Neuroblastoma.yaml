name: Neuroblastoma
description: >-
  Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood,
  arising from neural crest-derived sympathetic nervous system precursors.
  It demonstrates remarkable clinical heterogeneity, ranging from spontaneous
  regression in infants to highly aggressive metastatic disease in older
  children. MYCN amplification, present in approximately 20% of cases, is
  the most powerful adverse prognostic marker and drives aggressive tumor
  behavior. Risk stratification based on age, stage, histology, MYCN status,
  and ploidy guides treatment intensity. Low-risk neuroblastoma may require
  only observation, while high-risk disease requires intensive multimodal
  therapy with immunotherapy.

has_subtypes:
- name: MYCN-Amplified Neuroblastoma
  description: >-
    Approximately 20% of neuroblastomas harbor MYCN gene amplification,
    associated with rapid tumor progression and poor prognosis. MYCN
    amplification is one of the earliest oncogene amplifications discovered.
- name: Stage 4S Neuroblastoma
  description: >-
    A special stage occurring in infants under 18 months with primary tumor
    and metastases limited to skin, liver, and bone marrow. Despite widespread
    disease, 4S neuroblastoma often undergoes spontaneous regression.
- name: High-Risk Neuroblastoma
  description: >-
    Defined by age over 18 months with metastatic disease, or MYCN amplification
    at any age. Requires intensive multimodal therapy including chemotherapy,
    surgery, radiation, autologous stem cell transplant, and immunotherapy.
pathophysiology:
- name: Neural Crest Developmental Arrest
  description: >-
    Neuroblastoma arises from neural crest-derived sympathoadrenal progenitor
    cells that fail to complete differentiation. The tumor cells retain
    characteristics of immature neuroblasts with variable capacity for
    sympathetic neuronal differentiation.

  description: >-
    MYCN amplification results in massive overexpression of the MYCN transcription
    factor, which drives cell cycle progression, inhibits differentiation, and
