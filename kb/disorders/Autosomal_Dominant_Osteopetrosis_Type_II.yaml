name: Autosomal Dominant Osteopetrosis Type II
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II (ADO2), also known as Albers-Schonberg
  disease, is the most common form of osteopetrosis. It is caused by heterozygous
  mutations in the CLCN7 chloride channel gene, which acts through a dominant
  negative mechanism since chloride channels function as dimers. The disease has
  incomplete penetrance (66%) and variable expressivity. Clinical features include
  increased skeletal density, recurrent fractures, osteomyelitis (particularly
  mandibular), and cranial nerve compression causing visual loss. CLCN7 mutations
  also cause autosomal recessive osteopetrosis when homozygous, establishing
  ADO2 as allelic with a subset of infantile malignant osteopetrosis.

      Autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance (66%) and variable expressivity.
      Heterozygous CLCN7 mutations exert a dominant negative effect on the chloride
      channel dimer. Unaffected gene carriers show increased bone mineral density
      without clinical disease.

pathophysiology:
  - name: CLCN7 Dominant Negative Chloride Channel Dysfunction
    description: >
      CLCN7 encodes a chloride channel that functions as a homodimer.
      Heterozygous missense mutations exert a dominant negative effect by
      incorporating mutant subunits into the dimer, impairing chloride
      transport. Loss-of-function (null) mutations in heterozygous state
      do not cause disease, confirming that the pathogenic mechanism is
      dominant negative rather than haploinsufficiency.

  - name: Impaired Resorption Lacuna Acidification
    description: >
      Dysfunctional CLCN7 chloride channels reduce the ability of osteoclasts
      to acidify the resorption lacuna, decreasing bone resorption capacity.
      Incomplete penetrance (66%) and variable expressivity reflect the
      stochastic impact of dominant negative subunit incorporation on overall
      channel function.
