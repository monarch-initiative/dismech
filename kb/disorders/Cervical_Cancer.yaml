description: >-
  Cervical cancer is a malignancy arising from the epithelium of the uterine cervix,
  with the vast majority (greater than 95%) caused by persistent infection with
  high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily types 16 and 18. The viral
  oncoproteins E6 and E7 drive carcinogenesis by inactivating the tumor suppressors
  p53 and pRB, respectively. Cervical cancer is preventable through HPV vaccination
  and detectable at preinvasive stages through screening, making it a model for
  infection-driven cancer prevention.

has_subtypes:
- name: Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    The most common histologic type, accounting for approximately 70-80% of cases.
    Arises from the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix, typically at the
    transformation zone where squamous and glandular epithelia meet.
- name: Adenocarcinoma
  description: >-
    Accounts for 20-25% of cervical cancers. Arises from the glandular epithelium
    of the endocervical canal. Often HPV-18 associated. May be more difficult to
    detect by cytology screening.
- name: Adenosquamous Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Mixed tumors with both squamous and glandular differentiation. Generally
    associated with worse prognosis than pure squamous cell carcinoma.
infectious_agent:
- name: Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
  description: >-
    High-risk HPV types, particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18, cause greater than 95%
    of cervical cancers. HPV-16 is responsible for approximately 50% of cases
    and HPV-18 for approximately 20%. Persistent infection with high-risk types
    is necessary but not sufficient for cancer development.

pathophysiology:
- name: E6 Oncoprotein-Mediated p53 Degradation
  description: >-
    The HPV E6 oncoprotein binds to the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP and
    targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. Loss of p53 function eliminates
    DNA damage checkpoints, allows cells with genomic instability to survive,
    and prevents apoptosis of infected cells.

- name: E7 Oncoprotein-Mediated pRB Inactivation
  description: >-
    The HPV E7 oncoprotein binds to and inactivates the retinoblastoma protein
    (pRB), releasing E2F transcription factors to drive uncontrolled cell cycle
    progression. E7 also targets pRB family members p107 and p130, and
    destabilizes pRB through proteasomal degradation.

    description: E2F release drives S-phase entry independent of growth signals
- name: HPV Genome Integration
  description: >-
    Integration of HPV DNA into the host genome disrupts the viral E2 gene,
    which normally represses E6/E7 expression. This results in constitutive
    overexpression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins, a critical step in malignant
    progression from CIN3 to invasive carcinoma.

    description: Loss of E2 repression leads to unchecked oncoprotein production
- name: Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Progression
  description: >-
    HPV infection induces a spectrum of preinvasive lesions graded as CIN1,
    CIN2, and CIN3 (carcinoma in situ). Low-grade lesions (CIN1) often regress,
    while high-grade lesions (CIN2/3) have significant risk of progression to
    invasive carcinoma over 10-20 years if untreated.

    of invasive disease.

    Watery, mucoid, or blood-tinged vaginal discharge may occur, sometimes
    with foul odor in advanced cases due to tumor necrosis.

biochemical:
- name: HPV DNA Testing
  notes: >-
    Detection of high-risk HPV DNA by PCR or hybrid capture is more sensitive
    than cytology for detecting high-grade lesions. HPV testing is increasingly
    used as primary screening in cervical cancer prevention programs.
- name: p16 Immunohistochemistry
  notes: >-
    Overexpression of p16INK4a is a surrogate marker for HPV E7 activity, as
    E7-mediated pRB inactivation causes compensatory p16 upregulation. Diffuse
    block-positive p16 staining helps confirm HPV-related high-grade lesions.
genetic:
- name: TP53
  association: Inactivated by E6 Oncoprotein
  notes: >-
    Rather than somatic mutation, p53 function is lost through E6-mediated
    degradation in HPV-positive cervical cancer. Rare HPV-negative cervical
    cancers may harbor TP53 mutations.
- name: PIK3CA
  association: Somatic Mutations
  notes: >-
    PIK3CA mutations occur in approximately 25-35% of cervical cancers,
    activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. May represent a therapeutic target.

- name: HPV Vaccination
  description: >-
    Prophylactic vaccination against HPV-16, 18, and other high-risk types
    prevents infection and subsequent development of cervical cancer and
    precancerous lesions. Most effective when administered before sexual debut.
