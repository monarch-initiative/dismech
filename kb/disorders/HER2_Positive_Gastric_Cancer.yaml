name: HER2-Positive Gastric Cancer
description: >-
  HER2-positive gastric cancer is a molecularly defined subtype characterized by ERBB2 (HER2)
  amplification or overexpression, occurring in approximately 15-20% of gastric and
  gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas. HER2 positivity is enriched in intestinal-type
  tumors and those at the gastroesophageal junction. Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy
  was the first targeted therapy to improve survival in gastric cancer (ToGA trial). More
  recently, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has demonstrated remarkable activity, establishing
  a new standard of care for HER2-positive gastric cancer.

pathophysiology:
- name: ERBB2 (HER2) Amplification and Overexpression
  description: >-
    ERBB2 gene amplification leads to overexpression of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase.
    High-level HER2 expression promotes constitutive receptor dimerization (particularly
    HER2 homodimers and HER2/HER3 heterodimers), leading to ligand-independent signaling.
    HER2 amplification is a driver event in gastric carcinogenesis.

    description: HER2/HER3 heterodimers potently activate PI3K signaling
- name: MAPK Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    HER2 receptor activation recruits GRB2/SOS adaptor proteins, activating RAS and the
    downstream MAPK cascade. This drives transcription of genes promoting cell proliferation,
    including cyclin D1 and MYC.

  - target: Enhanced Proliferation and Tumor Growth
    description: MAPK signaling drives cell cycle progression
- name: PI3K-AKT Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    HER2/HER3 heterodimerization is particularly effective at activating PI3K because HER3
    contains six PI3K binding motifs. PI3K activation leads to AKT phosphorylation,
    promoting cell survival, protein synthesis through mTOR, and resistance to apoptosis.
    PI3K pathway alterations may confer resistance to HER2-targeted therapy.

  description: >-
    Combined MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway activation drives uncontrolled cell proliferation
    and tumor growth. HER2-positive tumors are dependent on HER2 signaling, making them

biochemical:
- name: HER2 Immunohistochemistry
  notes: >-
    IHC scoring criteria differ from breast cancer due to heterogeneous staining and
    basolateral membrane patterns in gastric cancer. Scoring: 0 (negative), 1+ (faint),
    2+ (weak to moderate complete/basolateral staining in 10% or more of cells - requires
    ISH confirmation), 3+ (strong complete/basolateral staining in 10% or more - positive).
- name: HER2 In Situ Hybridization
  notes: >-
    FISH or other ISH methods assess HER2/CEP17 ratio. Ratio greater than 2.0 is positive.
    Required for IHC 2+ (equivocal) cases. Intratumoral heterogeneity is more common in
    gastric than breast cancer.
genetic:
- name: ERBB2 (HER2)
  association: Somatic Amplification
  notes: >-
    ERBB2 amplification occurs in 15-20% of gastric adenocarcinomas, with higher rates at
    the gastroesophageal junction (up to 30%) and in intestinal-type tumors. Copy number
    gain correlates with protein expression and clinical benefit from HER2-targeted therapy.
- name: TP53
  association: Co-occurring Mutations
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations frequently co-occur with HER2 amplification. The chromosomally unstable
    (CIN) molecular subtype defined by TCGA is enriched for both HER2 amplification and
    TP53 mutations.
- name: PIK3CA
  association: Potential Resistance Mechanism
  notes: >-
    PIK3CA mutations may co-occur with HER2 amplification and potentially contribute to
    resistance to HER2-targeted therapies through parallel PI3K pathway activation.
