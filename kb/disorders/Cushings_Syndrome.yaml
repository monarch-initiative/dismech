pathophysiology:
- name: Chronic Cortisol Excess
  description: >
    Cushing's syndrome results from prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids,
    either exogenous (iatrogenic from corticosteroid therapy) or endogenous (from
    pituitary adenomas secreting ACTH, adrenal tumors, or ectopic ACTH production).
    Elevated cortisol causes widespread metabolic, immunologic, and cardiovascular
    effects.

    snippet: "Cushing syndrome is defined as a prolonged increase in plasma cortisol levels that is not due to a physiological etiology."
    explanation: "This review confirms the fundamental pathophysiology of Cushing's syndrome as prolonged cortisol excess."

- name: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Dysregulation
  description: >
    In endogenous Cushing's, the normal negative feedback regulation of cortisol
    on the HPA axis is disrupted. ACTH-dependent forms involve autonomous ACTH
    secretion from pituitary or ectopic sources, while ACTH-independent forms
    involve autonomous adrenal cortisol production bypassing normal regulation.

  - reference: PMID:37432427
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Cushing disease, in which corticotropin excess is produced by a benign pituitary tumor, occurs in approximately 60% to 70% of patients with Cushing syndrome due to endogenous cortisol production."
    explanation: "This confirms that ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors are the most common cause of endogenous Cushing's, representing HPA axis dysregulation."
