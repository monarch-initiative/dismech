name: HER2-Positive Colorectal Cancer
description: >-
  HER2-positive colorectal cancer is a molecularly defined subtype characterized by ERBB2
  (HER2) amplification or overexpression, occurring in approximately 3-5% of metastatic
  colorectal cancers. HER2 amplification is enriched in RAS/BRAF wild-type tumors and
  represents an emerging actionable target. Unlike breast and gastric cancer, HER2-positive
  CRC responds modestly to single-agent HER2-targeted therapy, but combination approaches
  with HER2-directed agents and anti-EGFR therapy or dual HER2 blockade have shown promising
  activity. HER2 amplification may also be a mechanism of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR
  therapy.

pathophysiology:
- name: ERBB2 (HER2) Amplification and Overexpression
  description: >-
    ERBB2 gene amplification leads to overexpression of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase
    on the cell surface. Amplified HER2 forms homodimers and heterodimers with other ERBB
    family members (particularly HER3), leading to ligand-independent receptor activation
    and downstream signaling.

    description: HER2 signaling activates PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascade through HER3
- name: MAPK Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    HER2 receptor activation leads to recruitment of adaptor proteins (GRB2/SOS) that
    activate RAS, initiating the MAPK signaling cascade. This drives cell proliferation
    and survival. The MAPK pathway is a major effector of HER2 oncogenic signaling in
    colorectal cancer.

  - target: Enhanced Cell Proliferation
    description: MAPK signaling drives cell cycle progression
- name: PI3K-AKT Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    HER2 heterodimerization with HER3 is particularly potent at activating PI3K signaling
    because HER3 contains multiple PI3K binding sites. This leads to AKT activation,
    promoting cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. PI3K pathway activation may
    contribute to resistance to HER2-targeted therapy.

- name: Enhanced Cell Proliferation
  description: >-
    Combined MAPK and PI3K pathway activation drives enhanced cell proliferation through
    cyclin D1 induction and cell cycle progression. This leads to uncontrolled tumor
    growth dependent on HER2 signaling.

biochemical:
- name: HER2 Immunohistochemistry
  notes: >-
    IHC scoring uses the same criteria as gastric cancer (modified from breast cancer):
    0/1+ negative, 2+ equivocal requiring FISH confirmation, 3+ positive. Colorectal-specific
    scoring criteria have been proposed (HERACLES criteria) with stricter requirements.
- name: HER2 FISH/ISH
  notes: >-
    Fluorescence in situ hybridization or other in situ hybridization methods detect ERBB2
    gene amplification. HER2/CEP17 ratio greater than 2.0 or HER2 copy number greater than 6
    indicates amplification. Required for IHC 2+ cases.
- name: Next-Generation Sequencing
  notes: >-
    NGS can detect ERBB2 amplification through copy number analysis and may identify
    activating ERBB2 mutations as alternative mechanisms of HER2 pathway activation.
genetic:
- name: ERBB2 (HER2)
  association: Somatic Amplification
  notes: >-
    ERBB2 amplification occurs in 3-5% of metastatic CRC, enriched in RAS/BRAF wild-type
    tumors where it may represent 5-14%. Amplification is the primary mechanism, though
    activating mutations also occur rarely. Copy number correlates with response to
    HER2-targeted therapy.
- name: ERBB2 Activating Mutations
  association: Somatic Activating Mutation
  notes: >-
    Activating mutations in ERBB2 (e.g., S310F, L755S, V777L) occur in approximately 2%
    of CRC and may respond to HER2-targeted therapies. These are distinct from amplification
    and can co-occur with RAS mutations.
- name: RAS/BRAF Wild-Type
  association: Enrichment Context
  notes: >-
    HER2 amplification is strongly associated with RAS wild-type status and is typically
    mutually exclusive with BRAF V600E. This makes HER2-positive CRC a distinct molecular
    subgroup within RAS/BRAF wild-type tumors.
