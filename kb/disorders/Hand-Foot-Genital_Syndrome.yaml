name: Hand-Foot-Genital Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) is an autosomal dominant, fully penetrant
  disorder caused by mutations in HOXA13, a homeobox transcription factor critical
  for distal limb and Mullerian duct development. It is characterized by short first
  metacarpals, small distal phalanges of the thumbs, short middle phalanges of the
  fifth fingers, short great toes, and Mullerian duct fusion defects (bicornuate or
  didelphic uterus) in females. Males may have hypospadias. HFGS was the second
  human syndrome shown to be caused by a HOX gene mutation.

pathophysiology:
  - name: HOXA13 Loss-of-Function Disrupting Distal Limb and Mullerian Patterning
    description: >
      HOXA13 is a homeobox transcription factor that patterns distal limb structures
      and Mullerian duct derivatives. Loss-of-function mutations (nonsense, missense,
      or polyalanine expansions) disrupt DNA binding or protein function, leading to
      abnormal morphogenesis of distal limb elements and incomplete Mullerian duct
      fusion. Multiple mutation mechanisms have been identified, and mutations can
      produce more severe limb phenotypes than initially recognized.
