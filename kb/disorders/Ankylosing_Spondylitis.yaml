    label: ankylosing spondylitis
description: >-
  A chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the axial skeleton,
  characterized by sacroiliitis and progressive spinal fusion. Strongly
  associated with HLA-B27. Part of the spondyloarthritis spectrum including
  enthesitis and potential peripheral joint and extra-articular involvement.
pathophysiology:
- name: HLA-B27-Associated Immune Activation
  description: >-
    HLA-B27 misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum triggers the unfolded
    protein response and IL-23 production. Aberrant antigen presentation
    may also activate autoreactive T cells against joint antigens.

    snippet: >-
      The unfolded protein response (UPR) theory postulates that unconventional
      HLA-B27 variants homodimerize instead of heterodimerize; the misfolded
      proteins accumulate in the intracellular compartment triggering endoplasmic
      reticulum stress and increasing IL-23 production.
    explanation: >-
      Evidence supporting HLA-B27 misfolding mechanism that triggers ER stress
      and activates IL-23 production in ankylosing spondylitis.
- name: IL-23/IL-17 Axis Activation
  description: >-
    IL-23-driven expansion of Th17 cells and innate lymphoid cells produces
    IL-17, driving inflammation at entheses and in the spine. This pathway
    is a key therapeutic target.

      Well-established experimental data support the concept that IL-23/IL-17 axis
      activation contributes to the development of several inflammatory diseases, such
      as PsA, Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis; AS, Ankylosing Spondylitis; IBD,
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease; RA, Rheumatoid Arthritis; SS, Sjogren Syndrome; MS,
      Multiple Sclerosis.

      Review evidence confirming the central role of IL-23/IL-17 axis in
      ankylosing spondylitis pathogenesis and other autoimmune diseases.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      The fundamental role played by the IL-23/IL-17 axis comes from several lines
      of evidence depicting a clear increase in IL-23 and IL-17 levels in the sera
      of AS patients (113). This observation is coupled with the increased number of
      Th17 cells in peripheral blood from AS patients (114).
    explanation: >-
      Direct evidence of elevated IL-23 and IL-17 levels and increased Th17 cells
      in ankylosing spondylitis patients.
- name: Enthesitis and New Bone Formation
  description: >-
    Inflammation at entheses (tendon/ligament insertions) leads to erosion
    followed by aberrant bone formation. Syndesmophytes and ankylosis result
    from dysregulated osteoblast activity driven by Wnt and BMP signaling.

    snippet: >-
      The strongest genetic association is with the allele human leukocyte antigen
      B27 (HLA-B27) of the Major Histocompatibility Complex-I (MHC-I) gene, located
      on chromosome 6 (98).

    snippet: >-
      In particular, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for
      aminopeptidases expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as ERAP1
      and ERAP2, were identified in the past decade. These proteins trim peptides
      in the ER so that these molecules get to the right length, usually between
      8 and 10 amino acids, to be presented by MHC-I molecules (107).
    explanation: >-
      Evidence that ERAP1 genetic variants are associated with ankylosing
      spondylitis through effects on antigen processing and MHC-I presentation.

    snippet: >-
      SNPs directly affecting the IL-23/IL-17 axis were described in AS and further
      stress the importance of this pathway. The most relevant are located in the
      genes coding for IL-23R and STAT3 and TYK2, which are downstream targets of
      IL-23 signaling (110, 111).
    explanation: >-
      Evidence that IL23R variants are associated with ankylosing spondylitis,
      highlighting the importance of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway.
