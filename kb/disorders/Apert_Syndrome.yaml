name: Apert Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Apert syndrome is a severe craniosynostosis syndrome caused by heterozygous gain-of-function
  mutations in FGFR2, characterized by coronal craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and
  symmetric syndactyly of the hands and feet (mitten hands/sock feet). It is one of the most
  clinically recognizable craniosynostosis syndromes due to the distinctive combination of
  skull and limb abnormalities. Two specific mutations (S252W and P253R) account for nearly
  all cases and are associated with ligand-independent receptor activation.

inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
    description: >
      Autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance. Most cases arise from
      de novo mutations, with advanced paternal age as a risk factor due to selective
      advantage of mutant spermatogonial cells.
pathophysiology:
  - name: FGFR2 Gain-of-Function Signaling
    description: >
      The S252W and P253R mutations in FGFR2 alter ligand binding specificity, allowing
      aberrant activation by non-cognate FGF ligands. This leads to enhanced and prolonged
      receptor signaling, causing premature fusion of cranial sutures and abnormal limb
      development. The mutations affect the linker region between immunoglobulin-like
      domains II and III, altering ligand-receptor interactions.

  - name: Premature Suture Fusion
    description: >
      Enhanced FGFR2 signaling in cranial suture mesenchyme promotes premature
      osteogenic differentiation and fusion of the coronal sutures, restricting
      skull growth perpendicular to the fused sutures and causing characteristic
      turricephaly (tower skull).

          and mineralization compared to wild-type FGFR2, explaining premature suture fusion.
  - name: ERK1/2 and PKCα Pathway Dysregulation
    description: >
      The Apert S252W mutation activates distinct downstream signaling pathways compared
      to wild-type FGFR2. While wild-type FGFR2 signals primarily through ERK1/2, the
      mutant receptor additionally activates protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), which mediates
      the enhanced osteogenic differentiation characteristic of Apert syndrome.

  - name: FGFR2 Mutations
    association: Causative
    notes: >
      Two adjacent mutations in FGFR2 exon 7 account for nearly all cases:
      S252W (c.755C>G) in ~65% and P253R (c.758C>G) in ~32%. Both affect the
      linker region between Ig-II and Ig-III domains. The S252W mutation is
      associated with more severe craniofacial features; P253R with more
      severe syndactyly.
