    snippet: Early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) is defined as having an age of onset
      younger than 65 years. ... Early-onset AD comprises about 5% to 6% of cases
      of AD and includes a substantial percentage of phenotypic variants that differ
      from the usual amnestic presentation of typical AD. Characteristics of early-onset
      AD in comparison to late-onset AD include a larger genetic predisposition (familial
      mutations and summed polygenic risk)

      blocked by an AD drug, memantine, an NMDAR antagonist that selectively blocks
      the function of extrasynaptic NMDARs.
    explanation: This abstract highlights that memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist,
      helps in blocking the negative effects of excessive NMDAR activity in Alzheimer's
      Disease.

    snippet: The hypothesis proposed is restoration of medium spiny neurons in Huntington's
      disease using neural progenitor cell implantation and attenuation of glutamate
      mediated excitotoxicity using a partial glutamate antagonist - Memantine. Memantine
      can block the NMDA receptors and will prevent excess calcium influx into the
      neurons decreases the vulnerability of medium spiny neurons to glutamate mediated
      excitotoxicity.
    explanation: Although primarily discussing Huntington's Disease, this abstract
      supports the idea that memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, regulates glutamate
      activity, which is relevant to Alzheimer's Disease treatment.

      maintaining daily functioning, which is related to cognitive function, but does
      not directly address cognitive maintenance alone.
