  Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis type 2 (ARO2) is a severe sclerosing bone
  disease caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in TCIRG1, encoding the
  osteoclast-specific a3 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase. TCIRG1 mutations are
  the most frequent cause of infantile malignant osteopetrosis, accounting for over
  50% of ARO cases. Osteoclasts are present in normal or elevated numbers but are
  non-functional due to inability to acidify the resorption lacuna. The disease is
  characterized by dense but brittle bones, bone marrow failure, cranial nerve
  compression, and hepatosplenomegaly. Without hematopoietic stem cell
  transplantation, the disease is fatal within the first decade of life.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Vacuolar Proton Pump Deficiency in Osteoclasts
    description: >
      TCIRG1 encodes the a3 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase),
      which is specifically expressed in osteoclasts and essential for proton
      secretion into the resorption lacuna. Loss-of-function mutations abolish
      osteoclast acidification capacity, preventing dissolution of hydroxyapatite
      mineral in bone matrix. Osteoclasts differentiate normally and are present
      in normal or elevated numbers but cannot resorb bone.
