category: Mendelian
description: >
  Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), also known as infantile malignant
  osteopetrosis, is a severe bone disease with a fatal outcome generally within
  the first decade of life if untreated. TCIRG1 mutations (encoding the osteoclast-
  specific 116-kD subunit of the vacuolar proton pump) are the most frequent cause,
  accounting for over 50% of cases. Osteoclasts are present in normal or elevated
  numbers but are non-functional due to inability to acidify the resorption lacuna.
  The disease is characterized by dense but brittle bones, bone marrow failure,
  cranial nerve compression, and hepatosplenomegaly. Hematopoietic stem cell
  transplantation is the only curative treatment.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Vacuolar Proton Pump Deficiency in Osteoclasts
    description: >
      TCIRG1 encodes the a3 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase),
      which is specifically expressed in osteoclasts and essential for proton
      secretion into the resorption lacuna. Loss-of-function mutations abolish
      osteoclast acidification capacity, preventing dissolution of hydroxyapatite
      mineral in bone matrix. Osteoclasts differentiate normally and are present
      in normal or elevated numbers but cannot resorb bone, leading to failure of
      bone remodeling, progressive skeletal sclerosis, and bone marrow failure
      from obliteration of the medullary cavity.
