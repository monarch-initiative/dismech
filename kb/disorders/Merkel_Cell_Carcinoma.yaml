name: Merkel Cell Carcinoma
description: >-
  Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the
  skin arising from Merkel cells, specialized mechanoreceptor cells in the basal
  epidermis. MCC has two distinct etiologies: approximately 80% of cases are caused
  by clonal integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) with expression of viral
  T antigens, while the remaining 20% are virus-negative and driven by UV-induced
  mutations resulting in high tumor mutational burden. MCC is highly aggressive with
  significant metastatic potential, but also immunogenic. Immune checkpoint inhibitors
  (avelumab, pembrolizumab) have transformed treatment of advanced MCC, with response
  rates of 50-70% and durable responses in many patients.

has_subtypes:
- name: MCPyV-Positive Merkel Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Virus-driven MCC containing clonally integrated Merkel cell polyomavirus
    with expression of viral T antigens (small T and truncated large T antigens).
    Accounts for approximately 80% of MCC cases. Generally has lower tumor
    mutational burden than virus-negative MCC.
- name: MCPyV-Negative Merkel Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    UV-induced MCC lacking viral integration. Characterized by high tumor
    mutational burden with UV signature mutations, including frequent RB1
    inactivation. Accounts for approximately 20% of MCC cases.
infectious_agent:
- name: Merkel Cell Polyomavirus
  description: >-
    MCPyV is a small DNA virus that clonally integrates into the host genome in
    approximately 80% of MCC cases. The virus expresses small T antigen (which
    promotes cell proliferation) and a truncated large T antigen (which retains
    RB1 binding but loses replication capacity). Viral T antigens drive
    tumorigenesis and are essential for tumor maintenance.

pathophysiology:
- name: Viral T Antigen Oncogenesis
  description: >-
    In MCPyV-positive MCC, clonally integrated virus expresses truncated large
    T antigen (LT) that binds and inactivates RB tumor suppressor protein,
    releasing E2F transcription factors and driving cell cycle progression.
    Small T antigen (sT) promotes proliferation through multiple mechanisms
    including 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation and cap-dependent translation.

  description: >-
    In virus-positive MCC, viral large T antigen binds and inactivates RB1 protein.
    In virus-negative MCC, RB1 is frequently inactivated by somatic mutations.
    In both cases, loss of RB1 function releases E2F transcription factors to
    drive cell cycle progression and proliferation.

    In virus-negative MCC (approximately 20%), high levels of UV-induced mutations
    (C>T transitions at dipyrimidine sites) drive oncogenesis. These tumors have
    among the highest tumor mutational burdens of any cancer and frequently
    harbor mutations in TP53, RB1, and other tumor suppressors.

environmental:
- name: Ultraviolet Radiation
  description: >-
    UV exposure is a major risk factor for MCC. Most tumors occur on sun-exposed
    skin. UV signature mutations are characteristic of virus-negative MCC.
- name: Immunosuppression
  description: >-
    Immunosuppression dramatically increases MCC risk (10-15 fold in organ
    transplant recipients). This suggests immune surveillance normally
    controls MCPyV-infected cells.
genetic:
- name: MCPyV T Antigens
  association: Viral Oncogenes
  notes: >-
    In MCPyV-positive MCC, viral small T and truncated large T antigens are
    the primary oncogenic drivers. Large T antigen binds RB1, while small T
    antigen promotes proliferation through multiple mechanisms. Tumors are
    addicted to viral oncoprotein expression.
- name: RB1
  association: Somatic Mutations (in MCPyV-negative MCC)
  notes: >-
    RB1 mutations occur in the majority of MCPyV-negative MCC but are
    virtually absent in virus-positive tumors, where viral LT antigen
    functionally inactivates RB1 protein.
- name: TP53
  association: Somatic Mutations (in MCPyV-negative MCC)
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations with UV signature are common in virus-negative MCC.
    Virus-positive tumors retain wild-type TP53, suggesting different
    selective pressures.
treatments:

  description: >-
    Anti-PD-L1 antibody approved for metastatic MCC. First immune checkpoint
    inhibitor approved for MCC based on durable responses in the JAVELIN Merkel

    patients and higher in first-line setting.

    Wide local excision with adequate margins (1-2 cm) is the primary treatment
    for localized MCC. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended given high
    rate of occult nodal metastases.

- name: Radiation Therapy
  description: >-
    MCC is radiosensitive. Adjuvant radiation improves local control,
    particularly for tumors with high-risk features. Radiation may be used
    as primary treatment for unresectable tumors.

- name: Chemotherapy
  description: >-
    MCC is chemosensitive (like other small cell carcinomas) with initial
    response rates of 50-60% to platinum/etoposide regimens. However,
    responses are typically short-lived and chemotherapy has been largely
    supplanted by immunotherapy.

    label: cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma
notes: >-
  MCC is a paradigm for both viral oncogenesis and immunotherapy responsiveness.
  The dual etiology (viral versus UV-induced) highlights different mechanisms
  leading to the same tumor type. The high immunogenicity of MCC, whether due
  to viral antigens or high mutational burden, underlies the remarkable
  responses to checkpoint inhibitors. Viral T antigens represent potential
  targets for T-cell based therapies. The association with immunosuppression
  underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling this tumor.
