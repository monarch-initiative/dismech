name: Glioblastoma, IDH-Wildtype
description: >-
  Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, is the most common and aggressive primary malignant
  brain tumor in adults. Under WHO 2021 classification, this molecularly defined
  entity requires absence of IDH1/2 mutations and presence of at least one of three
  molecular features: TERT promoter mutation, EGFR amplification, or combined gain
  of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10 (+7/-10). These tumors are characterized
  by rapid growth, extensive infiltration, florid microvascular proliferation, and
  necrosis. Despite multimodal therapy, prognosis remains poor with median survival
  of 14-16 months. Key molecular alterations include TERT promoter mutations (80%),
  EGFR amplification (40-50%), PTEN loss, and homozygous CDKN2A deletion.

has_subtypes:
- name: Giant Cell Glioblastoma
  description: >-
    Histological variant characterized by numerous bizarre multinucleated giant cells.
    May have slightly better prognosis than conventional glioblastoma. Often shows
    TP53 mutations.
- name: Gliosarcoma
  description: >-
    Variant with biphasic pattern showing areas of glial differentiation and
    malignant mesenchymal (sarcomatous) component. Similar prognosis to conventional
    glioblastoma. Sarcomatous component often shows divergent molecular features.
- name: Epithelioid Glioblastoma
  description: >-
    Aggressive variant with epithelioid morphology, frequent BRAF V600E mutations,
    and loss of INI1 expression. Often occurs in younger patients and may have
    worse prognosis than conventional glioblastoma.
pathophysiology:
- name: TERT Promoter Activation
  description: >-
    TERT promoter mutations (C228T or C250T) occur in approximately 80% of
    IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. These mutations create de novo ETS transcription
    factor binding sites, leading to TERT upregulation and telomerase reactivation.
    This enables unlimited replicative potential and is a defining molecular feature.

  description: >-
    Combined gain of chromosome 7 (+7) and loss of chromosome 10 (-10) is a
    defining molecular feature of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, present in over 90%
    of cases. Chromosome 7 gain amplifies EGFR and MET. Chromosome 10 loss deletes
    PTEN and other tumor suppressors.

  description: >-
    EGFR is amplified in 40-50% and MET in 5% of glioblastomas. EGFR amplification
    is often accompanied by EGFRvIII, a constitutively active deletion variant
    lacking exons 2-7. These alterations drive proliferation through RAS/RAF/MAPK
    and PI3K/AKT pathways.
