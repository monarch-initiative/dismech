  Nemaline myopathy (also called nemaline rod myopathy) is a group of congenital
  myopathies characterized by the presence of rod-shaped structures (nemaline bodies
  or rods) in skeletal muscle fibers on biopsy. It is the most common non-dystrophic
  congenital myopathy, affecting approximately 1 in 50,000 live births. Clinical
  features range from severe neonatal forms with respiratory failure to mild
  childhood-onset or adult-onset forms with proximal weakness. The disease is
  genetically heterogeneous, with mutations in at least 13 genes encoding components
  of the thin filament or associated proteins, most commonly NEB and ACTA1.

pathophysiology:
- name: Thin Filament Dysfunction
  description: >
    Mutations in genes encoding thin filament components (nebulin, skeletal alpha-actin,
    tropomyosins, troponins, cofilin-2, leiomodin-3) disrupt the normal structure
    and function of the sarcomeric thin filament. This leads to impaired actin-myosin
    cross-bridge cycling and reduced muscle force generation.

    Nemaline rods are electron-dense inclusions composed of alpha-actinin, actin,

    In inherited NM, rods are typically found in subsarcolemmal or central aggregates.
    Rod shape in KLHL40 and LMOD3 cases is distinctive. The number and distribution
    of rods does not correlate with severity or prognosis. In severe ACTA1 cases,
    intranuclear rods and cytoplasmic bodies are characteristic.

- name: Thin Filament Length Dysregulation
  description: >
    Nebulin acts as a molecular ruler specifying thin filament length. Loss of
    nebulin leads to shorter thin filaments, reducing the overlap zone with thick
    filaments and impairing force generation. Pathogenic NEB duplications can also
    produce longer-than-normal thin filaments, demonstrating that uniformity in
    thin filament length is critical and both shortened and elongated filaments
    are deleterious.

- name: Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway Dysregulation (KLHL40)
  description: >
    KLHL40 functions as a CUL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-specific adapter.
    Loss of KLHL40 disrupts ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SAR1A, leading to
    defective ER-to-Golgi vesicle trafficking, impaired extracellular matrix protein
    secretion, and downstream structural and functional abnormalities in skeletal
    muscle.

    myopathy, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Most are compound
    heterozygous mutations. Nebulin is a giant sarcomeric protein that spans
    the thin filament and regulates its length.
