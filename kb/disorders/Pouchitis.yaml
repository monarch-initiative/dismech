pathophysiology:
- name: Bacterial Dysbiosis
  description: >
    Altered gut microbiome composition in the ileal pouch, with decreased microbial
    diversity and shifts toward pathogenic bacterial species. The pouch environment
    lacks normal colonic bacteria and experiences reduced butyrate-producing bacteria,
    leading to an imbalanced microbial ecosystem that triggers inflammation.

    snippet: >
      there is evidence that a dysbiosis characterized by decreased gut microbiota
      diversity in UC-IPAA patients may, in genetically predisposed subjects, lead to
      aberrant mucosal immune regulation triggering an inflammatory process.
    explanation: >
      Review confirming that microbiome dysbiosis with decreased diversity is central to pouchitis
      pathogenesis, leading to aberrant immune regulation and inflammation.
- name: Mucosal Immune Dysregulation
  description: >
    Chronic inflammation of the ileal pouch mucosa characterized by increased
    pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8),
    enhanced neutrophil infiltration, and impaired epithelial barrier function.
    The adaptive immune response shows increased Th1 and Th17 cell activity.

    Disruption of tight junction proteins and increased intestinal permeability
    in the pouch mucosa, allowing bacterial translocation and antigenic stimulation

      In patients with UC with pouchitis, epithelial
      expression of ZO-1 and claudin 1 were reduced
    explanation: >
      Demonstrates reduced expression of barrier-forming tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and claudin-1)
      in pouchitis, directly supporting epithelial barrier dysfunction as a pathogenic mechanism.
  - reference: PMID:25222658
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >
      Increased epithelial expression of the "pore-forming" TJP claudin 2,
      and DC expression of gut-homing markers CCR 9 and integrin β7, occurred early
      after ileostomy closure.
    explanation: >
      Shows early upregulation of claudin-2, a pore-forming protein that increases permeability,
      indicating that barrier dysfunction may be an initiating event in pouchitis development.
- name: NOD2 Genetic Susceptibility
  description: >
    Genetic polymorphisms in NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
    protein 2), particularly the NOD2insC variant (rs2066847), are strongly associated
    with increased risk of chronic pouchitis and Crohn's disease-like pouch phenotypes.
    NOD2 normally functions as an intracellular bacterial sensor that regulates autophagy
    and antimicrobial responses; loss-of-function variants impair bacterial clearance
    and increase susceptibility to inflammation.

      The NOD2insC (rs2066847) risk variant was
      the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) most significantly associated with
      pouch outcome (p=7.4×10(-5)). Specifically, it was associated with both CP and
      CDL in comparison with NCP (OR=3.2 and 4.3, respectively).
    explanation: >

      genetic risk factor for chronic pouchitis (OR=3.2) and Crohn's-like disease of the pouch (OR=4.3).
