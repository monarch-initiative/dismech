    label: Behcet disease
description: >-
  A systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral and genital
  ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. Involves both arterial and venous vessels
  of all sizes. Highly prevalent along the ancient Silk Road. Classified as a
  variable vessel vasculitis with autoinflammatory features.
pathophysiology:
- name: HLA-B51-Associated Immune Dysregulation
  description: >-
    Strong association with HLA-B51. Aberrant peptide presentation and
    cross-reactivity with microbial antigens may trigger autoinflammatory
    responses. ERAP1 variants affect peptide processing for HLA-B51.

    snippet: >-
      genetic factors (such as HLA-B51), dysregulated immune responses of both
      the innate and adaptive immune systems, infections (such as streptococcus),
      and environmental factors (such as GDP) are all involved in its development.
    explanation: >-
      This review confirms that HLA-B51 is a key genetic factor in Behcet's
      disease pathogenesis, supporting the role of aberrant antigen presentation
      in disease development.
- name: Neutrophil Hyperactivation
  description: >-
    Neutrophils show enhanced chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and oxidative burst.
    Pathergy response (exaggerated skin reaction to minor trauma) reflects
    neutrophil hyperreactivity. NETs may contribute to vascular damage.

    snippet: >-
      Innate immunity, including hyperactivity of neutrophils and γδT cells and
      elevated NK1/NK2 ratios, has been shown to play an essential role in this
      disease.
    explanation: >-
      This review highlights neutrophil hyperactivity as a key feature of
      innate immune dysregulation in Behcet's uveitis, supporting the role of
      neutrophil activation in pathogenesis.

    snippet: >-
      Skin histopathology demonstrates the overactivation of innate immunity,
      such as neutrophilic dermatitis/panniculitis, in patients with BD.
    explanation: >-
      Histopathological evidence confirms neutrophil overactivation in Behcet's
      disease skin lesions, demonstrating the pathologic role of neutrophils in
      tissue inflammation.
- name: Th1/Th17 Cytokine Imbalance
  description: >-
    Elevated IL-17, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha drive tissue inflammation.
    IL-23/IL-17 axis is particularly important and represents a therapeutic
    target.

      Adaptive immune system disturbance, including homeostatic perturbations,
      Th1, Th17 overaction, and Treg cell dysfunction, is thought to be involved
      in BU pathogenesis.
    explanation: >-
      This review describes the imbalance between pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17
      responses and regulatory T cell dysfunction as central to Behcet's uveitis
      pathogenesis, supporting the role of cytokine imbalance in disease
      progression.

      Behcet's uveitis (BU) is a common manifestation of BD, occurring in over
      two-thirds of the patients. BU is characterized by bilateral, chronic,
      recurrent, non-granulomatous uveitis in association with complications
      such as retinal ischemia and atrophy, optic atrophy, macular ischemia,
      macular edema, and further neovascular complications (vitreous hemorrhage,
      neovascular glaucoma).
