description: 'Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of fatty acid oxidation caused by loss-of-function
  variants in SLC22A5, encoding the high-affinity sodium-dependent carnitine transporter OCTN2. Defective OCTN2 leads to impaired
  cellular uptake and renal tubular reabsorption of carnitine, causing systemic carnitine depletion and impaired mitochondrial
  long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation. The clinical spectrum is bimodal, with acute metabolic decompensation in infancy (hypoketotic
  hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, hepatic encephalopathy) and a more insidious cardiomyopathy phenotype (dilated or hypertrophic)
  often accompanied by skeletal myopathy. PCD is treatable with lifelong oral L-carnitine supplementation, which can reverse
  cardiomyopathy if started early. Estimated prevalence is approximately 1 in 20,000 in Chinese populations, with regional
  and ethnic variation.

parents:
- Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorder
- Inborn Error of Metabolism
prevalence:
- notes: Meta-analysis of Chinese NBS data estimated prevalence of 1/20,000, with higher incidence in southern China (0.07
    per mille) than northern China (0.02 per mille). China Neonatal Genomes Project estimated prevalence of approximately
    1:17,456. Prevalence varies by ethnicity and region. In Hong Kong expanded NBS, carnitine uptake defect was the most common
    IMD identified (9 of 47 total IMD cases).
progression:
- notes: Disease progression proceeds from inherited biallelic SLC22A5 variants through systemic carnitine depletion, impaired
    fatty acid oxidation, and energy failure. In the acute metabolic form, fasting or illness precipitates hypoketotic hypoglycemia,
    hyperammonemia, and encephalopathy. In the cardiac form, chronic energy deficit leads to cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction,
    fibrosis via GAS6/AXL and SPP1-driven macrophage-fibroblast signaling, and progressive cardiomyopathy with arrhythmia
    risk and possible sudden death. Discontinuation of carnitine supplementation can precipitate fatal outcomes.
pathophysiology:
- name: Defective carnitine transport and systemic depletion
  description: 'Loss-of-function variants in SLC22A5 impair OCTN2-mediated carnitine uptake from blood, gut, and renal tubules.
    Defective renal tubular reabsorption causes urinary carnitine wasting, producing low plasma free carnitine and tissue
    carnitine depletion. This is the primary upstream defect driving all downstream metabolic consequences.

      dysfunction, treatment with carnitine replacement therapy is recommended.
    explanation: Supports carnitine replacement as treatment during acute episodes.

  description: 'NBS for PCD uses tandem mass spectrometry to measure free carnitine (C0) in dried blood spots. The condition
    is of high screening complexity due to pitfalls including maternal PCD, premature birth, and medication effects on C0
    levels. Second-tier NGS testing can improve positive predictive value from approximately 5% to 20%.

  description: 'Standard heart failure therapy including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics may be required for
    patients presenting with cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Cardiac monitoring with echocardiography is essential for long-term

    explanation: Directly supports acetyl-L-carnitine as treatment for carnitine-associated encephalopathy.
notes: 'PCD is considered one of the most treatable inborn errors of metabolism, with cardiomyopathy often fully reversible
  if diagnosed and treated early. However, discontinuation of L-carnitine supplementation can be fatal, with reports of sudden
  death when supplementation was stopped. NBS programs are expanding worldwide but face challenges with false positives due
  to maternal PCD, premature birth, and medication effects. Side effects of high-dose carnitine include diarrhea and fishy
  body odor (trimethylamine). The 2024 single-nucleus RNA-seq study of OCTN2-deficient hearts provides new mechanistic insights
  into cardiomyopathy progression through fibrosis pathways.
