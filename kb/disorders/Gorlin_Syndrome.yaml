name: Gorlin Syndrome
description: >-
  Gorlin syndrome (nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, NBCCS) is an autosomal dominant
  hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome caused primarily by germline mutations in PTCH1,
  a tumor suppressor gene encoding the Hedgehog pathway receptor Patched 1. The syndrome is
  characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas (often appearing in childhood or adolescence),
  odontogenic keratocysts of the jaw, palmar and plantar pits, skeletal abnormalities, and
  increased risk of medulloblastoma. Constitutive activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway
  underlies the major manifestations. Management includes surveillance for early detection
  of malignancies, surgical removal of tumors, and Hedgehog pathway inhibitors for advanced
  basal cell carcinomas.

    explanation: Documents autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance.
pathophysiology:
- name: PTCH1 Germline Mutations
  description: >-
    PTCH1 encodes Patched 1, a 12-pass transmembrane receptor that normally suppresses
    Smoothened (SMO) in the absence of Hedgehog ligand. Germline heterozygous loss-of-function
    mutations in PTCH1 predispose to tumors following Knudson's two-hit model. Loss of the
    remaining wild-type allele in somatic cells leads to constitutive Hedgehog pathway
    activation and tumor development.

  description: >-
    A minority of Gorlin syndrome cases (approximately 5%) are caused by germline
    mutations in SUFU (Suppressor of Fused), which encodes a negative regulator of
    GLI transcription factors. SUFU mutations are associated with markedly higher risk of
    medulloblastoma (up to 20-fold higher) compared to PTCH1 mutations, with tumors typically
    occurring before age 3 years.

notes: >-
  Gorlin syndrome represents a paradigm for understanding Hedgehog pathway biology and
  cancer predisposition. The syndrome demonstrates the critical role of the Hedgehog
  pathway in development (explaining skeletal and craniofacial features) and in tumor
  suppression. Recognition is important due to radiation sensitivity and availability
  of targeted therapy with Hedgehog pathway inhibitors.
