pathophysiology:
  - name: RBM10-mediated alternative splicing dysregulation
    description: >-
      Loss-of-function mutations in RBM10 (RNA Binding Motif Protein 10) impair its role as a U2-associated
      splicing repressor, leading to widespread dysregulation of alternative splicing across the transcriptome.
      RBM10 normally promotes cassette exon skipping through interaction with U2 snRNP at intron branch sites
      on chromatin. Loss of RBM10 function shifts hundreds to thousands of splicing events toward exon inclusion.
      Key downstream effects include NOTCH pathway de-repression via NUMB missplicing and dysregulation of
      extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal signaling through isoform changes in VCL, CD44, and TNC. These
      splicing defects disrupt developmental pathways controlling craniofacial morphogenesis, limb patterning,
      and cardiac development, leading to the characteristic TARP phenotype.

      RBM10 also functions in a splicing-independent manner at DNA replication forks, where it recruits

notes: |
  TARP syndrome (Talipes equinovarus, Atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, Persistence of left superior vena cava)
  is a rare X-linked developmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in RBM10 (RNA Binding Motif Protein 10),
  an essential splicing regulator. The disorder is characterized by a distinctive constellation of congenital abnormalities
  and has historically shown high neonatal mortality, though survival beyond infancy is possible with certain variant types
  (particularly splice-site mutations).

  The cardinal features of TARP syndrome include Robin sequence (micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate),
  atrial septal defect, persistence of the left superior vena cava, and talipes equinovarus. The phenotype is variable,
  with some patients presenting additional dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism and ear abnormalities, while others
  may present with syndactyly, polydactyly, or brain anomalies including cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, ventriculomegaly,
  and corpus callosum thinning. Rare hepatic manifestations including neonatal cholestasis with elevated alpha-fetoprotein
  have been documented in survival cases. Rare gastrointestinal complications including vitelline vascular remnants causing
  intestinal obstruction have also been reported in TARP patients. Additional rare manifestations include renal malformations
  (horseshoe kidney) and ophthalmic involvement (optic nerve atrophy), indicating the broad multisystem nature of this disorder.

  The molecular basis of TARP syndrome involves loss-of-function mutations in RBM10 on chromosome Xp11.23. RBM10 functions
  as a U2-associated splicing repressor that promotes cassette exon skipping through interaction with U2 snRNP at intron
  branch sites on chromatin. Loss of RBM10 function shifts hundreds to thousands of splicing events toward exon inclusion,
  with severity of clinical phenotype correlating with the extent of functional impairment. Key downstream effects include:
  (1) NOTCH pathway de-repression via NUMB missplicing, disrupting cell-fate decisions in craniofacial and cardiac progenitors;
  (2) dysregulation of extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal signaling through isoform changes in VCL, CD44, and TNC,
  impairing cell migration and morphogenesis; and (3) splicing-independent replication fork dysfunction through HDAC1
  recruitment, adding proliferative stress.

  The lethality and severity of TARP syndrome reflect the critical role of RBM10-regulated splicing in embryonic development.
  The multisystem involvement affects tissues derived from mesoderm (cardiac, limb) and neural crest (craniofacial), consistent
  with widespread splicing dysregulation during early embryogenesis.

  Diagnostic approach includes RBM10 sequencing in male infants with Robin sequence plus cardiac/limb anomalies, with RNA studies
  to confirm splice impacts where splice-site variants are suspected. Prenatal diagnosis is possible through molecular genetic
  testing and prenatal ultrasound evaluation showing cardiac defects, cleft palate, and increased nuchal thickness. Genetic counseling
  is essential for families affected by TARP syndrome due to the X-linked recessive inheritance pattern and high recurrence risk.
