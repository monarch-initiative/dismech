    label: circadian rhythm sleep disorder, delayed sleep phase type
description: >-
  Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), also known as delayed sleep-wake phase
  disorder (DSWPD), is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder characterized by a
  persistent and significant delay of the major sleep episode relative to the
  desired clock time. Affected individuals typically cannot fall asleep until
  well past midnight (often 2-6 AM) and, if unrestricted, sleep normally in
  duration and quality but at a delayed schedule. When forced to adhere to
  conventional schedules, patients experience chronic sleep deprivation, excessive
  daytime sleepiness, and difficulty with morning awakening. The disorder has a
  strong genetic component involving circadian clock genes, with onset
  predominantly in adolescence. A familial form caused by gain-of-function
  CRY1 mutations follows autosomal dominant inheritance.

- name: Circadian-Delayed DSWPD
  description: >-
    The majority subtype (~60% of cases) characterized by objectively delayed
    circadian phase markers, including delayed dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)
    and core body temperature minimum. These patients have a true delay of the
    endogenous circadian pacemaker relative to the light-dark cycle.

      such as truancy and academic or social troubles, are largely involved in
      the mechanism of this disorder.

      By stating that ~40% of DSWPD cases have normal circadian markers, this

      subtype.

  description: >-

pathophysiology:
- name: Circadian Clock Gene Polymorphisms
  description: >-
    Variants in core circadian clock genes alter the molecular oscillator that
    drives the sleep-wake cycle. The circadian clock operates via transcription-
    translation feedback loops involving CLOCK, BMAL1, PER, and CRY gene
    families. A gain-of-function mutation in CRY1 (c.1657+3A>C) creates a
    transcriptional inhibitor with enhanced affinity for Clock and Bmal1,
    lengthening the circadian period by approximately 30 minutes. Additional
    polymorphisms in PER3 and CLOCK contribute to DSPS susceptibility.

  description: >-
    DSPS patients exhibit a delayed dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), reflecting
    a shifted circadian pacemaker. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) signal to
    the pineal gland for melatonin synthesis is phase-delayed, resulting in later
    endogenous melatonin rise and consequently delayed sleep propensity. This
    delay in melatonin secretion is a hallmark biomarker of the condition.
    However, approximately 40% of DSWPD cases may have normal melatonin timing,
    suggesting heterogeneity in the underlying mechanism.

- name: Chronotherapy
  description: >-
    Progressive delay of sleep times around the clock until the desired
    bedtime is reached. This approach exploits the natural tendency toward
    phase delay but requires strict schedule adherence and is difficult
    to maintain long-term.
  notes: >-
    The AASM 2015 guideline did not provide a recommendation for or against
    chronotherapy for DSWPD due to insufficient evidence. No specific MAXO
    term exists for chronotherapy.

    explanation: >-
      The AASM guideline could not provide recommendations for chronotherapy
      in DSWPD due to insufficient evidence, reflecting the limited data

  description: >-
    A dual MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor agonist under investigation for DSWPD.
    Clinical trials include evaluation in the general DSWPD population and

    resolution in a DSWPD patient treated with tasimelteon.

      The participant was enrolled in an 11-month Open-Label Extension (OLE)

      treated with tasimelteon. DSWPD symptoms were resolved, and their
      previously delayed sleep-wake cycle was advanced.
    explanation: >-
      Case report demonstrating successful resolution of DSWPD symptoms with
      tasimelteon treatment, with advancement of the previously delayed
      sleep-wake cycle.
- name: Cognitive-Behavioral Interventions
  description: >-
    Behavioral approaches including sleep hygiene education, stimulus control,
    and cognitive therapy for insomnia-related cognitions. Particularly
    relevant for the circadian-entrained DSWPD subtype where psychological
    and behavioral factors play a larger role.

      future studies should address the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral
      approaches in addition to chronobiological approaches in the treatment
      of DSWPD.
    explanation: >-
      Highlights the need for cognitive-behavioral interventions as adjuncts
      to chronobiological treatments, particularly given the circadian-entrained
      subtype where behavioral factors predominate.

      Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD), which is characterized by a
      persistent and intractable delay of sleep onset and offset times relative
