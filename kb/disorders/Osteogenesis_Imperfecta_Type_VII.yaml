description: >
  Osteogenesis imperfecta type VII is a severe autosomal recessive form of OI
  caused by biallelic mutations in CRTAP (cartilage-associated protein). CRTAP
  forms a complex with P3H1 (LEPRE1) and cyclophilin B (PPIB) that catalyzes
  3-hydroxylation of a specific proline residue in type I collagen, essential
  for proper collagen folding and stability. Loss of CRTAP function impairs
  collagen modification, leading to severe bone fragility resembling types II/III
  OI but with distinctive features including rhizomelia and white sclerae.

    Autosomal recessive inheritance. Carrier parents are unaffected.
    More common in populations with high consanguinity rates.
pathophysiology:
- name: Collagen 3-Hydroxylation Deficiency
  description: >
    CRTAP is a component of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex that modifies
    Pro986 in the alpha1(I) chain of type I collagen. Loss of this modification
    delays collagen folding, causing overmodification of the helix and altered
    collagen structure and cross-linking.

    snippet: >-
      CRTAP can form a complex with P3H1 and cyclophilin B (CYPB), and Crtap-/-
      bone and cartilage collagens show decreased prolyl 3-hydroxylation. Moreover,
      mutant collagen shows evidence of overmodification, and collagen fibrils in
      mutant skin have increased diameter consistent with altered fibrillogenesis.

      and showing that loss leads to collagen overmodification and abnormal fibrils.

  notes: >
    Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CRTAP cause type VII OI. A
    common founder mutation (IVS1+1G>A) is found in West African populations.
    The severity of the phenotype correlates with the residual CRTAP function.

    snippet: >-
      In humans, CRTAP mutations are associated with the clinical spectrum of
      recessive osteogenesis imperfecta, including the type II and VII forms.
      Hence, dysregulation of prolyl 3-hydroxylation is a mechanism for connective
      tissue disease.

      establishing a new mechanism for OI distinct from collagen structural mutations.
