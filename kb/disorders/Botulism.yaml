    label: botulism
description: >-
  Botulism is a neuroparalytic illness caused by botulinum toxin exposure.
pathophysiology:
- name: Botulinum Neurotoxin-Mediated Neuromuscular Blockade
  description: >-
    Botulinum toxin causes neuroparalysis by disrupting neuromuscular function,
    resulting in descending paralysis.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:31157190
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Botulism is rare neuroparalytic disease caused by botulinum toxin, one of the most toxic substances known."
    explanation: The abstract identifies botulinum toxin as the cause of the neuroparalytic disease.
- name: Acetylcholine Release Inhibition
  description: >-
    Botulinum toxin blocks stimulus-induced acetylcholine release at
    presynaptic nerve terminals, impairing neuromuscular transmission.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:8331029
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: IN_VITRO
    snippet: "Clostridium botulinum type toxin A (BoTx) blocks stimulus-induced acetylcholine (ACh) release from presynaptic nerve terminals at peripheral neuromuscular junctions."
    explanation: The abstract reports botulinum toxin inhibition of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The clinical manifestations are flaccid, symmetrical, descending paralysis affecting cranial and peripheral nerves."
    explanation: The abstract describes descending paralysis as the key clinical manifestation.
treatments:
- name: Botulinum Antitoxin

    snippet: "The only specific treatment is botulinum antitoxin."
    explanation: The abstract identifies botulinum antitoxin as the specific treatment.
