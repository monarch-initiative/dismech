    label: botulism
description: >-
  Botulism is a neuroparalytic illness caused by botulinum toxin exposure.
pathophysiology:
- name: Botulinum Neurotoxin-Mediated Neuromuscular Blockade
  description: >-
    Botulinum toxin causes neuroparalysis by disrupting neuromuscular function,
    resulting in descending paralysis.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:31157190
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Botulism is rare neuroparalytic disease caused by botulinum toxin, one
      of the most toxic substances known."
    explanation: The abstract identifies botulinum toxin as the cause of the
      neuroparalytic disease.
- name: Acetylcholine Release Inhibition
  description: >-
    Botulinum toxin blocks stimulus-induced acetylcholine release at
    presynaptic nerve terminals, impairing neuromuscular transmission.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:8331029
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: IN_VITRO
    snippet: "Clostridium botulinum type toxin A (BoTx) blocks stimulus-induced acetylcholine
      (ACh) release from presynaptic nerve terminals at peripheral neuromuscular junctions."
    explanation: The abstract reports botulinum toxin inhibition of
      acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions.
phenotypes:
- name: Paralysis
  category: Neurologic
  frequency: VERY_FREQUENT
  phenotype_term:
    preferred_term: Paralysis
    term:
      id: HP:0003470
      label: Paralysis
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:31157190
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The clinical manifestations are flaccid, symmetrical, descending paralysis
      affecting cranial and peripheral nerves."
    explanation: The abstract describes descending paralysis as the key clinical
      manifestation.
treatments:
- name: Botulinum Antitoxin
  description: Administration of botulinum antitoxin to neutralize circulating
    toxin.
  treatment_term:
    preferred_term: pharmacotherapy
    term:
      id: MAXO:0000058
      label: pharmacotherapy
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:31157190
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The only specific treatment is botulinum antitoxin."
    explanation: The abstract identifies botulinum antitoxin as the specific
      treatment.
