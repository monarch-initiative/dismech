description: 'Propionic acidemia is an autosomal recessive organic acidemia caused by deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase
  (PCC), usually due to biallelic PCCA or PCCB pathogenic variants. Defective propionate metabolism leads to toxic organic
  acid accumulation, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and recurrent episodes of life-threatening metabolic decompensation.
  Long-term complications include cardiomyopathy, prolonged QTc, intellectual disability, basal ganglia necrosis, pancreatitis,
  chronic kidney disease, and optic atrophy.
