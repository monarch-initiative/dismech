name: Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma
description: >-
  Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) is the most common subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma,
  accounting for approximately 60-70% of cases. It typically affects children under
  10 years of age with favorable primary sites including orbit, head and neck, and
  genitourinary tract. ERMS is characterized by loss of heterozygosity at 11p15,
  the locus containing IGF2 and other imprinted genes. Unlike alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma,
  ERMS lacks characteristic fusion genes and instead harbors a variety of mutations
  in RAS pathway genes. ERMS generally has a better prognosis than fusion-positive
  alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, with 5-year survival rates exceeding 70% for localized
  disease.

has_subtypes:
- name: Botryoid Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma
  description: >-
    A variant that grows as grape-like polypoid masses in mucosal-lined hollow
    organs such as the bladder, vagina, and nasopharynx. Has the best prognosis
    among ERMS variants.
- name: Spindle Cell Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma
  description: >-
    A variant with elongated spindle-shaped cells. When arising in paratesticular
    region, has excellent prognosis. Some cases harbor MYOD1 mutations.
- name: Anaplastic Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma
  description: >-
    A variant with marked nuclear pleomorphism and anaplasia. Associated with
    TP53 mutations and carries a worse prognosis.
pathophysiology:
- name: Loss of Heterozygosity at 11p15
  description: >-
    Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 11p15.5 is the hallmark genetic
    event in ERMS, occurring in approximately 80% of cases. This region contains
    the imprinted IGF2 gene, and LOH results in loss of the maternal allele with
    duplication of the paternal allele, leading to biallelic IGF2 expression
    and growth factor pathway activation.

  - reference: PMID:10095436
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Allelic losses of 11p15.5 are characteristic of embryonal RMS (eRMS), whereas an increase in the expression
      of the Igf2 gene located on 11p15.5 has regularly been observed in eRMS and alveolar RMS (aRMS)."
    explanation: "Supports 11p15.5 loss of heterozygosity as characteristic of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma."

- name: IGF2 Overexpression
  description: >-
    Loss of imprinting at 11p15 results in biallelic expression of IGF2, leading
    to autocrine and paracrine growth stimulation through IGF1R signaling. This
    promotes cell proliferation and survival in ERMS cells.

  description: >-
    Activating mutations in RAS pathway genes (NRAS, KRAS, HRAS) occur in
    approximately 35% of ERMS cases. FGFR4 mutations occur in 7-10% of cases.
    These mutations drive proliferation through MAPK and PI3K pathway activation.
