description: >-
  KIT-mutant melanoma is a molecular subtype occurring predominantly in acral,
  mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas, characterized by activating
  mutations or amplifications of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene. KIT
  mutations occur in approximately 15-20% of acral melanomas, 20-35% of mucosal
  melanomas, and 15-20% of melanomas arising on chronically sun-damaged skin,
  but are rare in common cutaneous melanomas. KIT signaling activates both MAPK
  and PI3K pathways, driving melanocyte proliferation and survival. KIT-mutant
  melanoma can be treated with imatinib and other KIT inhibitors, though responses
  are variable depending on mutation type, with exon 11 and 13 mutations showing
  better responses than amplification alone.

has_subtypes:
- name: Acral KIT-Mutant Melanoma
  description: >-
    Melanoma arising on acral surfaces (palms, soles, subungual regions) with
    KIT mutation. Represents the most common anatomic site for KIT-mutant
    melanoma. Not associated with sun exposure.
- name: Mucosal KIT-Mutant Melanoma
  description: >-
    Melanoma arising from mucosal surfaces (oral, nasal, genital, anorectal)
    with KIT mutation. Associated with poor prognosis due to delayed diagnosis
    and limited surgical options.
pathophysiology:
- name: KIT Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Activation
  description: >-
    KIT mutations, most commonly in exons 11, 13, and 17, result in constitutive
    receptor activation independent of stem cell factor (SCF) ligand binding.
    Mutations may cause ligand-independent dimerization, altered kinase domain
    conformation, or loss of autoinhibitory mechanisms, leading to persistent
    downstream signaling.

    Mutations in the juxtamembrane domain encoded by exon 11 disrupt autoinhibitory
    function, leading to constitutive receptor activation. These mutations typically
    show good response to imatinib therapy.

  association: Somatic Oncogenic Mutation
  notes: >-
    Mutations in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Some exon 17 mutations,

notes: >-
  KIT-mutant melanoma represents a distinct molecular subtype found in anatomic
  sites not typically associated with UV exposure, suggesting alternative
  pathogenic mechanisms. Testing for KIT mutations should be performed in acral,
  mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas to identify patients who may
  benefit from KIT inhibitor therapy. Response to imatinib is highly dependent
  on mutation type, with activating mutations showing better responses than
  amplification alone.
