name: Temple-Baraitser Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Temple-Baraitser syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder
  caused by gain-of-function mutations in KCNH1, which encodes the EAG1 voltage-gated
  potassium channel. The syndrome is characterized by severe intellectual disability,
  epilepsy, and distinctive limb anomalies including hypoplasia or aplasia of the
  thumbnails and great-toe nails with broadening and elongation of the thumbs and
  halluces. Additional features include characteristic facial dysmorphism with wide
  mouth and thick vermilion borders, developmental delays, and variable craniofacial
  abnormalities. Most cases arise from de novo mutations, though maternal mosaicism
  has been reported. The condition represents part of a spectrum that may overlap
  with Zimmermann-Laband syndrome.

      Temple-Baraitser syndrome follows autosomal dominant inheritance with complete
      penetrance. The vast majority of cases arise from de novo mutations in KCNH1.
      Interestingly, maternal mosaicism has been documented, with some mothers carrying
      low-level pathogenic mutations (10-27%) and exhibiting only epilepsy without
      other syndromic features.

        snippet: "The mutations occurred de novo in 4 patients, while two mothers of children with TBS, who have epilepsy but are otherwise healthy, are low-level (10% and 27%) mosaic carriers of pathogenic KCNH1 mutations."
        explanation: Demonstrates that most cases are de novo but maternal mosaicism can occur with milder phenotypes.
pathophysiology:
  - name: KCNH1 gain-of-function signaling
    description: >
      Pathogenic mutations in KCNH1 cause gain-of-function effects in the EAG1
      voltage-gated potassium channel. The mutant channels show decreased threshold
      of activation and delayed deactivation, leading to abnormal neuronal
      excitability and developmental abnormalities. KCNH1 is predominantly expressed
      in the central nervous system and plays critical roles in neuronal development
      and function. The altered channel kinetics disrupt normal neuronal signaling
      pathways essential for proper brain development and synaptic transmission.
      Recent studies demonstrate that disease-associated variants cluster in the S4
      voltage-sensor and S5-S6 pore domains, producing leftward shifts in activation
      voltage-dependence, faster activation kinetics, and delayed deactivation,
      thereby increasing channel open probability and K+ conductance at near-resting
      membrane potentials. These gating changes perturb neuronal excitability and
      network dynamics, explaining infantile-onset seizures and epileptiform EEG
      patterns. Additionally, hyperactive KCNH1 may disrupt primary cilia biology
      and Hedgehog signaling, potentially linking channel dysfunction to ectodermal
      developmental defects including nail/digit morphogenesis abnormalities.

notes: >
  Temple-Baraitser syndrome is notable for its distinctive combination of severe
  intellectual disability, epilepsy, and characteristic limb anomalies affecting
  the first rays. The nail aplasia/hypoplasia of thumbs and great toes with
  associated broadening is pathognomonic. The syndrome has clinical and genetic
  overlap with Zimmermann-Laband syndrome, suggesting these may represent a
  continuum of KCNH1-related disorders. The gain-of-function mechanism in a
  voltage-gated potassium channel represents an important example of how
  channelopathies can cause complex neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Recent
  molecular studies reveal that pathogenic variants cluster in critical S4-S6
  domains (exons 7-8) responsible for voltage sensing and channel gating,
  producing characteristic biophysical signatures including leftward-shifted
  activation, faster activation kinetics, and delayed deactivation. These
  changes increase channel open probability at near-resting potentials,
  disrupting neuronal excitability and potentially affecting primary cilia
  biology and Hedgehog signaling pathways important for ectodermal development.
  Maternal mosaicism with milder phenotypes (epilepsy only) has been documented,
  highlighting the importance of parental testing in genetic counseling.
  Comparative studies of related EAG-family channels (KCNH5) support a conserved
  gain-of-function pathomechanism across this channel family.
