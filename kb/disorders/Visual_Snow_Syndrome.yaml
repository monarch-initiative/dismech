pathophysiology:
- name: Visual Cortex Hyperexcitability
  description: >
    Visual snow syndrome is thought to involve cortical hyperexcitability,
    particularly in the lingual gyrus and other visual processing areas.
    Electrophysiological studies have revealed cortical hyperresponsivity
    in visual brain areas, and imaging studies demonstrated microstructural
    and functional connectivity alterations in multiple cortical and
    thalamic regions.

- name: Thalamocortical Network Dysfunction
  description: >
    Visual snow syndrome appears to be a network disorder involving
    dysfunction in the thalamocortical pathway. The thalamus normally
    filters sensory information, and its dysfunction may lead to
    failure to suppress unnecessary visual noise.
