description: Meckel diverticulum is the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct. It is a true diverticulum containing all layers of the intestinal wall and is typically located on the antimesenteric border of the ileum.

    snippet: "The use of stapling devices, with their ease of use and low complication rate, make it reasonable to remove any Meckel's diverticulum that easily fits in the device. If a diverticulum found incidentally is so broad-based or short that stapling cannot be done without difficulty, it is unlikely to become symptomatic and should be left undisturbed."
