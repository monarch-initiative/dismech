description: >
  22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a chromosomal microdeletion disorder caused by
  hemizygous deletion of 1.5-3 Mb at chromosome 22q11.2. It is the most common
  microdeletion syndrome, occurring in approximately 1:4000 live births. The
  phenotype is highly variable but classically includes conotruncal cardiac
  defects, thymic hypoplasia with T-cell immunodeficiency, hypocalcemia from
  parathyroid hypoplasia, and characteristic facial features. The deleted region
  contains TBX1, haploinsufficiency of which disrupts pharyngeal arch and
  cardiac neural crest development.

    description: >
      The critical gene within the 22q11.2 deletion is TBX1, a T-box transcription
      factor essential for pharyngeal arch development. TBX1 haploinsufficiency
      disrupts the proliferation and survival of pharyngeal mesoderm and neural
      crest cells, leading to defective development of pharyngeal arch derivatives
      including the thymus (3rd pouch), parathyroid glands (3rd/4th pouches),
      and cardiac outflow tract.

  - name: Cardiac neural crest migration defect
    description: >
      Neural crest cells from the occipital somites migrate through pharyngeal
      arches 3, 4, and 6 to contribute to aorticopulmonary septation and great
      vessel remodeling. TBX1 deficiency impairs neural crest cell migration and
      survival through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, as TBX1 is expressed in
      pharyngeal mesoderm rather than neural crest cells themselves.

  - name: Thymic hypoplasia and T-cell immunodeficiency
    description: >
      The thymus derives from the third pharyngeal pouch. Impaired pharyngeal
      pouch development leads to thymic hypoplasia or aplasia, resulting in
      reduced T-cell production. The immunodeficiency is typically partial,
      with low but functional T-cell numbers, though complete thymic aplasia
      (complete DiGeorge syndrome) occurs in ~1% of cases.
