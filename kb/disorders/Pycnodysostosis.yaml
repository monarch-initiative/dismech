  Pycnodysostosis is an autosomal recessive osteochondrodysplasia caused by
  loss-of-function mutations in the CTSK gene encoding cathepsin K, a lysosomal
  cysteine protease highly expressed in osteoclasts. Cathepsin K is the major
  protease responsible for degradation of type I collagen in the bone matrix.
  In pycnodysostosis, osteoclasts can acidify the resorption lacuna normally
  but cannot degrade the organic bone matrix, leading to osteosclerosis and
  short stature. Characteristic features include increased bone density with
  pathologic fractures, open fontanelles and sutures, and short stature.
  The French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is believed to have had
  this condition.

pathophysiology:
- name: Cathepsin K Deficiency in Osteoclasts
  description: >
    Cathepsin K is a lysosomal cysteine protease with highest expression in
    osteoclasts. Loss-of-function mutations cause total loss or inactivity
    of cathepsin K protein. Hot mutation spots are found in exons 6 and 7,
    with 70% of mutations in the mature domain.

- name: Impaired Organic Bone Matrix Degradation
  description: >
    Cathepsin K is the major protease responsible for degradation of type I
    collagen in the bone matrix during bone resorption. Unlike osteopetrosis,
    osteoclasts in pycnodysostosis can acidify the resorption lacuna normally
    but cannot degrade the demineralized organic matrix. This leads to
    accumulation of undigested collagen matrix and osteosclerosis.
