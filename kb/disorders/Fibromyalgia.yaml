pathophysiology:
- name: Central Sensitization
  description: >
    Augmented pain processing in the central nervous system leads to
    amplified pain perception. Increased excitatory neurotransmitters
    (glutamate, substance P) and decreased inhibitory modulation.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:7526868
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "CSF SP levels were 3-fold higher in FMS patients than in normal controls (P < 0.001)"
    explanation: Elevated substance P in cerebrospinal fluid directly supports central sensitization mechanism with increased excitatory nociceptive signaling.
  - reference: PMID:21684692
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of glutamate to GABA and decreased expression or activity of this enzyme could result in an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the ascending and descending pain pathways."
    explanation: Proposes mechanism for excitatory/inhibitory imbalance underlying central sensitization via altered GAD activity affecting glutamate-GABA balance.
  - reference: PMID:33494476
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Fibromyalgia is the most common of the central sensitivity syndromes affecting 2-5% of the adult population in the United States. This pain amplification syndrome has enormous societal impact"
    explanation: Establishes fibromyalgia as a prototypical central sensitivity syndrome with augmented pain processing.

    snippet: "We report elevated cerebrospinal fluid and serum concentrations of interleukin-8, but not interleukin-1beta, in FM patients. This profile is in accordance with FM symptoms being mediated by sympathetic activity rather than dependent on prostaglandin associated mechanisms and supports the hypothesis of glia cell activation in response to pain mechanisms."

    explanation: Demonstrates altered circadian cortisol rhythm with delayed decline indicating loss of HPA axis resiliency.
  - reference: PMID:7980669
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "These data support the view that HPA axis function is perturbed in patients with FM."

    snippet: "These include central sensitization, associated with an increase in the release of both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters; peripheral sensitization, involving alterations in peripheral nociceptor signaling; and inflammatory and immune mechanisms that develop concurrently with the aforementioned processes."
    explanation: Snippet supports peripheral sensitization broadly but does not directly provide evidence for small-fiber structural pathology or reduced IENFD.

    and sensory signaling. CNS-enriched heritability with neural gene prioritization
