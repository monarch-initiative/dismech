name: Basal Cell Carcinoma
description: >-
  Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common human malignancy, arising from
  basal cells of the epidermis and hair follicles. The majority of BCCs are driven
  by aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, most commonly
  through loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1 (the Hedgehog receptor that normally
  inhibits Smoothened) or less frequently through activating mutations in SMO
  (Smoothened). UV radiation is the primary environmental risk factor, with BCCs
  occurring predominantly on sun-exposed skin. While locally invasive and destructive,
  BCC rarely metastasizes. Surgical excision is curative for most BCCs, but advanced
  or metastatic disease can be treated with Hedgehog pathway inhibitors such as
  vismodegib and sonidegib.

has_subtypes:
- name: Nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Most common BCC subtype (60-80%), presenting as a pearly, dome-shaped nodule
    with telangiectasias and rolled borders. May develop central ulceration
    (rodent ulcer).
- name: Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Second most common subtype (10-15%), presenting as a thin, erythematous
    scaly plaque. Often occurs on the trunk and may be multifocal. Generally
    less aggressive than nodular type.
- name: Morpheaform (Sclerosing) Basal Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Aggressive subtype with ill-defined borders and scar-like appearance.
    Shows extensive subclinical extension and higher recurrence rates.
    Requires wide excision margins.
- name: Infiltrative Basal Cell Carcinoma
  description: >-
    Aggressive variant with thin strands of tumor cells infiltrating the dermis.
    Often has poorly defined clinical margins and higher recurrence rates.
pathophysiology:
- name: PTCH1 Loss of Function
  description: >-
    PTCH1 (Patched 1) encodes a transmembrane receptor that normally suppresses
    Smoothened (SMO) in the absence of Hedgehog ligand. Loss-of-function mutations
    in PTCH1 release SMO from inhibition, resulting in constitutive Hedgehog pathway
    activation. PTCH1 mutations occur in approximately 70% of sporadic BCCs and
    are the germline cause of Gorlin syndrome.

  description: >-
    Smoothened (SMO) is a G-protein coupled receptor-like protein that transduces
    Hedgehog signal. Activating mutations in SMO, though less common than PTCH1
    loss, render SMO constitutively active regardless of PTCH1 status. Some SMO
    mutations confer resistance to vismodegib.

    description: Activating SMO mutations bypass PTCH1 inhibition
- name: Constitutive Hedgehog Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    Loss of PTCH1 or activating SMO mutations result in constitutive activation
    of the Hedgehog signaling cascade. Active SMO translocates to the primary
    cilium and promotes activation of GLI transcription factors (GLI1, GLI2),
    which drive expression of target genes promoting proliferation and survival.

  description: >-
    Active Hedgehog signaling promotes GLI transcription factor processing and
    nuclear translocation. GLI1 and GLI2 activate transcription of target genes
    including PTCH1, GLI1 (positive feedback), cyclin D1, MYC, and BCL2,
    promoting proliferation and survival of basal cells.

    The proliferating cells maintain a basal cell phenotype with peripheral
    palisading characteristic of BCC histology.

environmental:
- name: Ultraviolet Radiation
  description: >-
    Chronic UV exposure is the primary risk factor for BCC development.
    UV signature mutations (C>T transitions at dipyrimidine sites) are
    found in most BCCs. Both UVA and UVB contribute to BCC risk.
genetic:
- name: PTCH1
  association: Loss-of-Function Mutations
  notes: >-
    PTCH1 encodes the Hedgehog receptor. Biallelic inactivation (loss of heterozygosity
    or compound heterozygous mutations) occurs in approximately 70% of sporadic BCCs.
    Germline PTCH1 mutations cause Gorlin syndrome (nevoid basal cell carcinoma
    syndrome) with multiple BCCs, jaw cysts, and other developmental abnormalities.
- name: SMO
  association: Activating Mutations
  notes: >-
    Smoothened mutations occur in approximately 10% of BCCs without PTCH1 mutations.
    Some SMO mutations (D473H) confer primary or acquired resistance to vismodegib
    and sonidegib.
- name: TP53
  association: Somatic Mutations
  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in approximately 40-50% of BCCs, often with UV signature.
    TP53 inactivation contributes to genomic instability and tumor progression
    but is not sufficient for BCC development without Hedgehog pathway activation.

notes: >-
  BCC is the most common cancer worldwide, with incidence continuing to rise.
  While metastasis is rare (less than 0.5%), locally advanced BCC can cause
  significant morbidity through tissue destruction. Hedgehog pathway inhibitors
  have transformed treatment of advanced disease, but resistance develops in
  most patients through SMO mutations or downstream pathway alterations. The
  high tumor mutational burden of BCC (UV signature) provides rationale for
  immunotherapy approaches.
