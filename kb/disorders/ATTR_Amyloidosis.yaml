    snippet: Transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a life-threatening, gain-of-toxic-function disease characterised by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils composed of transthyretin (TTR). TTR protein destabilised by TTR gene mutation is prone to dissociate from its native tetramer to monomer, and to then misfold and aggregate into amyloid fibrils, resulting in autosomal dominant hereditary amyloidosis.
    explanation: The literature clearly states that mutations in the TTR gene lead to the misfolding of transthyretin proteins, which then aggregate into amyloid fibrils, supporting the statement.
