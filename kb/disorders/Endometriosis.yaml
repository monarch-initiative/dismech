pathophysiology:
- name: Ectopic Endometrial Tissue
  description: >
    Endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterus, commonly on
    ovaries, fallopian tubes, and pelvic peritoneum. Responds to
    hormonal cycling with bleeding and inflammation.

  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:16166933
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Endometriosis is classically described as the presence of both endometrial glandular and stromal cells outside the uterine cavity, mainly in the pelvis."
    explanation: Defines endometriosis as ectopic presence of endometrial glandular and stromal cells outside the uterus
- name: Retrograde Menstruation
  description: >
    Menstrual blood flows backward through fallopian tubes into
    pelvic cavity. Most women have retrograde menstruation, but only
    some develop endometriosis, suggesting other factors involved.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:16166933
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Although multiple theories have been put forth to explain the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of endometriosis, the retrograde menstruation theory of Sampson is the most widely accepted. However, since retrograde menstruation occurs in most of the reproductive age women, it is clear that there must be other factors which may contribute to the implantation of endometrial cells and their subsequent development into endometriotic disease."
    explanation: Retrograde menstruation is the most widely accepted theory but insufficient alone to explain disease development
- name: Chronic Inflammation
  description: >
    Ectopic lesions trigger chronic pelvic inflammation with elevated
    cytokines and prostaglandins. Inflammatory milieu contributes to
    pain and adhesion formation.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Inflammatory Response
    term:
      id: GO:0006954
      label: inflammatory response
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:16166933
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Increased levels of several cytokines and growth factors which are secreted by either immune and endometrial cells seem to promote implantation and growth of ectopic endometrium by inducing proliferation and angiogenesis."
    explanation: Elevated cytokines and growth factors in the inflammatory milieu support lesion implantation and growth
- name: Estrogen Dependence
  description: >
    Endometriotic lesions produce their own estrogen via aromatase
    and are highly estrogen-responsive. Progesterone resistance
    impairs normal tissue regression.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Estrogen Response
    term:
      id: GO:0043627
      label: response to estrogen
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:10731122
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Estrogen is the most important known factor that stimulates the growth of endometriosis. Estrogen delivery to endometriotic implants was classically viewed to be only via the circulating blood in an endocrine fashion. We recently uncovered an autocrine positive feedback mechanism, which favored the continuous production of estrogen and prostaglandin (PG)E2 in the endometriotic stromal cells."
    explanation: Estrogen drives endometriosis growth through both systemic delivery and local autocrine production
  - reference: PMID:10731122
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The enzyme, aromatase, is aberrantly expressed in endometriotic stromal cells and catalyzes the conversion of C19 steroids to estrogens, which then stimulate cyclooxygenase-2 to increase the levels of PGE2. PGE2, in turn, is a potent inducer of aromatase activity in endometriotic stromal cells. Aromatase is not expressed in the eutopic endometrium."
    explanation: Aromatase expression in endometriotic stromal cells creates a positive feedback loop with PGE2 for local estrogen production
  - reference: PMID:10731122
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In addition, we find that endometriotic tissue is deficient in 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which is normally expressed in eutopic endometrial glandular cells and inactivates estradiol-17beta to estrone. This deficiency is another aberration that favors higher levels of estradiol-17beta in endometriotic tissues in comparison with the eutopic endometrium."
    explanation: Deficiency of 17beta-HSD type 2 prevents estradiol inactivation, contributing to local estrogen dominance
- name: Immune Dysfunction
  description: >
    Immune system alterations enable ectopic endometrial cells to evade
    clearance. Includes increased peritoneal macrophages, reduced NK cell
    cytotoxicity, T cell dysfunction, and elevated inflammatory cytokines.
    Crosstalk between endometrial stromal cells and macrophages impairs
    NK cell function via IL-10 and TGF-beta secretion.

  - preferred_term: Inflammatory Response
    term:
      id: GO:0006954
      label: inflammatory response
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:16166933
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Increased number and activation of peritoneal macrophages, decreased T cell and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicities are the alterations in cellular immunity and result in inadequate removal of ectopic endometrial cells from the peritoneal cavity."
    explanation: Immune cell dysfunction leads to impaired clearance of ectopic endometrial cells
  - reference: PMID:28971893
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The dysfunction of NK cells in women with endometriosis (EMS) contributes to the immune escape of menstrual endometrial fragments refluxed into the peritoneal cavity."
    explanation: NK cell dysfunction is a key mechanism enabling immune escape of refluxed endometrial fragments
  - reference: PMID:28971893
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "After incubation with ESCs and macrophages, the expression of CD16, NKG2D, perforin and IFN-γ, viability and cytotoxicity of NK cells were significantly downregulated. The secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in the co-culture system of ESCs and macrophages was increased."
    explanation: Interaction between endometrial stromal cells and macrophages suppresses NK cell cytotoxicity through IL-10 and TGF-beta
- name: Hypoxia and Angiogenesis
  description: >
    Ectopic lesions experience hypoxia which stabilizes HIF-1alpha,
    upregulating VEGF and promoting angiogenesis. Neovascularization
    supports lesion survival and growth. Ovarian endometriomas show
    particularly high expression of hypoxic and angiogenic factors.

      label: angiogenesis
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:26408396
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Endometriosis is associated with local angiogenic and hypoxic mechanisms. Indeed, peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis generates a specific microenvironment to support the growth and development of ectopic endometrial tissues."
    explanation: Angiogenic and hypoxic mechanisms create a supportive microenvironment for ectopic lesion growth
  - reference: PMID:26408396
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Ovarian endometrioma expresses high levels of HIF-1/2α, PAR-1/4, and VEGF-A, while DIE did not show significantly different gene expression compared to endometrium from unaffected women. A positive correlation between the expression of HIF-1/2α and VEGF-A mRNA was observed in OMA."
    explanation: Ovarian endometriomas specifically show elevated hypoxia-inducible factors and VEGF with correlated expression
  - reference: PMID:30074218
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The results showed that serum concentrations of MMIF, HIF-1α, and VEGF were significantly higher in EM patients than in controls (P<0.05). The expression of all three proteins in both serum and endometrial tissues increased significantly with the R-AFS stage (P<0.05) and with dysmenorrheal severity (P<0.05)."
    explanation: HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression correlates with disease stage and dysmenorrhea severity
- name: Adhesion Formation
  description: >
    Chronic inflammation leads to fibrous adhesions distorting pelvic
    anatomy. Adhesions contribute to pain and infertility.
