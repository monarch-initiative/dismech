- name: Type III secretion system-mediated invasion and vacuolar escape
  description: >
    Shigella uses a plasmid-encoded Type III secretion system (T3SS/mxi-spa) to deliver bacterial effector proteins directly into host cells.
    The translocon proteins IpaB and IpaC assemble a funnel-shaped pore in target membranes through which the injectisome docks and delivers effectors.
    IpaC activates small GTPases and actin nucleation to promote bacterial uptake. IpaB mediates phagosomal membrane disruption and directly activates caspase-1 in macrophages,
    triggering pyroptotic cell death. This allows bacterial escape from the phagolysosome into the cytosol, where Shigella replicates and spreads.

- name: Actin-based motility and cell-to-cell spread
  description: >
    Within the host cell cytosol, Shigella recruits the host actin polymerization machinery via the polar adhesin IcsA/VirG.
    The N-WASP (WASL) and Arp2/3 complex are recruited to the bacterial pole, forming actin comet tails that propel the pathogen toward and through
    the cell membrane into adjacent cells. IcsP regulates IcsA surface distribution; IcsB aids in autophagy evasion. This cell-to-cell spread
    mechanism drives epithelial fenestration, mucosal ulceration, and the characteristic invasive colitis phenotype without exposure to the lumen.

  description: >
    Cytosolic detection of Shigella T3SS components (MxiH, MxiI) and other danger signals activates the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome complex.
    Non-canonical inflammasome sensing via caspase-4/5 detects cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both pathways converge on caspase-1 and caspase-4/5 activation,
    which cleave gasdermin D (GSDMD) to form membrane pores, leading to pyroptotic cell death, cytokine release (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-8), and recruitment of neutrophils.
    Shigella modulates this response via IpaH family E3 ligases (e.g., IpaH7.8) to favor bacterial survival and dissemination.
