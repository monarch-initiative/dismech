    snippet: Behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD; 12/21) was the most common phenotype...
      bvFTD and PPA are the most common clinical phenotypes associated with PiD...
    explanation: The reference identifies that behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) is a
      common presentation of Pick's disease, implying that PiD can be characterized
      by bvFTD symptoms.

      predominantly apathetic with less florid social disinhibition and eating disturbances,
      and were more anxious than bvFTD(Pick's) patients.
    explanation: The study confirms that some patients with corticobasal degeneration
      (CBD) pathology showing bvFTD symptoms have similar trait overlaps with those
      having Pick's disease.

      bodies... The clinical phenotypes of Pick's disease include behavioral variant
      FTD (bvFTD), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD).
    explanation: This reference confirms that Pick's disease includes subtypes such
      as progressive nonfluent aphasia and semantic dementia, which are associated
      with prominent language deterioration as an initial symptom.

    snippet: 'Four clinical subtypes characterize the predominant presentations of
      this illness: behavioral or frontal variant FTD, progressive nonfluent aphasia,
      semantic dementia, and logopenic primary progressive aphasia.'
    explanation: This reference specifies that frontotemporal dementia, which includes
      Pick's disease, has subtypes including progressive nonfluent aphasia and semantic
      dementia, both associated with prominent initial language deterioration.

    supports: REFUTE
    snippet: It can occur at any age, but most patients develop the disease between
      the age of 40 to 50 years.
    explanation: The onset of systemic sclerosis is mentioned to occur between the
      ages of 40-50, which suggests that many cases do not fall within the 40-65 range
      exclusively for progression.
  - reference: PMID:19415691
    supports: REFUTE
    snippet: Although age of onset varied significantly, the rate of progression appeared
      linear, independent of age of onset, and similar in all patients.
    explanation: The disease Niemann-Pick type C progression appears linear and independent
      of age of onset, suggesting that age between 40-65 is not particularly relevant
      for progression. This contradicts the statement's implication of age-specific
      progression.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Patients with disease onset between 40 and 59 years used a walker after
      10.2 +/- 5.8 years, whereas those with disease onset between 60 and 79 years
      used a walker after 5.7 +/- 5.0 years.
    explanation: There is a clear distinction in disease progression based on age
      of onset, indicating that progression characteristics might indeed differ across
      specific age ranges.

        characteristic in several other neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal
        dementia, Pick Disease, Alzheimer disease, argyrophilic grain disease,
        progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration.
      explanation: This review establishes that abnormal tau protein aggregation
        is a defining pathological characteristic of Pick Disease, which is classified
        as a subtype of frontotemporal dementia.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:20487487
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Pick's disease is a rare and incurable type of dementia that is associated
      with atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain over time as a result
      of accumulation of tau protein fibres known as Pick's bodies.
    explanation: The accumulation of tau proteins in the brain is mentioned as a central
      feature of Pick's disease, supporting the statement.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: Pick disease tau neuropathology may originate in limbic/paralimbic cortices.
      The patterns of tau pathology observed here provide novel insights into the

    explanation: The mechanistic understanding of tau filaments in Pick's disease
      supports the idea that tau protein accumulation leads to neuron damage and brain
      dysfunction.

    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: Arnold Pick (1851-1924) provided the first description of the neurodegenerative
      disease associated with his name; but his importance to the field of neuroscience
      goes far beyond this eponymous gift. His view that the process of dementia should
      be seen as a mosaic of circumscribed neuropsychological deficits and not as
      a diffuse degradation of mental abilities is essential for progress in a cognitive
      neuropsychological approach to the study of dementias.
    explanation: This literature is historical and conceptual, focusing on Arnold
      Pick's contributions and perspectives on dementia, but does not mention chronic
      inflammation or neuroinflammation related to neuronal death in Pick Disease.

    explanation: MND (Motor Neuron Disease) does overlap with frontotemporal dementia
      and associated behavioral changes, but this is not directly related to Pick's
      disease and does not provide evidence for high-frequency psychiatric phenotypes
      in Pick's disease.

    snippet: 'The clinical presentation in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) reflects
      the distribution of the pathologic changes rather than the exact histologic
      subtype of the disease. Three major clinical syndromes can be identified: 1)
      frontal variant FTD (dementia of frontal type) in which changes in social behavior
      and personality predominate, reflecting the orbitobasal frontal lobe focus of
      the pathology. Traditional cognitive tests are insensitive, but more specific
      measures are under development; 2) semantic dementia (progressive fluent aphasia)
      in which there is a breakdown in the conceptual database which underlies language
      production and comprehension, although deficits in nonverbal semantic knowledge
      can also be shown on neuropsychologic testing. Patients with semantic dementia
      have asymmetric anterolateral temporal atrophy with relative sparing of the
      hippocampal formation, which is typically worse on the left side. A variant
      of this syndrome affecting the right temporal lobe presents with progressive
      prosopagnosia; 3) progressive nonfluent aphasia in which the phonologic and
      syntactic components of language are affected in association with left peri-Sylvian
      atrophy. The assessment of patients with potential FTD involves a multidisciplinary
      approach. The development of comprehensive caregiver-based neuropsychiatric
      instruments, neuropsychologic tasks sensitive to semantic memory and other key
      cognitive impairments, and functional (hexamethyly-propyleneamine-SPECT) and
      structural (MRI) brain imaging represent significant advances in the field.'

      and not typically referred to as being caused by a Mendelian germline mutation.

    snippet: The author reviews the gross, microscopic, and biochemical pathology
      associated with classic Pick's disease, as defined by Constantinidis' Type A
      Pick's disease.
    explanation: The reviewed literature discusses the pathology of Pick's disease
      but does not support a simple Mendelian genetic subtype driven by a germline
      mutation in the MAPT gene.

    snippet: Heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the human progranulin
      gene (GRN) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) by a mechanism of
      haploinsufficiency.
    explanation: The literature supports that mutations in the GRN gene are associated
      with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, which encompasses various clinical presentations
      including Pick's disease. However, it does not explicitly state the association
      with Pick's disease as a specific subtype in a Mendelian fashion.

    snippet: No individual mtDNA haplogroups or superhaplogroups were significantly
      associated with risk of Pick disease after adjustment for multiple testing.
    explanation: The study focused on mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and their association
      with Pick disease risk, finding no significant association. It did not address
      the GRN gene or its mutations.

  category: Transgene Insertion
  description: The human Tau containing three ~32 amino acid repeats bearing the L266V
    and G272V mutations associated with familial forms of Picks Disease is under the
    control of the neuronal mouse Thy1 promoter. Line 13 is a high expressing line
    and expresses 8 fold higher levels than line 2.
  associated_phenotypes:
  - Impaired Coordination
  - Abnormal Dentate Gyrus Morphology
  - Decreased Neocortex Volume
  - Tau Protein Deposits
  - Axonal Dystrophy

    snippet: In addition, the Tg mice developed age-related motor weakness as well
      as progressive hyperphosphorylation and decreased solubility of brain and spinal
      cord tau proteins
    explanation: The literature supports tau protein deposits and motor weakness (a
      potential indication of impaired coordination). However, it does not explicitly
      confirm abnormal dentate gyrus morphology, decreased neocortex volume, or axonal
      dystrophy.

    snippet: Both brains showed severe neuronal loss in the temporal cortex, whereas
      in the frontal cortex the loss was less; and abundant Pick bodies in the dentate
      gyrus of the hippocampus, and caudate nucleus. The Pick bodies consisted exclusively
      of three-repeat (3R) isoforms.
    explanation: Confirms tau protein deposits and identifies neuronal loss in specific
      brain regions, which can be interpreted as related to decreased neocortex volume.
      However, it does not confirm impaired coordination or axonal dystrophy, and
      focuses on human tissue rather than animal models.
