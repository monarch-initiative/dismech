description: 'Arginase 1 (ARG1) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic
  variants in the ARG1 gene. ARG1 catalyzes the final step of the urea cycle, hydrolyzing L-arginine to ornithine and urea.
  Loss of ARG1 activity leads to persistent hyperargininemia and accumulation of neurotoxic guanidino compounds, with relatively
  infrequent hyperammonemia compared to other urea cycle disorders. The hallmark clinical presentation includes progressive
  spastic diplegia or paraparesis, seizures, intellectual disability, and growth retardation, typically manifesting in early
  childhood. The estimated global birth prevalence is approximately 2.8 per 1,000,000 live births.

    snippet: Hyperargininemia is one of the few treatable causes of pediatric spastic paraparesis, and can be confused with
      cerebral palsy.
    explanation: Identifying the treatable nature of spasticity supports active spasticity management.
- name: Antiepileptic therapy
  description: 'Seizure management with appropriate antiepileptic drugs, given that seizures occur in 60-75% of patients.
    Seizure control is an important aspect of supportive care.

    snippet: Seizures in hyperargininemia may be more common than reported in previous studies.
    explanation: High seizure frequency supports the need for antiepileptic management.
- name: Newborn screening
  description: 'Arginase deficiency is detectable by newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry with elevated arginine
    as the primary marker. Use of the arginine-to-ornithine ratio improves sensitivity and specificity, as neonatal arginine
    levels may appear near-normal due to maternal arginase or ARG2 activity.

    snippet: Improved newborn screening effectiveness should lead to better case detection and more rapid treatment to lower
      plasma arginine levels hence improving long term outcome of individuals with hyperargininemia.
    explanation: Supports early detection through newborn screening for improved outcomes.
- name: Genetic counseling
  description: 'Genetic counseling for affected families including discussion of autosomal recessive inheritance, 25% recurrence
    risk, carrier testing, and prenatal diagnostic options. Carrier screening implications are increasingly recognized given
    the expanding understanding of ARG1 variant pathogenicity.

    snippet: Arginase-1 (ARG1) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects the liver-based urea cycle,
      leading to impaired ureagenesis.
    explanation: Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern supports the role of genetic counseling.
notes: 'Key distinguishing features of ARG1 deficiency among urea cycle disorders: (1) hyperammonemia is infrequent rather
  than dominant; (2) progressive spastic paraparesis is the hallmark presentation; (3) the disease is often initially confused
  with cerebral palsy or hereditary spastic paraplegia; (4) chronic arginine toxicity and guanidino compound accumulation
  drive neurological injury rather than acute ammonia crises. The Phase 3 PEACE trial of pegzilarginase represents a major
  advance, demonstrating that sustained arginine normalization is achievable and associated with functional mobility improvements.
  Gene therapy and mRNA therapeutic approaches are in preclinical development. Caution is warranted in extrapolating mouse
  model findings, as the lethal disease phenotype in mice is substantially more severe than in humans.
