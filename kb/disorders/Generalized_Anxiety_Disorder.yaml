pathophysiology:
- name: Amygdala Hyperactivity
  description: >
    Exaggerated amygdala response to perceived threats leads to
    excessive fear and anxiety. Reduced prefrontal cortex regulation
    of amygdala activity.

  - preferred_term: Amygdala Pyramidal Neuron
    term:
      id: CL:4023110
      label: amygdala pyramidal neuron

      id: GO:0042596
      label: fear response
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38865810
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Evidence indicates that anxiety disorders arise from an imbalance in the functioning of brain circuits that govern the modulation of emotional responses to possibly threatening stimuli. The circuits under consideration in this context include the amygdala's bottom-up activity, which signifies the existence of stimuli that may be seen as dangerous. Moreover, these circuits encompass top-down regulatory processes that originate in the prefrontal cortex, facilitating the communication of the emotional significance associated with the inputs."
    explanation: This evidence supports the model of amygdala hyperactivity in anxiety and the role of prefrontal cortex in regulating amygdala responses to threat stimuli.
- name: GABA System Dysfunction
  description: >
    Reduced GABAergic inhibition contributes to neuronal hyperexcitability
    and anxiety. Benzodiazepines enhance GABA function.
  cell_types:
  - preferred_term: GABAergic Interneuron
    term:
      id: CL:0011005
      label: GABAergic interneuron
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: GABAergic Transmission
    term:

      label: synaptic transmission, GABAergic
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38865810
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "A decrease in GABAergic activity is present in both anxiety disorders and severe depression. Research on cerebral functional imaging in depressive individuals has shown reduced levels of GABA within the cortical regions. Additionally, animal studies demonstrated that a reduction in the expression of GABAA/B receptors results in a behavioral pattern resembling anxiety."
    explanation: This evidence demonstrates reduced GABAergic activity in anxiety disorders through both imaging studies and animal models showing that decreased GABA receptor expression leads to anxiety-like behavior.
  - reference: PMID:38865810
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "The amygdala consists of inhibitory networks composed of GABAergic interneurons, responsible for modulating anxiety responses in both normal and pathological conditions. The GABAA receptor has allosteric sites (e.g., α/γ, γ/β, and α/β) which enable regulation of neuronal inhibition in the amygdala. These sites serve as molecular targets for anxiolytic medications such as benzodiazepine and barbiturates."
    explanation: This supports the mechanism of GABAergic dysfunction in the amygdala and explains how benzodiazepines work by targeting GABAA receptor allosteric sites to enhance inhibition.
  - reference: PMID:39294497
    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: "We leveraged information from more than 1.2 million participants, including 97,383 cases, to investigate the genetics of anxiety disorders across five continental groups. Through ancestry-specific and cross-ancestry genome-wide association studies, we identified 51 anxiety-associated loci, 39 of which were novel."
    explanation: This snippet supports broad genetic architecture of anxiety disorders but does not directly provide evidence for GABA system dysfunction.
- name: Serotonin Dysregulation
  description: >
    Altered serotonin signaling, particularly in raphe-prefrontal
    circuits, contributes to anxiety. SSRIs are first-line treatment.
  cell_types:
  - preferred_term: Serotonergic Neuron
    term:
      id: CL:0000850
      label: serotonergic neuron
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Serotonin Signaling
    term:
      id: GO:0007268
      label: chemical synaptic transmission
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:24936175
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Decreased serotonergic activity has been implicated in anxiety and major depression, and antidepressants directly or indirectly increase the long-term activity of the serotonin system. A key component of serotonin circuitry is the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, which functions as the major somatodendritic autoreceptor to negatively regulate the 'gain' of the serotonin system."
    explanation: This evidence establishes the role of decreased serotonergic activity in anxiety and explains how antidepressants work by increasing serotonin system activity.
  - reference: PMID:24936175
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "In addition, 5-HT1A heteroreceptors are abundantly expressed post-synaptically in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and hippocampus to mediate serotonin actions on fear, anxiety, stress, and cognition."
    explanation: This supports the specific role of serotonin signaling in prefrontal-limbic circuits that regulate anxiety and fear responses.
- name: HPA Axis Dysregulation
  description: >
    Chronic activation of the stress response system with elevated
    cortisol contributes to sustained anxiety and physical symptoms.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Stress Response
    term:
      id: GO:0006950
      label: response to stress
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:20808146
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common disorder in older adults, which has been linked to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in this age group."
    explanation: This evidence directly links GAD to HPA axis hyperactivity, particularly in older adults.
  - reference: PMID:20808146
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Compared with placebo-treated patients, SSRI-treated patients had a significantly greater reduction in both peak and total cortisol. This reduction in cortisol was limited to patients with elevated (above the median) baseline cortisol, in whom SSRI-treated patients showed substantially greater reduction in cortisol than did placebo-treated patients. Reductions in cortisol were associated with improvements in anxiety."
    explanation: This demonstrates that HPA axis hyperactivity with elevated cortisol is present in GAD patients and that successful treatment reduces cortisol levels in parallel with anxiety symptom reduction.
- name: Noradrenergic Hyperactivity
  description: >
    Elevated norepinephrine activity in locus coeruleus contributes
    to hyperarousal and somatic symptoms of anxiety.
  cell_types:
  - preferred_term: Noradrenergic Neuron
    term:
      id: CL:0008025
      label: noradrenergic neuron
- name: Oxidative Stress
  description: >
    Increased oxidative stress markers and reduced antioxidant enzyme
    activity in GAD patients. Elevated malondialdehyde and reduced
    superoxide dismutase correlate with symptom severity.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38204917
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The 8-OHdG values of the GAD group were determined to be statistically significantly higher than those of the control group (p=0.028)."
    explanation: This demonstrates elevated oxidative DNA damage in GAD patients as measured by 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative stress.
  - reference: PMID:38204917
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "The results of this study showed that there could be DNA damage because of oxidative stress in GAD patients."
    explanation: This concludes that oxidative stress contributes to the pathophysiology of GAD through DNA damage mechanisms.
- name: Epigenetic Alterations
  description: >
    DNA methylation changes in anxiety-related genes, particularly in
    monocytes and granulocytes. Methylation sites identified in genes
    involved in neurogenesis and fear memory.

    snippet: "Applying an enrichment-based sequencing approach covering nearly 28 million autosomal CpG sites, we conducted a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) of lifetime ANX in 1132 participants (618 cases/514 controls) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Using epigenomic deconvolution, we performed MWAS for the main cell types in blood: granulocytes, T-cells, B-cells and monocytes. Cell-type specific analyses identified 280 and 82 methylome-wide significant associations (q-value < 0.1) in monocytes and granulocytes, respectively."
    explanation: This large-scale epigenome-wide study identifies hundreds of significant DNA methylation sites associated with anxiety disorders, supporting the role of epigenetic mechanisms in GAD pathophysiology.

    snippet: "In monocytes, two specific sites in the FZR1 gene showed significant replication after Bonferroni correction with an additional 15 nominally replicated sites in monocytes and 4 in T-cells. FZR1 regulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and its knockout leads to impairments in associative fear memory and long-term potentiation in mice."
    explanation: This identifies FZR1 as a key gene with replicable methylation changes in anxiety, linking epigenetic alterations to hippocampal neurogenesis and fear memory mechanisms.
