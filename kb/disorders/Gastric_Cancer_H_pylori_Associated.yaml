description: >-
  Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric cancer represents the majority of gastric
  adenocarcinomas worldwide. H. pylori is classified as a Class I carcinogen by the
  IARC, with chronic infection driving a cascade from gastritis to atrophic gastritis,
  intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and ultimately carcinoma (the Correa cascade).
  Both intestinal and diffuse histologic types can arise in the setting of H. pylori
  infection, though intestinal-type adenocarcinoma follows the classic progression
  pathway. H. pylori eradication can reduce gastric cancer risk, particularly when
  performed before development of premalignant lesions.

has_subtypes:
- name: Intestinal-Type Adenocarcinoma
  description: >-
    Well-to-moderately differentiated tumors with glandular architecture,
    arising through the classic Correa pathway of atrophic gastritis to
    intestinal metaplasia to dysplasia to carcinoma. More common in high-
    incidence regions and associated with H. pylori infection.
- name: Diffuse-Type Adenocarcinoma
  description: >-
    Poorly differentiated tumors with scattered single cells or small clusters
    infiltrating the gastric wall (signet ring cell carcinoma). Associated
    with CDH1/E-cadherin loss. Can also arise in H. pylori-infected mucosa
    but does not require intestinal metaplasia.
infectious_agent:
- name: Helicobacter pylori
  description: >-
    H. pylori is a gram-negative spiral bacterium that colonizes the gastric
    epithelium. Infection is acquired in childhood and persists lifelong if
    untreated. Approximately 1-3% of infected individuals eventually develop
    gastric cancer, with risk modified by bacterial virulence factors, host
    genetics, and environmental factors including diet.

    snippet: Gastric cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and infection with Helicobacter pylori and EBV, smoking and a salt-heavy diet have been shown to be risk factors for the development of gastric cancer.
    explanation: This abstract identifies H. pylori infection as a risk factor for gastric cancer, supporting the infectious etiology noted here.

pathophysiology:
- name: CagA-Mediated Oncogenic Signaling
  description: >-
    The cagA gene encodes the CagA oncoprotein, a major H. pylori virulence
    factor injected into host cells via a type IV secretion system. CagA
    is phosphorylated by host kinases and activates SHP-2, disrupting
    cell polarity, promoting proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis.
    CagA-positive strains confer higher cancer risk.

  description: >-
    VacA (vacuolating cytotoxin A) is a pore-forming toxin that induces
    vacuolation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in epithelial
    cells. It also suppresses T cell function, allowing bacterial persistence.
    Different VacA alleles (s1/s2, m1/m2) confer different cancer risk.

- name: Chronic Inflammation (Correa Cascade)
  description: >-
    H. pylori induces chronic gastritis with infiltration of neutrophils,
    lymphocytes, and macrophages. Persistent inflammation generates reactive
    oxygen and nitrogen species that cause DNA damage. Over decades, this
    leads to atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and
    ultimately adenocarcinoma.

    Loss of E-cadherin function through somatic mutation, promoter methylation,

    intestinal-type tumors. E-cadherin loss disrupts cell-cell adhesion and
    activates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, promoting invasion.

biochemical:
- name: H. pylori Testing
  notes: >-
    H. pylori infection can be detected by urea breath test, stool antigen,
    serology, or biopsy-based tests. Serology may remain positive after
    eradication. All gastric cancer patients should have H. pylori status
    assessed.
- name: Serum Pepsinogen
  notes: >-
    Low serum pepsinogen I and low pepsinogen I/II ratio indicate gastric
    atrophy and increased cancer risk. Used as a screening marker in
    high-incidence populations, particularly Japan.

  - name: Autosomal Dominant
  notes: >-
    Somatic CDH1 alterations (mutation, deletion, methylation) occur in
    approximately 50% of diffuse-type gastric cancers. Germline CDH1 mutations
    cause hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome with lifetime
    risk greater than 70%.
- name: TP53

  notes: >-
    TP53 mutations occur in approximately 30-50% of gastric cancers,
    particularly intestinal type. More common in advanced-stage disease.

  notes: >-
    RHOA mutations occur in approximately 15-25% of diffuse-type gastric

    associated with EBV or microsatellite instability.
treatments:
- name: H. pylori Eradication
  description: >-
    Triple or quadruple therapy to eradicate H. pylori reduces gastric
    cancer risk, particularly when given before development of intestinal
    metaplasia. Also reduces risk of metachronous gastric cancer after
    endoscopic resection of early tumors.
