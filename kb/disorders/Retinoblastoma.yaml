description: >-
  Retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric malignancy arising from the nuclear layer of
  the retina, representing the paradigmatic example of the two-hit hypothesis of
  tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Biallelic loss of RB1 function is required
  for tumorigenesis. In hereditary cases (40%), a germline RB1 mutation is inherited
  and a somatic second hit occurs, leading to bilateral/multifocal tumors and
  increased risk of secondary malignancies. In sporadic cases (60%), both RB1
  alleles are inactivated somatically in a single retinal cell.

has_subtypes:
- name: Hereditary Retinoblastoma
  description: >-
    Caused by germline RB1 mutation (first hit) present in all cells, with somatic
    loss of the remaining allele in retinal cells. Typically bilateral or multifocal.
    Patients have 50% chance of passing mutation to offspring and increased lifetime
    risk of secondary malignancies including osteosarcoma.

    snippet: "In the dominantly inherited form, one mutation is inherited via the germinal cells and the second occurs in somatic cells."
    explanation: Knudson's analysis established that hereditary retinoblastoma involves germline inheritance of the first mutation.
- name: Sporadic Retinoblastoma
  description: >-
    Both RB1 alleles are inactivated by somatic mutations in a single retinal
    precursor cell. Typically unilateral and unifocal. No increased risk of
    secondary malignancies and no familial transmission unless mosaicism present.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:5279523
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In the nonhereditary form, both mutations occur in somatic cells."
    explanation: Knudson established that sporadic retinoblastoma requires two somatic mutations in the same cell.
pathophysiology:
- name: RB1 Tumor Suppressor Inactivation
  description: >-
    The RB1 gene encodes the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), a critical regulator of
    the cell cycle. Biallelic RB1 loss removes the constraint on E2F transcription
    factors, allowing uncontrolled progression through the G1/S checkpoint.
    Retinoblastoma exemplifies Knudson's two-hit hypothesis: in hereditary cases,
    one mutation is inherited and the second is somatic; in sporadic cases, both
    mutations occur somatically in the same cell.

- name: Loss of Cell Cycle Checkpoint Control
  description: >-
    pRB normally binds and inhibits E2F transcription factors during G1 phase.
    When pRB is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases or functionally lost,
    E2F is released to activate genes required for S-phase entry, including
    cyclins, DNA replication factors, and proliferative genes.

  description: >-
    Loss of pRB-mediated cell cycle control results in constitutive E2F activity,
    driving retinal progenitor cells through repeated rounds of DNA replication
    and cell division. This uncontrolled proliferation leads to tumor formation.

  notes: >-
    Molecular testing identifies RB1 mutations including point mutations, small
    insertions/deletions, large deletions, and promoter hypermethylation. Testing
    is essential for genetic counseling and surveillance of family members.
genetic:
- name: RB1
  association: Germline and Somatic Mutations
  inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
  notes: >-
    RB1 (13q14.2) encodes the retinoblastoma protein, the first tumor suppressor
    gene identified. Loss-of-function mutations include nonsense, frameshift, splice
    site, and large deletions. Germline mutations are present in 40% of cases.
    Hereditary retinoblastoma follows autosomal dominant inheritance with high
    but incomplete penetrance (approximately 90%).
