description: >-
  A chronic inflammatory liver disease characterized by interface hepatitis,
  hypergammaglobulinemia, and circulating autoantibodies. Without treatment,
  progresses to cirrhosis. Classified into type 1 (ANA/SMA positive) and
  type 2 (anti-LKM1/anti-LC1 positive).
pathophysiology:
- name: T Cell-Mediated Hepatocyte Destruction
  description: >-
    Autoreactive CD4+ T cells recognize liver autoantigens and orchestrate
    the immune attack. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells directly kill hepatocytes
    expressing aberrant MHC class II molecules.

    snippet: >-
      SepSecS-specific CD4+ T cell clones were found in patients with AIH who were
      anti-SLA-positive and anti-SLA-negative, and, to a lesser extent, in patients
      with non-AIH liver diseases and in healthy individuals. SepSecS-specific T cell
      clones from patients with AIH produced IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10, targeted multiple
      SepSecS epitopes, and, in one patient, were clonally expanded in both blood and
      liver biopsy.
    explanation: >-
      Demonstrates that autoreactive CD4+ T cells targeting the liver autoantigen SepSecS
      are present and clonally expanded in AIH patients, producing inflammatory cytokines
      and infiltrating liver tissue.
- name: Autoantibody Production
  description: >-
    Characteristic autoantibodies include ANA, SMA (anti-actin), anti-LKM1
    (anti-CYP2D6), and anti-SLA. While useful for diagnosis, their direct
    pathogenic role is uncertain.

      The anti-SepSecS mAbs isolated were primarily IgG1, affinity-matured compared
      with their germline versions, and recognized at least 3 nonoverlapping epitopes.
    explanation: >-
      Shows that anti-SLA/SepSecS autoantibodies in AIH undergo affinity maturation and
      class-switching to IgG1, indicating an adaptive B cell response with germinal center
      involvement.

    snippet: >-
      Autoreactive B cells can promote autoimmunity through antigen presentation to
      autoreactive T cells, production of autoantibodies, generation of cytokines
      promoting T cell activation and differentiation, and inhibition of regulatory
      T cells and B cells.
    explanation: >-
      Highlights multiple mechanisms by which B cells and autoantibodies contribute to
      AIH pathogenesis beyond simple diagnostic markers.
- name: Regulatory T Cell Deficiency
  description: >-
    Impaired function and reduced numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs)
    fail to suppress autoreactive T cells, allowing ongoing liver damage.

      promoting T cell activation and differentiation, and inhibition of regulatory
      T cells and B cells.
    explanation: >-
      Indicates that B cells in AIH can actively inhibit regulatory T cells, contributing
      to the loss of immune tolerance and allowing autoreactive T cell expansion.

    snippet: >-
      Fine-mapping analysis further identified position 67 where phenylalanine of the
      HLA-B molecule was significantly associated with AIH (p = 3.39×10-139), at the
      peptide binding groove.
    explanation: >-
      Demonstrates that specific HLA class I alleles, particularly HLA-B residues at the
      peptide binding groove, are strongly associated with AIH susceptibility, supporting
      the role of antigen presentation in disease pathogenesis.

    snippet: >-
      A total of 588 HLA variants were significantly associated with AIH. Stepwise
      conditional analysis revealed the strongest allele was in the HLA-B gene
      (HLA-B*35:01, p = 8.17×10-304; OR = 7.32), with additional independent signals
      at HLA-B*08:01 (p = 1.35 × 10-33; OR = 4.26) and rs7765379 (p = 5.08 × 10-18;
      OR = 1.66).
    explanation: >-
      Identifies HLA-B*35:01 as the strongest genetic risk factor for AIH type 1 in Han
      Chinese populations, with an odds ratio of 7.32, highlighting the critical role of
      MHC class I in disease susceptibility.
