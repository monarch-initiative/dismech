    snippet: Placental aromatization of androgens protects the female fetus against the virilizing action of fetal androgens. After birth, the dual effect of aromatase deficiency, excessive androgens, and insufficient estrogens is responsible for a variable clinical picture.
    explanation: The abstract explains that aromatase deficiency has implications from birth through adolescence, with effects noticeable from early childhood due to the imbalance of androgens and estrogens. This supports the statement that aromatase deficiency impacts this age range.

    snippet: Aromatase, a key enzyme in estrogen synthesis, is tissue-specifically regulated in various tissues and plays an important role through endocrine and intracrine estrogen production in various physiological functions. Therefore, aromatase deficiency caused crucial impairments of physiological functions in the gonadal tissues as well as extra-gonadal tissues.
    explanation: This reference details the crucial role of aromatase and how its deficiency, caused by lack of function due to gene mutations, leads to significant physiological impairments.

      ovarian failure.
    explanation: This reference discusses aromatase deficiency and alludes to hormonal
      imbalances related to it, suggesting that hormone replacement therapy, specifically
      estrogen replacement, is relevant for managing symptoms.

    snippet: The estradiol replacement treatment leads to a complete epiphyseal closure and to the skeletal maturation.
    explanation: The statement claims that estrogen replacement therapy corrects estrogen deficiency and supports bone health. The literature provided supports this by indicating that estradiol replacement leads to skeletal maturation.

    snippet: The overall goal of pubertal sex hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in
      girls is not only about development of secondary sexual characteristics, but
      also to establish an adult endocrine and metabolic milieu.
    explanation: This confirms that estrogen replacement therapy aids in normal sexual
      development.

    snippet: Findings from estrogen-resistant and aromatase-deficient men have provided
      important insights into the role of estrogen in the male skeleton during growth.
    explanation: The study elaborates on the role of estrogen in bone health, using
      data from aromatase-deficient subjects to underline its significance.

    supports: NO_EVIDENCE
    snippet: Diagnosis of the condition is supported by the presence of unfused epiphyses
      and undetectable serum estradiol levels; the condition can be further substantiated
      by genetic sequencing of CYP19A1. Transdermal estradiol treatment at a daily
      dose of about 25 microg might be adequate for lifelong replacement therapy.
    explanation: The literature does not mention surgical management as a treatment
      for aromatase deficiency. Instead, it suggests hormonal replacement therapy
      as the primary treatment.

    snippet: Transgender individuals are those whose gender identity differs from that recorded at birth...clinicians can provide hormone therapy (HT) to bring sex hormone levels to the range associated with the patient''s gender identity.
    explanation: This literature discusses hormone therapy for transgender individuals but does not specifically address surgical management for ambiguous genitalia or other anatomical abnormalities in the context of aromatase deficiency.
