name: Arsenic Poisoning
description: >-
  Arsenic poisoning (arsenicosis) is a toxic condition caused by acute or chronic
  exposure to inorganic arsenic, a metalloid found naturally in groundwater and
  soil and encountered through contaminated drinking water, occupational sources
  (mining, smelting, pesticide manufacturing), and certain traditional medicines.
  Acute arsenic ingestion causes severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage, cardiovascular
  collapse, and multi-organ failure. Chronic exposure produces a characteristic
  constellation of dermatological changes (hyperpigmentation, keratoses), peripheral
  neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, and increased cancer risk. Arsenic disrupts cellular
  function through inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase and other sulfhydryl-
  dependent enzymes, uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation by substituting for
  phosphate (arsenolysis), and generating reactive oxygen species. Endemic arsenicosis
  affects tens of millions in Bangladesh, West Bengal, and other regions with
  naturally high groundwater arsenic. Treatment of acute poisoning relies on
  chelation therapy with dimercaprol (BAL) or succimer (DMSA), while chronic
  arsenicosis management focuses on exposure cessation and symptomatic care.

parents:
- heavy metal poisoning
has_subtypes:
- name: Acute Arsenic Poisoning
  description: >-
    Acute arsenic poisoning from ingestion of large doses of inorganic arsenic,
    typically from intentional or accidental ingestion. Presents with severe
    gastroenteritis (rice-water diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting), cardiovascular
    collapse, QTc prolongation, seizures, encephalopathy, and multi-organ failure.
    The lethal dose of arsenic trioxide is approximately 100-300 mg in adults.
- name: Chronic Arsenic Poisoning (Arsenicosis)
  description: >-
    Chronic arsenicosis from prolonged low-level exposure, primarily through
    contaminated drinking water exceeding the WHO guideline of 10 mcg/L. Endemic
    in Bangladesh, West Bengal (India), parts of Southeast Asia, and South America.
    Characterized by progressive dermatological changes (melanosis, keratoses),
    peripheral neuropathy, hepatic fibrosis, and markedly increased cancer risk.
    The WHO considers chronic arsenicosis a major global public health concern.
pathophysiology:
- name: Gastrointestinal Absorption and Transport
  description: >-
    Arsenic enters the body primarily through the gastrointestinal tract.
    Pentavalent arsenic (As(V)) is absorbed via sodium-dependent phosphate
    transporters (NaPiIIb) in the small intestine through a saturable,
    carrier-mediated process that is competitively inhibited by phosphate.
    Trivalent arsenic (As(III)) is absorbed via aquaglyceroporins (AQP3,
    AQP7, AQP10) and glucose transporters (GLUT2, GLUT5). The gut microbiome
    modulates arsenic bioavailability: sulfate-reducing bacteria produce
    thiolated arsenic species that are more toxic and more readily absorbed,
    and salivary/colonic microorganisms increase small intestinal absorption
    1.2-2.7 fold.

  description: >-
    Inorganic arsenic undergoes hepatic biotransformation via the Challenger
    pathway. Arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT) catalyzes
    sequential methylation using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl
    donor, producing monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA).
    Glutathione-S-transferase omega (hGST-O) functions as MMA(V) reductase.
    While historically considered a detoxification pathway, the intermediate
    trivalent methylated species (MMA(III)) is more toxic than inorganic arsenic.
    Individual variation in AS3MT activity and polymorphisms influences
    susceptibility. Urinary arsenic speciation (typically 10-30% iAs, 10-20%
    MMA, 60-80% DMA) reflects methylation efficiency and disease risk.

    Arsenic causes nephrotoxicity primarily targeting proximal tubular cells
    through mitochondrial dysfunction, NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK activation,
    ROS production, and glutathione depletion. Dysregulated autophagy
    (early induction followed by impaired autophagic flux, especially in
    females via estrogen-mediated mechanisms) contributes to cell death.
    The SIRT1/PINK1/mitophagy axis is disrupted. Chronic exposure leads
    to tubular dilation, basement membrane disruption, collagen deposition,
    decreased eGFR, and progressive chronic kidney disease.
