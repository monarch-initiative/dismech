pathophysiology:

  description: >
    Enhanced perception of normal gut sensations leads to pain and
    discomfort. Lowered pain thresholds in response to balloon
    distension. Central sensitization contributes.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "A significant 3.5-fold increase in median numbers of TRPV1-immunoreactive
      fibres was found in biopsies from IBS patients compared with controls (p<0.0001)."
    explanation: TRPV1-expressing sensory nerve fibers are significantly
      increased in IBS, providing a molecular basis for visceral
      hypersensitivity.
  - reference: PMID:18252749
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In multivariate regression analysis, only TRPV1-immuno-reactive fibres
      (p = 0.005) and mast cells (p = 0.008) were significantly related to the abdominal
      pain score."
    explanation: TRPV1 nerve fiber density directly correlates with abdominal
      pain severity in IBS patients.
  - reference: PMID:17241857
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Mediators from IBS patients, but not controls, markedly enhanced the
      firing of mesenteric nerves (14.7 +/- 3.2 imp/sec vs 2.8 +/- 1.5 imp/sec; P
      < .05) and stimulated mobilization of Ca(2+) in dorsal root ganglia neurons
      (29% +/- 4% vs 11% +/- 4%; P < .05)."
    explanation: Mucosal mediators from IBS patients directly excite visceral
      sensory neurons, demonstrating a mechanism for visceral hypersensitivity.
  - reference: PMID:17241857
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "On average, 64% of dorsal root ganglia responsive to mediators were
      capsaicin-sensitive, known to mediate nociception."
    explanation: The majority of sensory neurons activated by IBS mucosal
      mediators are nociceptive, explaining the pain phenotype.
- name: Gut Dysmotility
  description: >
    Altered intestinal motility patterns with either accelerated
    (diarrhea-predominant) or delayed (constipation-predominant)
    transit. Abnormal colonic contractions.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Gut Motility
    term:
      id: GO:0030432
      label: peristalsis
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:15100164
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "5-HT release from enterochromaffin (EC) cells initiates peristaltic,
      secretory, vasodilatory, vagal and nociceptive reflexes."
    explanation: Serotonin from enterochromaffin cells is a key regulator of
      intestinal motility and peristaltic reflexes.
  - reference: PMID:15100164
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "5-HT directly and indirectly affects intestinal motor and secretory
      function and abnormalities may lead to either constipation or diarrhea."
    explanation: Dysregulated serotonin signaling can account for both IBS-D and
      IBS-C subtypes through effects on motility.
- name: Gut-Brain Axis Dysfunction
  description: >
    Bidirectional communication between gut and brain is disrupted.
    Stress and psychological factors modulate gut function through
    autonomic and neuroendocrine pathways.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Nervous System Process
    term:
      id: GO:0050877
      label: nervous system process
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:37048642
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Although the pathophysiology of IBS has not been fully elucidated, it
      involves dysregulation of communication between the brain and gut (brain-gut
      axis) which is associated with alterations in intestinal motility, gut permeability,
      visceral hypersensitivity and gut microbiota composition."
    explanation: The gut-brain axis is a central organizing principle in IBS
      pathophysiology, integrating multiple dysfunctional mechanisms.
  - reference: PMID:15100164
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Ongoing, bidirectional brain-gut interactions involving 5-HT pathways
      occur that significantly influence the effector systems."
    explanation: Serotonin pathways mediate bidirectional brain-gut
      communication in IBS.
- name: Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction
  description: >
    Increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut) allows translocation
    of luminal antigens, triggering low-grade immune activation.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:17593135
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "While a subgroup of patients with IBS appears to have evidence of increased
      intestinal permeability, improvements in the methods and validation are key
      to further research in this field in order to better understand intestinal barrier
      functions in IBS."
    explanation: A subset of IBS patients demonstrate measurable increases in
      intestinal permeability, though the exact prevalence varies by
      methodology.
  - reference: PMID:19595511
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Approximately 39% of diarrhea-predominant IBS patients had increased
      intestinal membrane permeability as measured by the lactulose/mannitol ratio."
    explanation: Nearly 40% of IBS-D patients show objective evidence of barrier
      dysfunction using validated permeability testing.
  - reference: PMID:19595511
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "A subset of D-IBS patients had increased intestinal membrane permeability
      that was associated with an increased FBDSI score and increased hypersensitivity
      to visceral and thermal nociceptive pain stimuli."
    explanation: Barrier dysfunction in IBS-D correlates with more severe
      symptoms and heightened visceral sensitivity, linking permeability to
      clinical phenotype.
- name: Immune Activation and Mast Cell Degranulation
  description: >
    Low-grade mucosal immune activation with increased mast cell density
    and degranulation near enteric nerves. Mast cell mediators including
    histamine and tryptase excite visceral sensory neurons, contributing
    to pain and hypersensitivity.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: Mast Cell Activation
    term:
      id: GO:0045576
      label: mast cell activation
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:17241857
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "IBS-dependent nerve firing and Ca(2+) mobilization were correlated with
      the area of the colonic lamina propria occupied by mast cells (r = 0.74; P <
      .01, and r = 0.78; P < .01, respectively)."
    explanation: Mast cell density directly correlates with sensory neuron
      activation in IBS, establishing a quantitative relationship.
  - reference: PMID:17241857
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Mucosal mast cell mediators from IBS patients excite rat nociceptive
      visceral sensory nerves. These results provide new insights into the mechanism
      underlying visceral hypersensitivity in IBS."
    explanation: Mast cell mediators from IBS patients directly activate
      nociceptive neurons, providing a mechanistic link to pain.
  - reference: PMID:18252749
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Substance P-immunoreactive fibres (p = 0.01), total nerve fibres (PGP9.5)
      (p = 0.002), mast cells (c-kit) (p = 0.02) and lymphocytes (CD3) (p = 0.03)
      were also significantly increased in the IBS group."
    explanation: Both mast cells and immune cells are increased in IBS mucosa,
      indicating low-grade immune activation.
- name: Microbiome Dysbiosis
  description: >
    Altered composition and function of gut microbiota may contribute
    to symptoms. Post-infectious IBS follows gastroenteritis in
    some patients.

    snippet: "It has a prevalence of 10 to 25% in the United States and has a high
      disease burden, as evidenced by reduced quality of life, decreased work productivity
      and increased healthcare utilization and costs."
    explanation: IBS is a common disorder with substantial public health impact,
      emphasizing the importance of understanding pathophysiological mechanisms
      including microbiome alterations.

    snippet: "Increased TRPV1 nerve fibres are observed in IBS, together with a low-grade
      inflammatory response. The increased TRPV1 nerve fibres may contribute to visceral
      hypersensitivity and pain in IBS, and provide a novel therapeutic target."
    explanation: TRPV1-expressing nerve fibers are increased in IBS and directly
      linked to abdominal pain severity.

    explanation: Mast cell mediators, particularly histamine and proteases,
      directly excite nociceptive neurons to produce abdominal pain in IBS.
