name: Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma
description: >-
  Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are rare neuroendocrine tumors arising
  from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma) or extra-adrenal
  sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia (paraganglioma). Approximately 40% of PPGLs
  are hereditary, caused by germline mutations in over 20 susceptibility genes including
  SDHx subunits (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD), VHL, RET, NF1, MAX, and TMEM127. PPGLs may
  be catecholamine-secreting, causing paroxysmal hypertension, headaches, sweating,
  and palpitations. Understanding the genetic basis has enabled surveillance, early
  detection, and emerging targeted therapies for this heterogeneous tumor group.

has_subtypes:
- name: Pheochromocytoma
  description: >-
    Tumors arising from the adrenal medulla chromaffin cells. Most common site
    of catecholamine-producing paraganglioma. Usually unilateral but bilateral
    in hereditary syndromes.
- name: Sympathetic Paraganglioma
  description: >-
    Extra-adrenal tumors arising from sympathetic ganglia along the paravertebral
    axis (thorax, abdomen, pelvis). Often catecholamine-secreting. SDHB mutations
    associated with high malignancy risk.
- name: Parasympathetic Paraganglioma
  description: >-
    Head and neck paragangliomas arising from parasympathetic ganglia (carotid
    body, jugulotympanic, vagal). Usually non-secreting. SDHD mutations common.
pathophysiology:
- name: Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex Dysfunction
  description: >-
    Mutations in SDHx genes (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2) impair mitochondrial
    complex II function, leading to succinate accumulation. Succinate acts as an
    oncometabolite, inhibiting alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and
    causing pseudohypoxia and epigenetic dysregulation.

  - reference: PMID:33112834
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "SDHx mutations lead to the accumulation of succinate, which acts as an oncometabolite by inhibiting iron(II)
      and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases thereby regulating the cell's hypoxic response and epigenetic processes."
    explanation: This abstract connects SDHx mutations to succinate accumulation and dioxygenase inhibition, matching 
      the described mechanism.

    SDHx and VHL mutations cause constitutive stabilization of hypoxia-inducible
    factors (HIF1/2) under normoxic conditions. This pseudohypoxic state activates
    genes promoting angiogenesis, glycolysis, and cell survival, driving
    tumorigenesis.

  description: >-
    Secreting PPGLs produce excess catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine,
    dopamine), causing characteristic symptoms. The catecholamine profile provides
    clues to underlying genetics: norepinephrine-predominant suggests SDHx/VHL,
    epinephrine-predominant suggests RET/NF1.
