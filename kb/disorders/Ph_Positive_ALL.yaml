description: >-
  Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) is
  characterized by the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation creating the BCR-ABL1 fusion
  oncogene, occurring in 20-30% of adult ALL and 3-5% of pediatric ALL. The constitutively
  active BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase drives leukemic transformation of B-lymphoid
  progenitors. Historically carrying a dismal prognosis, the addition of tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, ponatinib) to chemotherapy has transformed
  outcomes, with cure rates now approaching those of Ph-negative ALL when combined
  with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

- name: BCR-ABL1 Fusion Oncogene in Lymphoid Progenitors
  description: >-
    The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation fuses BCR on chromosome 22 with ABL1 on
    chromosome 9, creating the Philadelphia chromosome. In ALL, the fusion typically
    produces the p190 BCR-ABL1 protein (compared to p210 in CML), which has enhanced
    transforming activity in lymphoid cells. The fusion kinase is constitutively
    active, driving proliferation and survival signaling.

    explanation: This abstract directly links Ph+ ALL to the BCR::ABL1 fusion from t(9;22), matching the described mechanism.

- name: Constitutive Signaling Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    BCR-ABL1 activates RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways
    independently of normal growth factor regulation. This drives uncontrolled
    proliferation and confers resistance to apoptosis, enabling leukemic
    transformation of B-lymphoid progenitors.

  description: >-
    BCR-ABL1 signaling interferes with normal B-cell development, arresting
    cells at an immature lymphoblast stage. The resulting cells express
    B-lineage markers (CD19, CD22) but lack complete B-cell maturation.
    IKZF1 (Ikaros) deletions, common in Ph+ ALL, further impair B-cell development.

  description: >-
    BCR-ABL1 activates PI3K-AKT signaling, phosphorylating and inactivating

    apoptotic signals and contributes to the aggressive clinical behavior
    of Ph+ ALL.

biochemical:
- name: BCR-ABL1 Fusion Detection
  notes: >-
    RT-PCR or FISH detects BCR-ABL1 fusion. Most Ph+ ALL cases have the p190
    BCR-ABL1 (e1a2 junction) though some express p210. Quantitative PCR
    monitors minimal residual disease and guides therapy.
- name: Immunophenotyping
  notes: >-
    Flow cytometry shows precursor B-cell phenotype (CD19+, CD10+, CD34+,
    TdT+) with variable expression of myeloid markers. CD25 and aberrant
    myeloid antigen expression may be more common in Ph+ ALL.
genetic:
- name: BCR-ABL1 Fusion
  association: Defining Genetic Lesion
  notes: >-
    The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation creates BCR-ABL1 fusion. Ph+ ALL
    typically expresses p190 BCR-ABL1 (minor breakpoint). The fusion kinase
    is constitutively active and is the primary driver of leukemia.
    Targetable with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
- name: IKZF1 Deletion
  association: Cooperating Mutation
  notes: >-
    IKZF1 (Ikaros) deletions occur in 70-80% of Ph+ ALL and confer inferior
    prognosis. Loss of Ikaros removes a brake on proliferation and impairs
    B-cell development. Defines Ph-like ALL when BCR-ABL1 is absent.
treatments:
- name: Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor plus Chemotherapy
  description: >-
    Addition of TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib) to multi-agent chemotherapy
    dramatically improves remission rates and survival in Ph+ ALL. Dasatinib
    achieves better CNS penetration. TKIs are continued through all phases
    of treatment including maintenance.
