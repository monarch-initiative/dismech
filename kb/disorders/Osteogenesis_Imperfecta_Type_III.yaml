name: Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type III
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Osteogenesis imperfecta type III is the most severe non-lethal form of OI,
  characterized by progressive skeletal deformity, very short stature, and
  hundreds of fractures over a lifetime. Caused by dominant-negative mutations
  in COL1A1 or COL1A2, affected individuals typically require wheelchair mobility
  and have significant morbidity from skeletal complications. Sclerae may be blue
  at birth but often lighten with age. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is common.

inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
    description: >
      Autosomal dominant inheritance with de novo mutations being common.
      Rare autosomal recessive forms exist (see OI types VII-XVIII).
pathophysiology:
  - name: Dominant-Negative Collagen Defect
    description: >
      Structural mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2, typically glycine substitutions
      in the triple helical domain, produce abnormal collagen that disrupts
      fibril assembly. The mutations are generally less severe than those
      causing type II, allowing survival but with progressive deformity.

          Point mutations resulting in the substitution of Gly residues in Gly-X-Y
          amino acid triplets of the triple helical domain of the alpha 1(I) or alpha
          2(I) chains are the most frequent mutations. They interrupt the repetitive
          Gly-X-Y structure that is mandatory for the formation of a stable triple helix.
        explanation: >-
          Establishes glycine substitutions as the predominant mutation mechanism in
          OI with structural collagen defects, applicable to types II-IV.
genetic:
  - name: COL1A1/COL1A2 Mutations
    association: Causative
    notes: >
      Predominantly glycine substitutions in COL1A1 or COL1A2. Mutations in
      COL1A1 tend to produce more severe phenotypes than equivalent mutations
      in COL1A2 because the collagen trimer contains two alpha1 chains and
      one alpha2 chain. Mutation position along the helix affects severity.

        snippet: >-
          The severity of the clinical phenotype appears to be related to the type of
          mutation, its location in the alpha chain, the surrounding amino acid
          sequences, and the level of expression of the mutant allele.
