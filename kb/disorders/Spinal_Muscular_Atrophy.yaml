name: Spinal Muscular Atrophy
description: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular
  disorder caused by homozygous deletion or mutation of the SMN1 gene, resulting in
  progressive degeneration of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal
  cord. Disease severity inversely correlates with SMN2 copy number, which partially
  compensates for SMN1 loss. The advent of disease-modifying therapies including
  nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam has transformed the treatment
  landscape, particularly when administered presymptomatically.

    independent ambulation but may lose this ability over time.
