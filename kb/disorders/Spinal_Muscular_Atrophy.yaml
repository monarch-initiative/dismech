has_subtypes:
- name: SMA Type 1 (Werdnig-Hoffmann)
  description: Most severe, onset before 6 months, never sit independently, death usually by age 2.
- name: SMA Type 2
  description: Intermediate, onset 6-18 months, can sit but never walk independently.
- name: SMA Type 3 (Kugelberg-Welander)
  description: Milder, onset after 18 months, can walk but may lose ability later.
- name: SMA Type 4
  description: Adult onset, mildest form, normal lifespan with mild weakness.
pathophysiology:
- name: SMN Protein Deficiency
  description: >
    Homozygous deletion or mutation of SMN1 gene causes deficiency of survival motor neuron protein.
    SMN2 gene produces some functional protein but mostly truncated due to exon 7 skipping.
    SMN protein is essential for motor neuron survival and function.

    snippet: "Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterised by degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons, atrophy of skeletal muscles, and generalised weakness. It is caused by homozygous disruption of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene by deletion, conversion, or mutation."
    explanation: Lancet review confirms SMN1 gene disruption causes SMA with motor neuron degeneration.
  downstream:
  - target: Motor Neuron Degeneration
    description: Reduced SMN impairs spliceosome assembly and selectively injures alpha motor neurons.
- name: Motor Neuron Degeneration
  description: >
    Loss of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord leads to
    progressive denervation of skeletal muscles. Proximal muscles are more severely
    affected than distal muscles.

    strength, and airway clearance, predisposing to respiratory decompensation.
  downstream:
  - target: Respiratory Failure
    description: Progressive ventilatory muscle weakness culminates in chronic or acute respiratory failure.
