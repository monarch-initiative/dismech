name: Multiple Synostoses Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized
  by progressive joint fusion (synostosis) affecting proximal interphalangeal joints,
  carpal and tarsal bones, and the cervical spine. It is caused by mutations in genes
  involved in BMP signaling, primarily NOG (encoding noggin, a BMP antagonist) and
  GDF5 (encoding growth/differentiation factor 5, a BMP ligand). The disorder
  typically presents in childhood with progressive stiffness and conductive hearing
  loss from stapes fixation.

pathophysiology:
  - name: BMP Signaling Dysregulation
    description: >
      NOG mutations reduce noggin's ability to antagonize BMPs (particularly BMP2,
      BMP4, and GDF5), leading to excessive BMP signaling in developing joints.
      This causes progressive ossification and fusion of joints that would normally
      remain separate. GDF5 mutations cause gain-of-function changes that similarly
      enhance BMP pathway activity in joint development.

          The SYNS1 mutation abolished, and the SYM1 mutations reduced, the

          cells.
        explanation: >-
          Shows that SYNS1-causing NOG mutations abolish functional noggin
          dimer secretion, explaining the loss of BMP antagonism.

        snippet: >-
          this gain of function is caused by strongly reduced affinity of
          GDF5-S94N to the BMP/GDF antagonist noggin and the consequential lack
          of noggin inhibition.
        explanation: >-

          resulting in excessive BMP signaling during chondrogenesis.

    description: >
      Normal joint formation requires interzone specification and subsequent
      cavitation. Excess BMP signaling, due to loss of noggin antagonism,
      disrupts this process, leading to failure of joint space formation
      and progressive synostosis.
