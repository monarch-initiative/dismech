description: 'Citrin deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in SLC25A13,
  which encodes citrin (aspartate- glutamate carrier 2, AGC2), an inner mitochondrial membrane transporter and core component
  of the hepatic malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). Loss of citrin impairs export of mitochondrial aspartate to the cytosol and
  cytosolic NADH-to-mitochondrial NADH transfer needed to regenerate cytosolic NAD+, producing a hepatocellular energy and
  redox crisis that secondarily perturbs carbohydrate handling, de novo lipogenesis, fatty-acid oxidation, and ammonia detoxification.
  The disease manifests in age-dependent stages: neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD), failure to thrive and dyslipidemia
  (FTTDCD), and adult-onset hyperammonemic encephalopathy (CTLN2). Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation with carbohydrate
  restriction is the mainstay of therapy. Liver transplantation is reserved for severe or refractory cases.

    snippet: MCT supplementation with a diet containing minimal carbohydrates is recommended promptly after the diagnosis.
    explanation: Supports early and combined MCT plus carbohydrate restriction as the recommended approach.
- name: Avoidance of fructose and glycerol infusions
  description: 'Intravenous infusion of glycerol- and fructose-containing osmotic agents is contraindicated and potentially
    lethal in citrin deficiency. These sugars exacerbate the GAPDH-step metabolic block and worsen hepatocyte ATP depletion
    under conditions of impaired MAS function.

  notes: 'This is a critical safety consideration. Healthcare providers must be aware that standard fructose- or glycerol-containing
    IV solutions can precipitate fatal metabolic crisis in citrin deficiency patients.

- name: Liver transplantation
  description: 'Liver transplantation is reserved for patients with severe or refractory CTLN2, recurrent hyperammonemic episodes
    unresponsive to medical management, or liver failure. In the Japanese nationwide study of 222 patients, transplantation
    was performed in only 4 patients (1 NICCD, 3 CTLN2) with good response thereafter.

    snippet: NICCD is generally not severe, and clinical manifestations are often resolved by age one year with appropriate
      treatment, although liver failure may still occur; liver transplantation has been required in rare instances.
    explanation: Confirms liver transplantation as a rare but necessary intervention.
- name: Supportive care during acute hyperammonemia
  description: 'Acute hyperammonemic episodes in CTLN2 require emergency supportive management including ammonia-lowering
    therapies, protein restriction, and metabolic stabilization. Care must avoid glucose and fructose-containing solutions
    which can worsen the metabolic crisis.

- name: Newborn screening
  description: 'Citrin deficiency is detectable by newborn screening via tandem mass spectrometry using elevated citrulline
    as the primary marker. However, dried blood spot citrulline can be borderline or normal, leading to false negatives. Second-tier
    NGS-based genetic testing with specific detection of hotspot variants like IVS16ins3kb has been implemented to improve
    sensitivity. In a Hong Kong study, two citrullinemia type II cases would have been missed without molecular second-tier
    testing.

    explanation: Quantifies the performance improvement from adding NGS second-tier screening.
- name: Pharmacotherapy for hyperammonemia
  description: 'Ammonia-lowering agents such as sodium benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate may be used during acute hyperammonemic
    crises in CTLN2, along with arginine supplementation to support residual urea cycle function.

- name: Genetic counseling
  description: 'Genetic counseling for affected families is important given the autosomal recessive inheritance, high carrier
    rates in East Asian populations, and the availability of carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis. Early genetic diagnosis
    guides optimal dietary management and prevents diagnostic delays.

    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: Our study clarified the genetic etiology of the four infants, expanded the variant spectrum of SLC25A13, and
      provided a basis for genetic counseling of the family.
    explanation: Directly states the importance of genetic counseling based on molecular diagnosis.
notes: 'Citrin deficiency represents a paradigm of mitochondrial hepatopathy where the fundamental defect is a transport protein
  rather than an enzyme. The disease is best understood as an energy/redox hepatopathy rather than a simple urea cycle enzyme
  deficiency. The characteristic food preference for protein and lipid-rich foods with carbohydrate aversion is a physiological
  adaptation. Carrier rates are high in East Asian populations (1:42-1:65 in Japan), making it an important consideration
  in newborn screening programs in these regions. Fructose and glycerol infusions are strictly contraindicated.
