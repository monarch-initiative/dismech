description: >
  The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of lysosomal storage disorders caused
  by deficiency of enzymes required for degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).
  Undegraded GAGs accumulate in lysosomes and extracellular matrix, causing
  progressive multisystem disease. Skeletal manifestations (dysostosis multiplex)
  are a unifying feature across all MPS types, including vertebral abnormalities,
  joint contractures, short stature, and characteristic radiographic changes.
  Enzyme replacement therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are
  available for several subtypes.

    All MPS types are autosomal recessive except MPS II (Hunter syndrome),
    which is X-linked recessive.
pathophysiology:
- name: Lysosomal GAG Accumulation
  description: >
    Deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes leads to accumulation of
    undegraded glycosaminoglycans (dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate,
    keratan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, or hyaluronan depending on
    the subtype). GAGs accumulate in lysosomes of connective tissue
    cells, causing cellular dysfunction and tissue/organ damage. In
    bone and cartilage, GAG storage disrupts endochondral ossification,
    growth plate organization, and articular cartilage integrity.

- name: Secondary Inflammatory Response
  description: >
    Accumulated GAGs and their fragments activate toll-like receptors
    (TLR4) and inflammasome pathways, driving chronic inflammation
    that contributes to joint destruction, cardiac valve disease,
    and neurodegeneration. GAG-mediated inflammation amplifies
    tissue damage beyond direct storage effects.
