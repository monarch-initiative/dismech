name: Crouzon Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Crouzon syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome caused by heterozygous mutations in
  FGFR2, characterized by premature fusion of multiple cranial sutures, midface hypoplasia,
  proptosis, and hypertelorism. Unlike Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome does not involve
  limb abnormalities. It is the most common FGFR2-related craniosynostosis syndrome and
  shows significant phenotypic variability, even within families with the same mutation.

          These results underscore the allelic heterogeneity of these conditions
          and the complexity of the phenotypic consequences of FGFR2 mutations
        explanation: >-
          Demonstrates that FGFR2 mutations in Crouzon syndrome lead to complex
          phenotypic variability, supporting the concept of variable expressivity.
pathophysiology:
  - name: FGFR2 Gain-of-Function Signaling
    description: >
      Mutations in FGFR2, predominantly in the third immunoglobulin-like domain
      (Ig-III) and linker regions, cause constitutive receptor activation or
      altered ligand binding. This leads to premature osteogenic differentiation
      in cranial suture mesenchyme and suture fusion.

          we have identified 10 different mutations in the FGFR2 extracellular
          immunoglobulin III (IgIII) domain in 50% (16/32) of our Crouzon syndrome
          patients
        explanation: >-
          Confirms that FGFR2 mutations in the Ig-III domain are found in a substantial
          proportion of Crouzon syndrome patients, supporting the pathophysiology
          centered on FGFR2 dysfunction.
genetic:
  - name: FGFR2 Mutations
    association: Causative
    notes: >
      Over 40 different FGFR2 mutations have been identified. Common mutations
      include C342Y, C342R, and C342S in the Ig-III domain. Unlike Apert syndrome,
      mutations are distributed across multiple exons (exons 7, 8, 9, 10).
      Some mutations are shared with other FGFR2-related syndromes.

          Five different mutations were found including two novel (W290G, C342W)
          and two previously reported, recurrent mutations for Crouzon syndrome
          (A344A, S354C), and one new mutation for Jackson-Weiss syndrome (C342R)
        explanation: >-
          Demonstrates allelic heterogeneity with multiple different FGFR2 mutations
          causing Crouzon syndrome, including mutations in exon IIIa and IIIc.

          All mutations described so far for other craniosynostotic syndromes with
          associated limb anomalies--Jackson-Weiss, Pfeiffer, and Apert--also occur
          in the extracellular domain of FGFR2
        explanation: >-
          Confirms that Crouzon syndrome FGFR2 mutations occur in the extracellular
          domain, similar to other craniosynostosis syndromes but distinguishing it
          from those with limb involvement.
