name: HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
description: >-
  HER2-positive breast cancer is a molecularly-defined subtype of breast cancer
  characterized by amplification or overexpression of the ERBB2 (HER2/neu) gene,
  encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase. HER2 amplification occurs in approximately
  15-20% of breast cancers and historically conferred poor prognosis before the
  advent of HER2-targeted therapies. The development of trastuzumab revolutionized
  treatment and established HER2+ breast cancer as a paradigm for targeted therapy
  in solid tumors. Modern treatment includes multiple HER2-targeted agents including
  monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates.

pathophysiology:
- name: ERBB2 Gene Amplification
  description: >-
    HER2-positive breast cancer is driven by amplification of the ERBB2 gene on
    chromosome 17q12, resulting in overexpression of the HER2 receptor tyrosine
    kinase. Gene amplification typically results in 25-50 copies per cell, leading
    to massive receptor overexpression on the cell surface.

    snippet: HER2-positive breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers, is 
      characterized by its aggressive recurrence, metastasis and reduced survival.

    description: Receptor overexpression leads to ligand-independent dimerization and activation
- name: Constitutive Receptor Activation
  description: >-
    Massive HER2 overexpression promotes spontaneous receptor homodimerization and
    heterodimerization with other ERBB family members (EGFR, HER3, HER4) without
    ligand binding. This constitutive activation drives downstream signaling cascades
    promoting proliferation, survival, and invasion.

    Activated HER2 signals through PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathways,

  notes: >-
    HER2 status is determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for protein expression
    and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for gene amplification. IHC
    scores of 0-1+ are negative, 2+ is equivocal (requires FISH), and 3+ is positive.
    FISH positive is defined as HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 or average HER2 copy number ≥6.
genetic:
- name: ERBB2

  inheritance:
  - name: Somatic
  notes: >-
    ERBB2 (17q12) encodes the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase. Amplification occurs
    somatically and is not inherited. The amplicon often includes neighboring genes
    including GRB7 and TOP2A. Amplification level correlates with HER2 protein
    expression and response to HER2-targeted therapy.
