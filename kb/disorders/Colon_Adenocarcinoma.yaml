description: >-
  Colon adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of colon cancer and
  typically arises through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.
pathophysiology:
- name: Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence
  description: >-
    Stepwise progression from adenomatous polyps to invasive carcinoma drives
    colon adenocarcinoma development.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:8055224
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Molecular studies support the clinical impression that adenocarcinoma
      of the large intestine develops in stages. At the center of the pathological
      continuum between normal mucosa and invasive carcinoma is the premalignant lesion,
      the adenomatous polyp."
    explanation: The abstract describes stage-wise progression through
      adenomatous polyps.
- name: APC Loss in Intestinal Stem Cells
  description: >-
    Wnt-pathway-activating loss of APC in intestinal stem cells drives early
    neoplasia.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:19092804
    supports: PARTIAL
    evidence_source: MODEL_ORGANISM
    snippet: "Intestinal cancer is initiated by Wnt-pathway-activating mutations in
      genes such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)."
    explanation: The abstract identifies APC loss and Wnt pathway activation as
      initiating events in intestinal cancer.

    snippet: "We present the case of a 68-year-old female presented with a two-month
      history of anemia, hematochezia and abdominal pain."
    explanation: Abdominal pain is listed among presenting symptoms.

      label: surgical procedure
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35613396
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "The colonoscopic study presented a tumor in the ascending colon, which
      after surgical resection and pathological studies, turned out to be a primary
      colonoc adenosquamous carcinoma."
    explanation: The abstract describes surgical resection of a colon tumor.
