description: >-
  Colon adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of colon cancer and
  typically arises through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.
pathophysiology:
- name: Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence
  description: >-
    Stepwise progression from adenomatous polyps to invasive carcinoma drives
    colon adenocarcinoma development.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:8055224
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Molecular studies support the clinical impression that adenocarcinoma of the large intestine develops in stages. At the center of the pathological continuum between normal mucosa and invasive carcinoma is the premalignant lesion, the adenomatous polyp."
    explanation: The abstract describes stage-wise progression through adenomatous polyps.
- name: APC Loss in Intestinal Stem Cells
  description: >-
    Wnt-pathway-activating loss of APC in intestinal stem cells drives early
    neoplasia.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:19092804
    supports: PARTIAL
    evidence_source: MODEL_ORGANISM
    snippet: "Intestinal cancer is initiated by Wnt-pathway-activating mutations in genes such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)."
    explanation: The abstract identifies APC loss and Wnt pathway activation as initiating events in intestinal cancer.
