  Breast fibroadenoma is a common benign breast tumor presenting as a palpable
  breast mass, particularly in premenopausal women.
pathophysiology:
- name: Benign Fibroepithelial Tumor
  description: >-
    Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors composed of epithelial and stromal
    elements, presenting as discrete breast lumps.

    snippet: "Fibroadenoma of the breast is a common cause of a benign breast lump in premenopausal women."
    explanation: The abstract describes fibroadenoma as a common benign breast lump.
genetic:

    snippet: "Somatic mutations in exon 2 of the mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) gene have been identified in 60% of breast fibroadenomas (FAs)."
    explanation: The abstract reports frequent MED12 somatic mutations in fibroadenomas.

    snippet: "Traditionally, symptomatic fibroadenomas were treated by surgical excision, and this option should always be offered."
    explanation: The abstract states surgical excision as a traditional treatment option.
- name: Conservative Management
  description: >-
    Observation with clinical and imaging follow-up when triple-test evaluation
    is consistent with fibroadenoma.
  treatment_term:
    preferred_term: supportive care

      id: MAXO:0000950
      label: supportive care
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:11270760
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "There is increasing evidence that a conservative approach is safe and acceptable, provided the result of an adequate triple test is both negative for cancer and consistent with a fibroadenoma."
    explanation: The abstract supports conservative management in appropriate cases.
