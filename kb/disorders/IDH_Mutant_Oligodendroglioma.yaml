description: >-
  Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted, is a diffuse glioma defined by
  the combination of IDH1/IDH2 mutation and whole-arm codeletion of chromosomes 1p and
  19q. This molecular signature is the result of an unbalanced translocation t(1;19)
  (q10;p10) and is associated with distinct biology, excellent chemosensitivity, and
  favorable prognosis. The 1p/19q codeletion is mutually exclusive with TP53 and ATRX
  mutations, serving as a key diagnostic discriminator from IDH-mutant astrocytoma.
  These tumors are exquisitely sensitive to alkylating chemotherapy, particularly
  procarbazine-CCNU-vincristine (PCV) combination, with long-term survival even for
  anaplastic tumors.

has_subtypes:
- name: Oligodendroglioma Grade 2
  description: >-
    Low-grade oligodendroglioma with IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion. Characterized
    by uniform round nuclei, perinuclear halos (fried egg appearance), delicate
    branching capillaries (chicken-wire vasculature), and low mitotic activity.
    Median survival exceeds 15 years with appropriate treatment.
- name: Oligodendroglioma Grade 3 (Anaplastic)
  description: >-
    Anaplastic oligodendroglioma with IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion. Shows
    increased cellularity, mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, and/or
    necrosis. Despite high-grade features, chemosensitivity is retained and
    median survival is 10-15 years with combined chemoradiation.
pathophysiology:
- name: IDH1/2 Neomorphic Mutation
  description: >-
    Heterozygous IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutations produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG),
    an oncometabolite causing epigenetic dysregulation through inhibition of
    alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. This is an early clonal event shared
    with IDH-mutant astrocytomas.

    snippet: "This unique immune microenvironment is shaped by 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite produced by mutant IDH."
    explanation: This abstract explicitly links mutant IDH to 2-HG production, supporting the neomorphic IDH mechanism.

- name: 1p/19q Codeletion
  description: >-
    The 1p/19q codeletion results from an unbalanced translocation t(1;19)(q10;p10)
    occurring early in tumorigenesis. This leads to loss of tumor suppressor genes
    including CIC on 19q and FUBP1 on 1p. The codeletion is associated with
    oligodendroglial differentiation and exceptional chemosensitivity.

  description: >-
    Glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) results from 2-HG-mediated
    inhibition of TET enzymes and histone demethylases. This leads to widespread
    promoter hypermethylation, altered gene expression, and blocked differentiation.

    The combination of IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and CIC/FUBP1 mutations
    drives oligodendroglioma formation. These tumors retain oligodendroglial
    differentiation markers and maintain sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents,
    likely due to intact DNA damage response pathways.
