description: >
  Stargardt disease is the most common inherited macular dystrophy, affecting approximately
  1 in 8,000-10,000 individuals. It is most commonly caused by autosomal recessive mutations
  in the ABCA4 gene, encoding an ATP-binding cassette transporter critical for the visual
  cycle in photoreceptor outer segments. Dysfunction of ABCA4 leads to toxic bisretinoid
  accumulation (including A2E) within retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, causing
  progressive RPE and photoreceptor degeneration centered on the macula. Clinical
  hallmarks include bilateral central visual loss beginning in childhood or early adulthood,
  yellow-white pisciform flecks around the macula and posterior pole, macular atrophy,
  and the characteristic "dark choroid" sign on fluorescein angiography. There is no
  approved disease-modifying therapy; gene therapy and retinal cell replacement strategies
  are in clinical trials.

pathophysiology:
- name: ABCA4 dysfunction and bisretinoid accumulation
  description: >
    ABCA4 (also known as ABCR) is expressed exclusively in photoreceptor outer segment
    disc membranes, where it functions as a flippase transporting N-retinylidene-
    phosphatidylethanolamine (N-ret-PE) from the lumenal to cytoplasmic leaflet.
    This facilitates the release of all-trans retinal from disc membranes following
    phototransduction. Loss-of-function mutations in ABCA4 impair this transport,
    causing N-ret-PE to accumulate and condense into toxic bisretinoid compounds,
    most notably A2E (N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine) and atRAL dimer-PE.
    These bisretinoids accumulate progressively in the retinal pigment epithelium
    following phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments.

- name: RPE cell dysfunction and death
  description: >
    Accumulated bisretinoids (A2E and related compounds) are cytotoxic to RPE cells.
    A2E disrupts lysosomal function, inhibits the visual cycle enzyme RPE65, generates
    reactive oxygen species upon light exposure, and activates complement pathways.
    Progressive RPE cell death leads to geographic atrophy of the macula, beginning
    at the fovea and expanding centrifugally, with characteristic yellow-white pisciform
    flecks at the junction of affected and unaffected RPE.

  evidence: []
- name: Secondary photoreceptor degeneration
  description: >
    The intimate metabolic relationship between RPE and photoreceptors means that
    RPE dysfunction and death inevitably leads to secondary degeneration of overlying
    cone and rod photoreceptors. In Stargardt disease, cone photoreceptors of the
    fovea are preferentially affected, accounting for loss of high-acuity central
    vision, color discrimination, and reading ability. Peripheral rod photoreceptors
    may be relatively spared until later disease stages.

  description: >
    Bilateral central vision loss is the cardinal symptom of Stargardt disease,
    typically presenting in the first or second decade of life. Visual acuity
    often declines to 20/200 or worse over years to decades, sparing peripheral
    vision. The rate of progression is variable.

  description: >
    Geographic atrophy of the macular RPE and overlying photoreceptors, typically
    beginning at or near the fovea. The atrophic zone has a beaten-bronze or
    bull's-eye appearance and expands centrifugally over time. Fundus autofluorescence
    reveals hypo-autofluorescent patches corresponding to RPE atrophy, surrounded
    by a halo of hyper-autofluorescence.

    Over 1,000 pathogenic variants have been described in ABCA4, including
    missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations. The most
    common pathogenic variant in Europeans is p.Gly1961Glu (G1961E). Disease
    severity correlates loosely with residual ABCA4 function: null/null genotypes
    cause early-onset severe disease, while mild/mild genotypes cause late-onset
    or mild phenotypes. ABCA4 mutations also underlie a spectrum of related
    retinal dystrophies including cone-rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa.

    Stargardt disease type 3 (STGD3) is caused by autosomal dominant mutations
    in ELOVL4, encoding an elongase involved in synthesis of very long chain

    segment membranes and RPE.
