has_subtypes:
- name: Stargardt Disease Type 1 (STGD1)
  description: >
    Most common form, caused by biallelic mutations in the ABCA4 gene. Autosomal recessive
    inheritance. Accounts for approximately 95% of cases.
- name: Stargardt Disease Type 3 (STGD3)
  description: >
    Rare autosomal dominant form caused by mutations in the ELOVL4 gene. Typically presents
    with macular dystrophy and may have later onset than STGD1.
- name: Stargardt Disease Type 4 (STGD4)
  description: >
    Rare autosomal dominant form caused by mutations in the PROM1 gene. Characterized
    by macular dystrophy with variable phenotype.
pathophysiology:
- name: ABCA4 Transporter Dysfunction
  description: >
    Loss-of-function mutations in the ABCA4 gene impair the ATP-binding cassette
    transporter responsible for flipping N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine
    (N-Ret-PE) and phosphatidylethanolamine across photoreceptor disc membranes.
    This leads to accumulation of toxic retinoid byproducts in photoreceptor
    outer segments.

- name: Lipofuscin and A2E Accumulation in RPE
  description: >
    Failure to clear all-trans-retinal from photoreceptor discs results in formation
    of A2E (N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine), a bisretinoid fluorophore that
    accumulates as lipofuscin in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. A2E is
    phototoxic and triggers RPE cell death through oxidative stress and lysosomal
    dysfunction.

    explanation: iPSC-derived RPE from STGD1 patients demonstrates intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent material (lipofuscin) and PE, directly linking ABCA4 dysfunction to RPE lipofuscin accumulation.
- name: RPE Endo-Lysosomal Dysfunction
  description: >
    ABCA4 dysfunction leads to elevated lysosomal pH in RPE cells, impairing
    cathepsin D (CatD) maturation and activity. CatD is the primary RPE lysosomal
    protease required for photoreceptor outer segment degradation. Impaired CatD
    results in reduced outer segment degradation and accumulation of substrates
    including alpha-synuclein, further exacerbating endo-lysosomal dysfunction.

- name: Photoreceptor Degeneration
  description: >
    Progressive death of photoreceptors, particularly cones in the macula,
    secondary to RPE dysfunction and direct toxic effects of accumulated
    bisretinoids. Loss of photoreceptors leads to progressive central vision
    loss and eventual macular atrophy.
