description: >
  Stargardt disease (STGD1) is the most common inherited macular dystrophy, typically
  presenting in childhood or adolescence with progressive bilateral central vision loss.
  It is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the ABCA4 gene, which encodes
  a retina-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter essential for clearing
  N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-retinylidene-PE) from photoreceptor disc
  membranes. ABCA4 dysfunction leads to accumulation of toxic bisretinoid lipofuscin
  compounds, particularly A2E, in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, causing RPE
  cell death followed by secondary photoreceptor degeneration. Clinical hallmarks include
  macular atrophy, characteristic yellow-white fundus flecks, and a dark choroid on
  fluorescein angiography.

    description: >
      The classic STGD1 form follows autosomal recessive inheritance with biallelic
      ABCA4 mutations. Over 1000 disease-causing variants have been identified in
      ABCA4. Compound heterozygosity is common, with genotype-phenotype correlations
      influencing age of onset and severity.
pathophysiology:
  - name: ABCA4 transporter dysfunction and bisretinoid accumulation
    description: >
      ABCA4 is a flippase that transports N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine
      (N-retinylidene-PE) from the luminal to the cytoplasmic leaflet of photoreceptor
      outer segment disc membranes. Loss of ABCA4 function causes N-retinylidene-PE
      to react with a second molecule of all-trans-retinal, forming the toxic bisretinoid
      A2E (N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine) and other lipofuscin fluorophores.
      These bisretinoids accumulate in RPE cells following phagocytosis of shed
      photoreceptor outer segments.

    description: >
      Accumulated bisretinoids including A2E are cytotoxic to RPE cells through multiple
      mechanisms: generation of reactive oxygen species, disruption of lysosomal function,
      complement activation, and induction of apoptosis. RPE cell death leads to loss of
      metabolic support for overlying photoreceptors, resulting in secondary photoreceptor
      degeneration and progressive macular atrophy. The pattern typically begins centrally
      and expands outward.

notes: >
  Stargardt disease was first described by Karl Stargardt in 1909. It is the most common
  inherited macular dystrophy with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 8,000-10,000. The
  ABCA4 gene is also implicated in other retinal dystrophies including cone-rod dystrophy,
  retinitis pigmentosa, and age-related macular degeneration (as a susceptibility factor).
  The dark choroid sign on fluorescein angiography, while not pathognomonic, is highly
  characteristic and results from lipofuscin absorption of excitation light. Optical
  coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging are key monitoring
  tools. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically for Stargardt disease,
  but multiple therapeutic approaches are in clinical development.
