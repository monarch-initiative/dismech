- name: Stargardt Disease Type 1 (STGD1)
  description: >
    Most common form, caused by biallelic mutations in the ABCA4 gene. Autosomal recessive
    inheritance. Accounts for approximately 95% of cases.
- name: Stargardt Disease Type 3 (STGD3)
  description: >
    Rare autosomal dominant form caused by mutations in the ELOVL4 gene. Typically presents
    with macular dystrophy and may have later onset than STGD1.
- name: Stargardt Disease Type 4 (STGD4)
  description: >
    Rare autosomal dominant form caused by mutations in the PROM1 gene. Characterized
    by macular dystrophy with variable phenotype.
pathophysiology:
- name: ABCA4 Transporter Dysfunction
  description: >
    Loss-of-function mutations in the ABCA4 gene impair the ATP-binding cassette
    transporter responsible for flipping N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine
    (N-Ret-PE) and phosphatidylethanolamine across photoreceptor disc membranes.
    This leads to accumulation of toxic retinoid byproducts in photoreceptor
    outer segments.

    protease required for photoreceptor outer segment degradation. Impaired CatD
    results in reduced outer segment degradation and accumulation of substrates
    including alpha-synuclein, further exacerbating endo-lysosomal dysfunction.

    snippet: "Drug-mediated re-acidification of lysosomes in the RPE of STGD1 restores CatD functional activity and reduces the accumulation of immature CatD protein loads."
    explanation: Preclinical evidence from iPSC-RPE models showing that lysosomal re-acidification restores cathepsin D activity, validating this as a therapeutic approach.
