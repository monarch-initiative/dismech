description: 'Isovaleric acidemia (IVA; OMIM 243500) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of leucine catabolism caused by
  deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD). IVD catalyzes the conversion of isovaleryl-CoA
  to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA; its deficiency leads to accumulation of isovaleric acid, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, isovalerylcarnitine
  (C5), and isovalerylglycine in body fluids. The clinical spectrum ranges from severe neonatal-onset metabolic crises with
  ketoacidosis, hyperammonemia, and encephalopathy to attenuated biochemical-only phenotypes detected by newborn screening.
  Treatment consists of leucine-restricted diet, carnitine and glycine supplementation, and emergency management during catabolic
  episodes. Secondary hyperammonemia results from inhibition of N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) by isovaleryl-CoA.

    metabolite excreted in urine. However, glycine supplementation should be carefully considered as increased glycine concentration

  description: 'N-carbamylglutamate is a synthetic analog of N-acetylglutamate approved for treatment of hyperammonemia in
    IVA. It directly activates CPS1, bypassing the NAGS inhibition caused by isovaleryl-CoA, and can rapidly normalize ammonia

    snippet: Isovaleric acidemia (IVA, OMIM 243500) is an inherited disorder of leucine metabolism caused by a deficiency
      of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD)
    explanation: Inherited genetic etiology supports the role of genetic counseling for affected families.
notes: 'The clinical spectrum of IVA has broadened with the introduction of newborn screening, which detects many individuals
  with attenuated biochemical phenotypes (mild IVA) who may never develop clinical symptoms. This has raised questions about
  potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment. A major practical challenge in NBS is the false-positive rate from pivaloylcarnitine,
  which is isobaric with isovalerylcarnitine. Second-tier chromatographic methods and machine learning approaches are being
  implemented to improve screening specificity. Glycine conjugation via GLYAT and GLYATL1 represents a key detoxification
  pathway, though 2023 evidence suggests the enzyme kinetics limit the benefit of simply increasing glycine supplementation.
