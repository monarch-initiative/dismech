  - name: Bony Dehiscence of Semicircular Canal
    description: >-
      An abnormal opening or thinning in the bone overlying the superior semicircular canal
      creates a pathological third mobile window in the inner ear, in addition to the oval
      and round windows. This dehiscence may result from congenitally thin otic capsule
      bone predisposition with subsequent trauma trigger.

          Histopathologic examination of the right ear showed a 1.4 x 0.6-mm dehiscence
          of bone covering the superior canal. Dura was in direct contact with the endosteum
          and the membranous duct at the level of the dehiscence.
        explanation: >-
          Histopathological examination confirmed the anatomical basis of the dehiscence
          with direct dura-to-membranous duct contact at the bony defect.
  - name: Third Window Effect
    description: >-
      The dehiscence acts as a third mobile window that shunts acoustic energy away from
      the cochlea and toward the vestibular system. A third window introduces a low
      mechanical impedance, shunting part of the inner ear fluid pressure and fluid
      volume flow at the site of the window.

          If sufficiently large, a third window will introduce a low mechanical impedance,
          thus shunting part of the inner ear fluid pressure and fluid volume flow at the
          site of the window.
        explanation: >-
          This biomechanical review explains how the dehiscence creates abnormal fluid
          dynamics by introducing a low-impedance pathway.

        snippet: >-
          A number of disparate disorders affecting the labyrinth can produce CHL by
          acting as a pathologic third window in the inner ear. The common denominator
          is that these conditions result in a mobile window on the scala vestibuli side
          of the cochlear partition.
        explanation: >-
          This landmark paper establishes the third window mechanism as the cause of
          the conductive hearing loss pattern seen in SCDS.
  - name: Abnormal Sound and Pressure Transmission
    description: >-
      Sounds and pressure changes that normally would not affect the vestibular system
      can now stimulate the superior semicircular canal, leading to vestibular symptoms
      triggered by loud sounds (Tullio phenomenon) or pressure changes (Hennebert sign).
      Sound energy diverted toward the dehiscence generates pressure differences across
      the membranous vestibular labyrinth that excite traveling waves.

notes: >-
  Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome was first described by Lloyd
  Minor and colleagues in 1998. The condition is also known as Minor syndrome.
  A cadaveric survey of 1,000 temporal bones found 0.5% had complete dehiscence
  and another 1.4% had significant thinning of bone overlying the superior canal,
  though clinical presentation of symptoms is less common than anatomic prevalence
  suggests.
