  Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD), also known as Jeune syndrome,
  is an autosomal recessive skeletal ciliopathy characterized by a narrow, bell-shaped
  thorax with short ribs leading to respiratory insufficiency. It is genetically
  heterogeneous, caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the intraflagellar
  transport (IFT) machinery and dynein motor complexes essential for primary cilium
  function. Additional features include short limbs, polydactyly, renal cystic
  disease, hepatic fibrosis, and retinal dystrophy. JATD represents the mildest
  end of the short-rib polydactyly syndrome spectrum.

pathophysiology:
- name: Intraflagellar Transport Dysfunction
  description: >
    Mutations in IFT genes (IFT80, IFT140, IFT172, WDR19, and others) disrupt
    the bidirectional transport system within primary cilia. This impairs ciliary
    assembly, maintenance, and signaling, particularly Hedgehog pathway transduction
    required for skeletal development.
