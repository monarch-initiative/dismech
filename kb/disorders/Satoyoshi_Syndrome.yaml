description: >-
  A rare multisystem disorder characterized by progressive painful muscle spasms,
  alopecia (often progressing to alopecia universalis), chronic diarrhea with
  malabsorption, and skeletal abnormalities. Amenorrhea is common in affected
  females. An autoimmune basis is presumed based on the frequent presence of
  autoantibodies, inflammatory tissue infiltrates, and response to immunosuppressive
  therapy. Approximately 73% of reported cases are female, with median onset
  around age 11 and median age at diagnosis of 16 years. Most cases have been
  reported from Japan.
prevalence:
- population: Global
  percentage: Rare
  notes: >-
    Approximately 64-77 cases have been reported worldwide in the published
    literature as of 2022, indicating extreme rarity.
