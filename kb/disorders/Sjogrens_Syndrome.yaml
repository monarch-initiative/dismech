    label: Sjogren syndrome
description: >-
  A chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and
  destruction of exocrine glands, primarily the salivary and lacrimal glands,
  leading to sicca symptoms (dry eyes and dry mouth). Can occur as primary
  disease or secondary to other autoimmune conditions.
pathophysiology:
- name: Exocrine Gland Lymphocytic Infiltration
  description: >-
    CD4+ T cells and B cells infiltrate salivary and lacrimal glands, forming
    ectopic germinal center-like structures. This lymphocytic infiltration
    leads to progressive glandular destruction and dysfunction.

    snippet: "The ductal cells of the salivary gland in pSS are characteristically
      surrounded by a CD4+ T cell-rich and B cell-rich infiltrate, implying a degree
      of communication between epithelial cells and immune cells."
    explanation: Demonstrates the characteristic lymphocytic infiltration
      pattern in salivary glands with both CD4+ T cells and B cells surrounding
      ductal epithelium.
- name: Autoantibody Production
  description: >-
    Characteristic autoantibodies include anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB, which
    target ribonucleoprotein complexes. These antibodies serve as diagnostic
    markers and may contribute to tissue damage through immune complex formation.

    snippet: "Primary Sjögren's disease is primarily driven by B-cell activation and
      is associated with a high risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)."
    explanation: Highlights the central role of B-cell activation in primary
      Sjögren's disease, which drives autoantibody production including
      anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies.
- name: Type I Interferon Signature
  description: >-
    Elevated type I interferon activity drives disease pathogenesis through
    activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and upregulation of
    interferon-stimulated genes in affected tissues.

  - preferred_term: Type I Interferon Response

    snippet: "Multiple innate immune pathways are likely dysregulated in the salivary
      gland epithelium in pSS, including the nuclear factor-κB pathway, the inflammasome
      and interferon signalling."
    explanation: Confirms that interferon signaling is a key dysregulated
      pathway in the salivary gland epithelium, contributing to the type I
      interferon signature observed in Sjögren's syndrome.
  - reference: PMID:38982205
    supports: PARTIAL
    snippet: "Several randomized controlled trials have just been completed or are
      poised to commence evaluating the effectiveness of novel drugs targeting both
      innate and adaptive immune pathways, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, the
      type I interferon system, B cell activation, B cell and T cell co-stimulation
      pathway, and ectopic germinal centre formation."
    explanation: Highlights type I interferon system as a major therapeutic
      target in Sjögren's syndrome, underscoring its central pathogenic role.
- name: Epithelial Cell Dysfunction
  description: >-
    Salivary and lacrimal gland epithelial cells exhibit intrinsic abnormalities
    including aberrant apoptosis, antigen presentation via MHC class II, and
    production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including BAFF.

    snippet: "B cell infiltrates within the ducts can initiate the development of
      lymphoepithelial lesions, including basal ductal cell hyperplasia. Vice versa,
      the epithelium provides chronic activation signals to the glandular B cell fraction."
    explanation: Demonstrates that epithelial cells actively participate in
      disease pathogenesis by providing chronic activation signals to immune
      cells, not merely serving as passive targets.
