name: Achondrogenesis Type II
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Achondrogenesis type II (ACG2), also known as Langer-Saldino type, is the most severe
  form of type 2 collagenopathy caused by dominant mutations in COL2A1. It is a lethal
  skeletal dysplasia characterized by severe micromelia, deficient ossification of the
  vertebral bodies and sacrum, short ribs with fractures, and a disproportionately large
  head. Death typically occurs in utero or shortly after birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia.
  ACG2 represents the severe end of the COL2A1 mutation spectrum, which includes
  hypochondrogenesis, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, and Stickler syndrome.

    description: >
      Almost all cases arise from de novo heterozygous mutations in COL2A1, as affected
      individuals do not survive to reproduce. Germline mosaicism can lead to recurrence
      in siblings.

        snippet: "This mutation was not found in the parents. Although, we could not evaluate the presence of this mutation in the first fetus, we strongly believe that our data are in favor of germline mosaicism as the most likely explanation for the recurrence of type II achondrogenesis in both sibs."
        explanation: Demonstrates that germline mosaicism can cause recurrence of ACG2 within families despite apparent de novo mutations.
pathophysiology:
  - name: Type II Collagen Structural Defect
    description: >
      Mutations in COL2A1 disrupt the triple helix structure of type II collagen, the
      major structural protein of cartilage. Glycine substitutions in the Gly-X-Y repeat
      domain prevent proper helix formation, leading to intracellular retention and
      degradation of abnormal procollagen chains.
