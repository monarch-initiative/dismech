name: Aflatoxin-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma
description: >-
  Aflatoxin-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a form of liver cancer strongly
  associated with dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a mycotoxin produced by
  Aspergillus fungi that contaminate stored grains and nuts in tropical regions.
  Aflatoxin exposure synergizes dramatically with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
  infection, increasing HCC risk approximately 60-fold compared to either factor alone.
  The molecular signature of aflatoxin-related HCC is the TP53 R249S mutation, resulting
  from AFB1-DNA adduct formation at codon 249. This disease exemplifies gene-environment
  interaction in cancer etiology and is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and
  Southeast Asia where both aflatoxin exposure and HBV infection are endemic.

  description: >-
    Chronic HBV infection is a major cofactor in aflatoxin-related HCC, with
    synergistic interaction dramatically increasing cancer risk. HBV contributes
    through chronic inflammation, hepatocyte regeneration, HBx protein effects,
    and viral DNA integration. The combination of HBV and aflatoxin exposure
    increases HCC risk approximately 60-fold compared to unexposed individuals.

  description: >-
    Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus fungi
    that contaminate corn, peanuts, and other crops during storage in warm, humid
    conditions. After ingestion, AFB1 is metabolized in the liver to a highly
    reactive epoxide that forms DNA adducts, preferentially at the third position
    of codon 249 in TP53, causing the characteristic G>T transversion (R249S mutation).

    snippet: Exposure to aflatoxins, potent mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fungi contaminating staple foods, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are major etiological factors, especially where they co-exist.
    explanation: This abstract identifies aflatoxin exposure as a major etiological factor for HCC, supporting the environmental risk described.
pathophysiology:
- name: Aflatoxin B1 Metabolic Activation
  description: >-
    AFB1 is absorbed from the gut and transported to the liver where it undergoes
    cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation (primarily CYP3A4 and CYP1A2) to form
    AFB1-8,9-epoxide, a highly reactive electrophile. This epoxide binds covalently
    to DNA, forming pro-mutagenic adducts primarily at guanine residues.

    description: DNA adducts at codon 249 cause characteristic G>T transversion
- name: TP53 R249S Hotspot Mutation
  description: >-
    The aflatoxin-DNA adduct forms preferentially at the third position of codon 249
    in TP53, causing a G>T transversion that results in arginine-to-serine substitution
    (R249S). This mutation is found in approximately 50% of HCCs in high-aflatoxin
    regions but is rare in low-exposure areas. The R249S mutation impairs p53 DNA
    binding and transcriptional activity, eliminating its tumor suppressor function.

  description: >-
    HBV and aflatoxin interact synergistically through multiple mechanisms:
    HBV-induced chronic inflammation increases hepatocyte proliferation, allowing
    fixation of aflatoxin-induced mutations; HBx protein inhibits DNA repair;
    and viral integration may disrupt tumor suppressor genes. The multiplicative
    interaction results in approximately 60-fold increased HCC risk compared to
    unexposed individuals.
