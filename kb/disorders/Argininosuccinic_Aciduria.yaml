description: 'Argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA) is an autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder caused by deficiency of argininosuccinate
  lyase (ASL), the enzyme that cleaves argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. ASL deficiency creates a block in ureagenesis,
  predisposing to hyperammonemia, and simultaneously disrupts arginine availability for nitric oxide (NO) production via the
  citrulline-NO cycle. The disease produces multisystem pathology in which neurological and hepatic phenotypes may be partly
  ammonia-independent, driven by cell-autonomous NO deficiency, oxidative stress with glutathione depletion, and impaired
  hepatic glycogen metabolism. Chronic complications include neurocognitive deficits, epilepsy, late-onset movement disorders,
  chronic liver disease with fibrosis, and systemic hypertension.

- name: Impaired ureagenesis and hyperammonemia
  description: 'ASL deficiency reduces conversion of argininosuccinate to arginine and fumarate, blocking the urea cycle and
    impairing disposal of ammonia-derived nitrogen. This leads to hyperammonemia, classically presenting as neonatal or early-life
    metabolic decompensation with acute encephalopathy risk. However, ammonia control alone does not fully prevent chronic
    complications, indicating additional tissue-autonomous mechanisms.

    has been questioned.

    snippet: Interrogations have raised about the benefit of newborn screening or liver transplantation on the neurological
      phenotype.
    explanation: Supports newborn screening availability while noting uncertainty about neurological benefit.
- name: mRNA therapy (investigational)
  description: 'Lipid nanoparticle-delivered human ASL mRNA is an emerging investigational therapy that has shown preclinical
    efficacy in correcting both glutathione metabolism and ureagenesis in ASL-deficient mouse models, with rescue of chronic
    liver disease. This approach supports clinical translation for ASA.

    snippet: These findings provide mechanistic insights in liver glutathione metabolism and support clinical translation
      of mRNA therapy for argininosuccinic aciduria.
    explanation: Demonstrates preclinical efficacy of mRNA therapy for ASA.
