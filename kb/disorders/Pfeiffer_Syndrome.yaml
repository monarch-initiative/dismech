name: Pfeiffer Syndrome
category: Mendelian
description: >
  Pfeiffer syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome caused by mutations in FGFR1 or FGFR2,
  characterized by craniosynostosis, broad thumbs and great toes, and variable syndactyly.
  Three clinical subtypes exist: Type 1 (classic) is the mildest with normal intelligence
  and good prognosis; Types 2 and 3 are severe forms with cloverleaf skull deformity
  (Type 2) or without (Type 3), associated with significant neurological complications.
  FGFR2 mutations cause all three types; FGFR1 mutations cause only Type 1.

parents:
  - FGFR-related craniosynostosis

inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal Dominant
    description: >
      Autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance. Type 1 may be inherited;
      Types 2 and 3 almost always arise de novo due to their severe phenotype.
pathophysiology:
  - name: FGFR Gain-of-Function Signaling
    description: >
      Mutations in FGFR1 (P252R) or FGFR2 cause constitutive receptor activation,
      leading to premature cranial suture fusion and abnormal limb development.
      FGFR2 mutations causing Types 2 and 3 often affect the tyrosine kinase domain
      or cause more severe receptor dysregulation than Type 1 mutations.

        snippet: "A C to G transversion in exon 5, predicting a proline to arginine substitution in the putative extracellular domain, was identified in all affected members of five unrelated PS families but not in any unaffected individuals."
        explanation: Demonstrates that the FGFR1 P252R mutation causes familial Pfeiffer syndrome through a gain-of-function mechanism in the extracellular domain.
genetic:
  - name: FGFR1 and FGFR2 Mutations
    association: Causative
    notes: >
      FGFR1 P252R mutation causes only mild Type 1 Pfeiffer syndrome. FGFR2
      mutations are more common and can cause all three types. Severe mutations
      (W290C, Y340C, C342R) in FGFR2 are associated with Types 2 and 3.
