description: >
  Jackson-Weiss syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome caused by heterozygous
  mutations in FGFR2, characterized by craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and
  foot abnormalities including broad great toes and tarsal/metatarsal fusion. Unlike
  Apert and Pfeiffer syndromes, hand involvement is typically absent or minimal.
  The syndrome was originally described in a large Amish kindred and shows significant
  intrafamilial variability.

    snippet: "The inter- and intrafamilial variability in expression of FGFR2 mutations suggests that these three syndromes, presumed to be clinically distinct, are instead representative of a spectrum of related craniosynostotic and digital disorders."
    explanation: "Confirms variable expressivity both within and between families with FGFR2 mutations."
pathophysiology:
- name: FGFR2 Gain-of-Function Signaling
  description: >
    Mutations in FGFR2 cause constitutive receptor activation, leading to
    premature cranial suture fusion and abnormal skeletal development in
    the feet. The specific mutations overlap with those causing Crouzon
    and Pfeiffer syndromes, with phenotype depending on genetic background
    and other modifying factors.

  notes: >
    Various FGFR2 mutations have been identified, including some shared with
    Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes (e.g., C342R, A344G). The phenotypic
    outcome depends on genetic background and potentially other modifying
    factors.
