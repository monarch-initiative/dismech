description: >-
  BRAF V600E-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a molecularly-defined lung
  cancer subtype driven by the BRAF V600E activating mutation. BRAF V600E occurs in
  approximately 1-2% of NSCLC and represents about half of all BRAF mutations in lung
  cancer. The V600E mutation causes constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway
  independent of upstream RAS signaling. The combination of dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor)
  plus trametinib (MEK inhibitor) provides effective targeted therapy, analogous to
  treatment of BRAF V600E melanoma.

has_subtypes:
- name: BRAF V600E Adenocarcinoma
  description: >-
    The majority of BRAF V600E NSCLC presents as adenocarcinoma histology.
    V600E is a class I BRAF mutation causing RAS-independent RAF dimerization.
- name: BRAF Non-V600 Mutant NSCLC
  description: >-
    Non-V600 BRAF mutations (class II and III) account for approximately 50%
    of BRAF mutations in NSCLC. These have different mechanisms and do not
    respond to BRAF V600E-specific inhibitors.
pathophysiology:
- name: BRAF V600E Oncogenic Mutation
  description: >-
    The BRAF V600E mutation substitutes glutamic acid for valine at codon 600
    in the activation segment. This mimics phosphorylation, causing constitutive
    kinase activation. V600E signals as a monomer independent of upstream RAS,
    unlike wild-type BRAF which requires RAS-mediated dimerization.

    snippet: "The incidence of BRAF mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients ranges from 1.5% to 5.5%, with BRAF V600 mutations accounting for approximately 30%-50% of all BRAF mutations, among which BRAF V600E represents the most prevalent mutation type."
    explanation: "Supports the presence and predominance of BRAF V600E among BRAF-mutant NSCLC."

    description: RAS-independent ERK signaling
- name: Constitutive MAPK Pathway Activation
  description: >-
    BRAF V600E constitutively phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2, which in turn
    phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. This leads to uncontrolled proliferation
    and survival signaling. The lack of dependence on upstream RAS makes the
    tumor exquisitely sensitive to BRAF inhibition.

    description: ERK-driven transcription of pro-growth genes

  description: >-
    Constitutive ERK signaling drives expression of cyclin D1 and other cell
    cycle genes, promoting uncontrolled proliferation. ERK also inhibits
    pro-apoptotic proteins through phosphorylation.

- name: BRAF/MEK Inhibitor Resistance
  description: >-
    Resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibition can develop through MAPK pathway reactivation
    (BRAF amplification, MEK mutations, NRAS mutations), bypass pathway activation
    (PI3K-AKT), or histologic transformation. Combination BRAF+MEK inhibition delays
    resistance compared to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy.

- name: BRAF Mutation Testing
  notes: >-
    BRAF testing is part of standard molecular profiling for advanced NSCLC.
    Testing should distinguish V600E from non-V600 mutations as treatment
    implications differ. V600E accounts for ~50% of BRAF mutations in NSCLC.
    Non-V600 mutations (class II: K601E, G469A; class III: G466V, D594G) are
    not responsive to V600E-targeted therapies.
