  Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare, non-hereditary gastrointestinal polyposis syndrome characterized by the
  association of extensive hamartomatous polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract with a distinctive cutaneous triad
  of alopecia, nail changes (onychodystrophy), and hyperpigmentation. The condition has significant gastrointestinal
  morbidity including protein-losing enteropathy, chronic diarrhea, and increased cancer risk. Although historically considered
  a relentlessly progressive disease with high mortality, modern advances in understanding and treatment with corticosteroids and
  immunomodulators have substantially improved prognosis and overall survival.

pathophysiology:
- name: Hamartomatous polyp formation in the gastrointestinal tract
  description: >
    Cronkhite-Canada syndrome is characterized by widespread hamartomatous polyps involving the entire gastrointestinal
    tract, most commonly the stomach, small intestine, and colon. The polyps are composed of abundant lamina propria
    inflammatory infiltrate with cystic glands. Pathological examination shows gland/crypt changes including cystic
    dilatation filled with protein fluid or mucus, gland withering and branching, and lamina propria edema.

notes: >
  Cronkhite-Canada syndrome is a rare disorder with unknown etiology. Most patients respond to corticosteroid therapy,
  but long-term management and monitoring for malignancy is essential. The condition carries increased risk of gastrointestinal
  malignancies including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer, making regular endoscopic surveillance critical.
  The condition requires multidisciplinary care including gastroenterology, dermatology, and nutritional support. Serious metabolic
  complications including electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia from protein-losing enteropathy) can predispose to
  cardiac arrhythmias, requiring careful electrolyte monitoring and cardiac surveillance. Extended duration of maintenance corticosteroid
  therapy is often necessary to prevent relapse. Early recognition and prompt immunosuppressive therapy are critical for preventing
  complications and improving patient outcomes.
