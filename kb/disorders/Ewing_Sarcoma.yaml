description: >-
  Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric bone and soft tissue malignancy
  characterized by the pathognomonic EWS-FLI1 fusion gene, present in approximately
  85% of cases. This translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) creates a chimeric transcription
  factor that aberrantly activates genes driving proliferation and blocks
  differentiation. The EWS-FLI1 fusion is both diagnostic and represents a compelling
  but challenging therapeutic target. Ewing sarcoma exemplifies the concept of
  fusion oncogene-driven cancer with a single genetic driver.

has_subtypes:
- name: Osseous Ewing Sarcoma
  description: >-
    Primary tumors arising in bone, most commonly the pelvis, femur, and other
    long bones. Accounts for approximately 80% of Ewing sarcoma cases. Typically
    presents with localized pain and swelling.
- name: Extraosseous Ewing Sarcoma
  description: >-
    Primary tumors arising in soft tissues outside of bone. Can occur in chest
    wall, paravertebral region, or extremities. Shares the same EWS-FLI1 fusion
    and treated similarly to osseous disease.
pathophysiology:
- name: EWS-FLI1 Fusion Oncogene
  description: >-
    The t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation fuses the EWS gene (EWSR1) on chromosome 22
    with the FLI1 gene on chromosome 11. The resulting EWS-FLI1 protein functions
    as an aberrant transcription factor that activates proliferative genes and
    represses differentiation programs. This single genetic event is the primary
    driver of Ewing sarcoma.

    snippet: "Ewing sarcomas are driven by EWS-ETS fusions, most commonly EWS-FLI1, which promotes widespread metabolic reprogramming, including activation of serine biosynthesis."
    explanation: This study demonstrates that EWS-FLI1 is the driver fusion oncogene in Ewing sarcoma that activates transcriptional programs including metabolic reprogramming.
- name: Aberrant Transcriptional Regulation
  description: >-
    EWS-FLI1 binds to GGAA microsatellite repeats throughout the genome, creating
    de novo enhancers that activate oncogenic target genes including NKX2-2, NR0B1,
    and IGF1. This abnormal enhancer activity reprograms cell identity and drives
    the Ewing sarcoma phenotype.

    explanation: This study demonstrates that EWS-FLI1 functions as an aberrant transcription factor that directly binds promoter regions to activate target genes.
- name: Blocked Differentiation
  description: >-
    EWS-FLI1 represses genes required for mesenchymal differentiation, maintaining
    cells in a proliferative, undifferentiated state. The cell of origin remains
    debated but may be a neural crest-derived mesenchymal progenitor.

    The t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation creates the EWS-FLI1 fusion in 85%
    of cases. EWS-ERG t(21;22) accounts for most remaining cases. All Ewing
    sarcomas harbor EWS-ETS family fusions, which are both diagnostic and
    represent the primary oncogenic driver.
