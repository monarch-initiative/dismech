name: com_Atopic_Dermatitis__Type_2_Diabetes_Mellitus
curation_status: CANDIDATE
notes: >-
  Non-obvious comorbidity with mixed epidemiologic evidence. Recent cohort and
  Mendelian randomization studies suggest AD increases T2D risk, while systematic
  review results are sensitive to T2D definition.

hypotheses:
  - description: >-
      Hypothesis: chronic inflammatory activity in AD may increase systemic
      metabolic risk and contribute to insulin resistance and T2D.

        snippet: "Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic relapsing inflammatory dermatosis characterized by pruritus, xerosis, and a close association with IgE mediated sensitization to aeroallergens and foods."
        explanation: AD is described as a chronic inflammatory dermatosis, supporting an inflammation-based hypothesis.
    pathophysiology:
      - name: Systemic inflammatory burden
        description: >-
          Chronic inflammatory signaling in AD could promote metabolic stress and
          insulin resistance that increase T2D risk.

            explanation: AD is explicitly described as inflammatory, motivating systemic inflammation as a shared mechanism.

            snippet: "In acute lesions of AD, the T-helper type 2 cells produce interleukin (IL) 4, IL-13, and IL-31, which may potentiate barrier dysfunction and contribute to pruritus."
            explanation: AD lesions show Th2 cytokine production, supporting a type 2 immune response mechanism.
