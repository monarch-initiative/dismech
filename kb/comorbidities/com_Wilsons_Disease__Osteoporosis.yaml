notes: >-
  Candidate literature-backed comorbidity linking Wilson disease to reduced bone
  health and osteoporosis. Most available evidence is prevalence-focused
  (cross-sectional or pooled prevalence), so temporal directionality remains
  incompletely established despite biologic plausibility of Wilson disease
  preceding bone loss.

hypotheses:
- description: >-
    Hypothesis: copper-related multisystem toxicity in Wilson disease affects
    both bone and renal tissues, creating a bone fragility milieu.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:38731973
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: OTHER
    snippet: "This explains why copper injures not only the liver, but also the brain, kidneys, eyes, heart, muscles, and bones"
    explanation: Review summary supports direct involvement of both kidney and bone tissues in Wilson disease.
  - reference: PMID:38731973
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: OTHER
    snippet: "Among these are depression, psychosis, dysarthria, ataxia, writing problems, dysphagia, renal tubular dysfunction, Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, arthritis, and arthralgia."
    explanation: Renal tubular dysfunction and osteoporosis are co-listed clinical features, supporting a linked mineral-handling hypothesis.
  pathophysiology:
  - name: Copper toxicity with renal-bone interaction
    description: >-
      Copper toxicity in Wilson disease may simultaneously injure renal tubular
      and skeletal compartments, predisposing to mineral dysregulation and bone
      fragility.

    Hypothesis: hepatic synthetic and nutritional status contributes to bone
    health variability in Wilson disease.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:40950651
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "However, serum albumin positively correlated with bone density (P = .018)."
    explanation: Albumin-bone density correlation supports a liver function and nutritional mechanism affecting bone status.
  pathophysiology:
  - name: Albumin-linked bone vulnerability
    description: >-
      Lower albumin in Wilson disease may reflect hepatic dysfunction and/or
      nutritional compromise associated with poorer bone mineralization.
    evidence:
    - reference: PMID:40950651
      supports: SUPPORT
      evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
      snippet: "Bone disease is frequent and often subclinical in pediatric Wilson's disease."
      explanation: Supports frequent, clinically subtle bone involvement in Wilson disease.

      supports: SUPPORT
      evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
      snippet: "However, serum albumin positively correlated with bone density (P = .018)."
      explanation: Correlative evidence links albumin and bone density in pediatric Wilson disease.
- description: >-
    Hypothesis: host factors (age and sex) modify osteoporosis risk expression
    in Wilson disease.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:29110062
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "Meta-regressionshowed significant impacts of age (negative correlation; P=0.002) and male status (positive correlation;P < 0.001) on the prevalence of osteoporosis."
    explanation: Meta-regression indicates age/sex interaction with osteoporosis prevalence, suggesting biologic risk modifiers.
  pathophysiology:
  - name: Age-sex risk modulation
    description: >-
      Osteoporosis risk in Wilson disease appears modified by demographic and
      host factors, implying interaction between copper-related pathology and
      baseline bone-risk biology.
    evidence:
    - reference: PMID:29110062
      supports: SUPPORT
      evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
      snippet: "Meta-regressionshowed significant impacts of age (negative correlation; P=0.002) and male status (positive correlation;P < 0.001) on the prevalence of osteoporosis."
      explanation: Quantifies host-factor dependence of osteoporosis prevalence in Wilson disease cohorts.
- description: >-
    Hypothesis: treatment-course instability (adherence barriers and
    therapy-associated neurologic worsening) may mediate osteoporosis risk in
    Wilson disease through reduced mobility and disease-control disruption.
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:37116715
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "In this study, we identified two peaks in NW: an early (≤3 months) treatment-associated peak and a late (>12 months of treatment) adherence-associated peak."
    explanation: Large multicenter cohort links treatment phase and adherence status to neurological destabilization.
  - reference: PMID:35887738
    supports: SUPPORT
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "As adherence to treatment is a key factor in the successful management of WD, physicians need to be even more vigilant in detecting adherence difficulties in patients receiving treatment with TETA 2HCL."
    explanation: Identifies adherence as a key determinant of Wilson disease control.
  - reference: PMID:40950651
    supports: PARTIAL
    evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
    snippet: "Larger studies are needed to evaluate the effects of treatment and micronutrient status on bone health."
    explanation: Pediatric bone-density study explicitly flags treatment and micronutrient status as potential bone-health determinants requiring deeper study.
  pathophysiology:
  - name: Treatment-course instability and disuse-bone pathway
    description: >-
      In some Wilson disease patients, inadequate decoppering control from
      adherence barriers or treatment-phase neurologic worsening may increase
      functional dependency, reduce skeletal loading, and contribute to bone
      loss and fracture risk.
    evidence:
    - reference: PMID:32398357
      supports: SUPPORT
      evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
      snippet: "All were highly dependent before LT (median mRS score 5)."
      explanation: Refractory neurologic Wilson disease can produce profound dependency consistent with reduced mechanical loading.
    - reference: PMID:32398357
      supports: SUPPORT
      evidence_source: HUMAN_CLINICAL
      snippet: "LT is a rescue therapeutic option that should be carefully discussed in selected patients with neurologic WD resistant to anticopper therapies (chelators or zinc salts) as it might allow patients to gain physical independency with a reasonable risk."
      explanation: Improvement in physical independence after rescue therapy supports a disability-mediated intermediate mechanism.

      explanation: Adult Wilson disease cohorts show clinically meaningful osteoporosis and vertebral fracture burden.
