notes: >-
  Rare but well-documented complication of advanced/metastatic melanoma. DIC
  typically occurs with widely disseminated disease or bone marrow infiltration.
  Multiple mechanistic pathways link melanoma biology to coagulation activation,
  including tissue factor overexpression (amplified by BRAF V600E), cancer
  procoagulant, and procoagulant microvesicle shedding. Only a handful of
  melanoma-DIC cases are reported in the literature as of 2021, but subclinical
  coagulation activation is common in advanced melanoma.

    activation that can progress to DIC in advanced disease. BRAF V600E
    mutation further upregulates TF expression and thrombin generation.

  pathophysiology:

    description: >-
      Melanoma cells constitutively express tissue factor (TF) on their
      surface, in contrast to normal melanocytes. TF initiates the extrinsic
      coagulation cascade, generating thrombin and promoting systemic
      coagulation activation. BRAF V600E mutation amplifies TF expression.
