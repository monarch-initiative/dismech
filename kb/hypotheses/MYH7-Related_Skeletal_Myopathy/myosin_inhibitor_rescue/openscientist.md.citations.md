**Query:** # Mechanistic Hypothesis Search

You are evaluating a specific disease mechanism hypothesis for the Disorder
Mechanisms Knowledge Base. This is not a general disease overview. Use the
hypothesis YAML below as the seed claim, then search for evidence that supports,
refutes, qualifies, or competes with this hypothesis.

## Target Disease
- **Disease Name:** MYH7-Related Skeletal Myopathy
- **Category:** Mendelian

## Target Hypothesis
- **Hypothesis ID:** myosin_inhibitor_rescue
- **Hypothesis Label:** Myosin inhibitors that stabilize the relaxed state can improve skeletal muscle function in MYH7 rod myopathy
- **Status in KB:** EMERGING

## Seed Hypothesis YAML

```yaml
hypothesis_group_id: myosin_inhibitor_rescue
hypothesis_label: Myosin inhibitors that stabilize the relaxed state can improve skeletal muscle function
  in MYH7 rod myopathy
status: EMERGING
description: If the energetic model holds, small molecules that shift heads back toward the relaxed state
  should help. MYK-581 improved running capacity in R1500P mice and normalized the DRX fraction in patient
  myofibrils. Whether the approved cardiac myosin inhibitors mavacamten and aficamten act on slow skeletal
  muscle at tolerable doses, and whether they help myosin storage alleles, is untested.
evidence:
- reference: PMID:38690726
  reference_title: A Laing distal myopathy-associated proline substitution in the β-myosin rod perturbs
    myosin cross-bridging activity.
  supports: SUPPORT
  evidence_source: MODEL_ORGANISM
  snippet: oral administration of MYK-581, a small molecule that decreases the population of heads in
    the DRX configuration, significantly improved the limited running capacity of the R1500P-transgenic
    mice and corrected the increased DRX state of the myofibrils from patients
  explanation: Preclinical rescue motivating the hypothesis.

## Research Objective

Build a focused hypothesis-search report that answers:

1. What is the strongest direct evidence for this hypothesis?
2. What evidence argues against it, fails to reproduce it, or limits its scope?
3. Which claims are established, emerging, speculative, or contradicted?
4. Which patient subtypes, stages, tissues, cell types, molecular pathways, or
   biomarkers does the hypothesis best explain?
5. Which alternative or competing mechanistic hypotheses explain the same disease
   features better or more parsimoniously?
6. What are the explicit knowledge gaps: missing causal steps, unconfirmed edges,
   contradictory evidence, unknown source-to-target links, or source/data absences?
7. What experiments, cohorts, assays, datasets, or trials would most directly
   distinguish this hypothesis from alternatives?

Use primary literature whenever possible. Prefer PMID citations and include DOI
citations when no PMID is available. Treat reviews as orientation unless they
contain directly relevant synthesized evidence that should be clearly labeled as
review-level support.

When dataset or scientific-tool access is available, use it for questions that
can be tested computationally rather than limiting the run to literature search.
Preflight the required data lake, databases, packages, credentials, and tools
before claiming that an analysis can run. Never silently fall back from a failed
dataset/tool analysis to literature synthesis or model knowledge: report the
failure, the fallback, and the resulting limitation explicitly. A proposed
analysis must never be described as performed.

## Required Output

### Executive Judgment

Give a concise verdict on the hypothesis as of the current literature:
supported, partially supported, unresolved, weakly supported, or refuted. Explain
the reasoning and the most important caveats.

### Evidence Matrix

Create a table with one row per important evidence item:

- Citation (PMID preferred)
- Evidence type (human clinical, model organism, in vitro, computational, review)
- Supports / refutes / qualifies / competing
- Mechanistic claim tested
- Key finding
- Disease subtype or context
- Confidence and limitations

### Data and Tool Use

Inventory every dataset, database, API, supplementary file, or local input
material to the report. For each, state:

- stable accession or URI, repository/source, version or snapshot, and retrieval
  date where known;
- whether it was only cited/proposed, actually accessed, searched with no usable
  result, or could not be verified;
- the exact query, filters, cohort, sample subset, organism, tissue, assay, and
  comparison used where applicable;
- whether the accession resolved and whether its subject matter is genuinely
  relevant to this disease and hypothesis.

For accessed sources and negative searches, save a sanitized query response,
input manifest, or search log in the provider artifact bundle; prose alone does
not establish access or a negative result.

Inventory each attempted analysis separately. Trace input -> method -> output,
including software/model versions, material parameters, code or workflow,
environment, random seeds where relevant, output files, and limitations. Label
the execution outcome as succeeded, partial, failed, skipped, or reported-only.
Do not count a prose assertion without inspectable execution evidence as a
successful analysis.

### Mechanistic Causal Chain

Describe the causal chain implied by the hypothesis from upstream trigger to
clinical manifestation. Identify where the literature is strong, where the links
are inferred, and where there are missing causal steps.

### Knowledge Gaps

Identify explicit known unknowns surfaced by the search. Treat absence of
evidence as a curation-relevant finding only when the search actually checked for
it. Include:

- Unknown or weakly supported causal steps in the hypothesis
- Unconfirmed causal graph edges that need direct perturbation or longitudinal
  evidence
- Conflicting evidence, failed replications, or incompatible subtype-specific
  findings
- Unknown mechanism of action for relevant treatments, biomarkers, or
  interventions tied to this hypothesis
- Source-level or dataset-level absences, such as no relevant GenCC, ClinGen,
  trial, omics, or cohort evidence found as of the search date

For each gap, state the scope, why it matters, what was checked, and what
evidence or experiment would resolve it. A negative database search must include
the database/version, query, filters, and search date; otherwise label it
unverified rather than claiming absence.

### Alternative Models

List competing or complementary hypotheses. For each, explain whether it is an
alternative to the seed hypothesis, a downstream consequence, an upstream cause,
or a parallel mechanism.

### Discriminating Tests

Recommend concrete studies or assays that would most efficiently test this
hypothesis against alternatives. Include patient stratification, biomarkers,
sample type, model system, perturbation, and expected result where applicable.

### Curation Leads

Provide candidate updates for the KB, but label these as leads requiring curator
verification. Include:

- candidate evidence references and exact abstract snippets to verify
- candidate pathophysiology nodes or edges
- candidate ontology terms for cell types and biological processes
- candidate subtype restrictions or status changes
- candidate `knowledge_gaps` or discussion prompts for unresolved causal claims,
  conflicting evidence, or explicit source/data absences

If the provider supports artifacts, produce a provider artifact bundle containing
canonical `MANIFEST.yaml` (schema version, status/fallback flags, checksummed
inputs/outputs, and replay verification), code/query/configuration, an
environment or package-version record,
sanitized execution logs, and small derived tables/figures needed to inspect the
result beneath `kb/hypotheses/MYH7-Related_Skeletal_Myopathy/myosin_inhibitor_rescue/openscientist_artifacts`. Do not create an empty bundle when no data
source was accessed and no analysis ran. Give each artifact a stable relative
path and connect computed claims to their input, method, and output artifacts.
Do not bundle large recoverable raw
downloads, a provider data lake, controlled/patient-level data, credentials, or
signed URLs; record their stable external identifiers, versions, and checksums
instead. State explicitly when an expected artifact is external, local-only,
missing, or was not produced.
