explanations:
- explanation_id: NO_EXPLANATION
  estimated_probability: 0.0
  description: No explanation assigned yet for this non-match.
- explanation_id: CASE_TERM_LESS_SPECIFIC
  estimated_probability: 0.99
  description: The case report used a broader HPO term for what is clearly the same
    clinical finding as the model's more specific term. This is a coding granularity
    difference, not a true phenotypic discrepancy. The onset qualifiers in the phenopacket
    confirm the neonatal/congenital nature of these findings.
- explanation_id: CASE_TERM_MORE_SPECIFIC
  estimated_probability: 0.99
  description: The case report encoded a more specific subtype of a finding already
    captured by a broader term in the disease model. The specific finding is fully
    consistent with the model.
- explanation_id: EXCLUDED_NARROWER_DOES_NOT_EXCLUDE_BROADER
  estimated_probability: 0.95
  description: The case excluded a narrower subtype (spastic tetraparesis) but the
    model lists the broader category (spasticity). Exclusion of one specific pattern
    of spasticity does not exclude milder or different forms. P3 died at 7 months,
    before spastic tetraparesis would typically manifest. This is consistent with
    the diagnosis.
- explanation_id: EXPECTED_BIOCHEMICAL_CONSEQUENCE
  estimated_probability: 0.99
  description: The case finding is a direct biochemical consequence of the disease
    mechanism (PDHc deficiency causes pyruvate accumulation and transamination to
    alanine) that is not separately enumerated in the model phenotypes. The model
    captures the same metabolic block via lactic acidosis.
- explanation_id: EXCLUDED_INCIDENTAL_FINDING
  estimated_probability: 0.99
  description: A specific clinical test finding that was noted as excluded in the
    case and is not part of the expected disease phenotype. Its absence is uninformative
    for or against the diagnosis.
- explanation_id: SUBSUMED_BY_DISEASE_DEFINITION
  estimated_probability: 0.99
  description: The finding is the core clinical entity of the disease (encephalopathy
    is in the disease name NELABA) but is modeled via its component manifestations
    (hypotonia, developmental delay, seizures, brain abnormalities) rather than as
    a separate phenotype entry. The absence of a direct model match reflects a modeling
    choice, not a phenotypic discrepancy.
- explanation_id: PHENOTYPIC_VARIABILITY_BRAIN_MALFORMATION
  estimated_probability: 0.9
  description: P3 showed simplified gyral pattern while the model lists polymicrogyria
    (from another patient). Both are cortical malformations reflecting impaired cortical
    development from energy failure, but they represent different morphological patterns
    within the NELABA brain malformation spectrum. With only 4 reported cases, heterogeneity
    in cortical malformation type is expected.
- explanation_id: VARIABLE_EXPRESSIVITY
  estimated_probability: 0.9
  description: The feature is present in the disease model based on observations in
    other reported NELABA patients but was absent or excluded in P3 (or vice versa).
    With only 4 total reported cases, variable expressivity is expected. Features
    like dystonia and polymicrogyria were reported in the 4th case (PMID:39536593),
    while cortical atrophy and delayed myelination were prominent in P1/P2 but not
    P3.
- explanation_id: REDUNDANT_WITH_MODEL_TERM
  estimated_probability: 0.99
  description: The case finding is an overlapping or near-equivalent way to express
    a biochemical abnormality already captured by a different model term. Increased
    circulating lactate concentration is the laboratory measurement underlying the
    clinical diagnosis of lactic acidosis, which is already matched.
- explanation_id: EXPECTED_SECONDARY_FINDING
  estimated_probability: 0.95
  description: Ventriculomegaly is a common secondary neuroimaging finding that accompanies
    the cortical and white matter abnormalities described in NELABA. It is not separately
    listed in the model but is a plausible consequence of the brain pathology.
