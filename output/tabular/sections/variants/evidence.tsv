1128	828	33	Axenfeld-Rieger_syndrome	Axenfeld-Rieger_syndrome.yaml	variants	0	evidence	0	PMID:19218601	NO_EVIDENCE		Two homeobox mutations, R43W and R90C, resulted in severely reduced DNA-binding and transcriptional activation despite normal nuclear localization. L105V, located C-terminal to the homeodomain, resulted in normal localization, reporter gene transactivation, and protein half-life, but with an altered mobility shift pattern of protein-DNA complexes. N108T, also located C-terminal to the homeodomain, resulted in an altered mobility shift pattern and with slightly increased reporter transactivation and shortened protein half-life.	This study does not mention the p.Val136Leu (V45L) variant. It discusses other PITX2 mutations but does not provide evidence for the specific variant mentioned in the statement.

1130	828	33	Axenfeld-Rieger_syndrome	Axenfeld-Rieger_syndrome.yaml	variants	0	evidence	2	PMID:9685346	NO_EVIDENCE		We next studied two Rieger mutants. A threonine to proline mutation (T68P) in the second helix of the homeodomain retained DNA binding activity with the same apparent KD and only about a 2-fold reduction in the Bmax. However, this mutant did not transactivate reporter genes containing the bicoid site.	This study investigates different PITX2 mutations (T68P and L54Q) and does not provide evidence for the p.Val136Leu (V45L) variant.
