# QC Configuration for dismech knowledge base compliance analysis
#
# This file configures weights and minimum thresholds for the compliance analyzer.
# Weights affect the weighted_compliance score (higher weight = more important).
# Thresholds trigger violations if compliance falls below the minimum.
#
# Precedence (highest to lowest):
#   1. Path-specific config (exact match on normalized path + slot)
#   2. Slot-specific config
#   3. Default values

# Default weight for all paths/slots not otherwise configured
default_weight: 1.0

# Default minimum compliance (null = no minimum required)
default_min_compliance: null

# Per-slot configuration (applies to all occurrences of a slot)
slots:
  term:
    weight: 2.0  # Ontology term bindings are important
    min_compliance: 80.0  # Require at least 80% term coverage
  evidence:
    weight: 1.5  # Evidence is valuable but not always required
    min_compliance: null
  description:
    weight: 0.5  # Descriptions are nice-to-have

# Per-path configuration (overrides slot config for specific paths)
# Use jq-style [] notation for list paths
paths:
  # Phenotype terms are critical - most phenotypes should have HPO terms
  "phenotypes[].phenotype_term.term":
    weight: 3.0
    min_compliance: 90.0

  # Cell type terms in pathophysiology are very important
  "pathophysiology[].cell_types[].term":
    weight: 3.0
    min_compliance: 85.0

  # Treatment terms are important for clinical relevance
  "treatments[].treatment_term.term":
    weight: 2.5
    min_compliance: 80.0

  # Disease term at root should always be present
  "disease_term.term":
    weight: 5.0
    min_compliance: 95.0

  # Pathophysiology descriptions are valuable
  "pathophysiology[].description":
    weight: 1.5
    min_compliance: 70.0

  # Pathophysiology evidence is critical
  "pathophysiology[].evidence":
    weight: 2.0
    min_compliance: 80.0
