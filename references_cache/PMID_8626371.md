The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition 
criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia require the presence of characteristic 
symptoms and disabilities, as well as the specific exclusion of other disorders 
with similar symptomatology. Once schizophrenia is diagnosed, the classification 
of schizophrenic symptoms as psychotic, disorganized, or negative can help 
clinicians predict treatment outcomes and individualize both pharmacologic and 
psychosocial treatment. Three treatment phases (acute, resolving, and 
maintenance) have been described; each has different medication strategies and 
goals. The introduction of novel antipsychotic agents, such as clozapine and 
risperidone, has enhanced the clinicians' ability to manage schizophrenic 
patients. Nonetheless, psychosocial treatment remains an important component of 
overall patient management.
