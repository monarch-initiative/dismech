Varicella-zoster virus, a herpesvirus, causes varicella (chickenpox) and, after 
endogenous reactivation, herpes zoster (shingles). Varicella, which is 
recognised by a characteristic vesicular rash, arises mainly in young children, 
although older individuals can be affected. In immunocompetent patients, 
symptoms are usually mild to moderate, but an uncomplicated severe case can have 
more than 1000 lesions and severe constitutional symptoms. Serious 
complications--including central nervous system involvement, pneumonia, 
secondary bacterial infections, and death--are sometimes seen. Varicella can be 
prevented by vaccination. Vaccine is about 80-85% effective against all disease 
and highly (more than 95%) effective in prevention of severe disease. In the 
USA, a routine childhood immunisation programme has reduced disease incidence, 
complications, hospital admissions, and deaths in children and in the general 
population, indicating strong herd immunity. Similar immunisation programmes 
have been adopted by some other countries, including Uruguay, Germany, Taiwan, 
Canada, and Australia, and are expected to be implemented more widely in future.
