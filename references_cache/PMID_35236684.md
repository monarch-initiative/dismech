A laryngeal cleft is a rare anatomical deformity which is increasingly treated 
with injection laryngoplasty. Since diagnosis of laryngeal cleft type I is often 
made between 2 and 5 years of age, this treatment is rarely performed on very 
young children. In this case, we describe how injection laryngoplasty is 
performed safely on an 8-week-old child, and we illustrate its added value for 
the diagnostic process and for temporary symptom relief.
