INTRODUCTION: The thionamide anti-thyroid drugs namely carbimazole, methimazole, 
and propylthiouracil, have been the predominant therapy modality for Graves' 
hyperthyroidism for over 60 years. Although these agents have proven efficacy 
and favorable side-effect profiles, non-thionamide alternatives are occasionally 
indicated in patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to thionamides alone. 
This review examines the available non-thionamide drug options for the control 
of Graves' hyperthyroidism and summarizes their clinical utility, efficacy, and 
limitations.
AREAS COVERED: We reviewed existing literature on mechanisms, therapeutic 
utility, and side-effect profiles of non-thionamide anti-thyroid drugs. 
Established non-thionamide agents act on various phases of the synthesis, 
release, and metabolism of thyroid hormones and comprise historical agents such 
as iodine compounds and potassium perchlorate as well as drug repurposing 
candidates like lithium, glucocorticoids, beta-blockers, and cholestyramine. 
Novel experimental agents in development target key players in Graves' disease 
pathogenesis including B-cell depletors (Rituximab), CD40 blockers (Iscalimab), 
TSH-receptor antagonists, blocking antibodies, and immune-modifying peptides.
EXPERT OPINION: Non-thionamide anti-thyroid drugs are useful alternatives in 
Graves' hyperthyroidism and more clinical trials are needed to establish their 
safety and long-term efficacy in hyperthyroidism control. Ultimately, the 
promise for a cure will lie in novel approaches that target the well-established 
immunopathogenesis of Graves' disease.
