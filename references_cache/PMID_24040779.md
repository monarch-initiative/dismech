Since Ebola virus was discovered in 1970s, the virus has persisted in Africa and 
sporadic fatal outbreaks in humans and non-human primates have been reported. 
However, the evolutionary history of Ebola virus remains unclear. In this study, 
27 Ebola virus strains with complete glycoprotein genes, including five species 
(Zaire, Sudan, Reston, Tai Forest, Bundibugyo), were analysed. Here, we propose 
a hypothesis of the evolutionary history of Ebola virus which will be helpful to 
investigate the molecular evolution of these viruses.
