INTRODUCTION: Equipping medical graduates with the competence to manage 
tuberculosis is not just imperative but also urgent as the diseases have been 
consistently listed as one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in 
Nigeria. However, there were no baseline studies done on knowledge of final year 
medical students on various aspects of TB diagnosis and management under 
directly observed treatment short course therapy (DOTS) which forms the basis of 
this study.
METHODS: A total of 241 final year medical students from three medical colleges 
in Nigeria were interviewed. The questions assessed their knowledge about 
various modes of transmission, symptoms and management of tuberculosis under 
DOTS.
RESULTS: More than half of the respondents (i.e. 69%) had poor knowledge on TB 
disease. Only 33.6% mentioned sputum smear as the best tool of diagnosing TB 
according to guideline. Poor knowledge was also exhibited when asked of various 
categories under DOTS treatment regimen, as 46.1% correctly mentioned cat 1 and 
2. Minority 18.7% and 6.7% had complete knowledge of 6 months duration for new 
TB cases and 8 months for re-treatment cases respectively. Less than one tenth, 
i.e. 4.6% and 2.9% could correctly defined what is called a new TB case and 
re-treatment cases according to standard guideline.
CONCLUSION: The study reveals gross inadequacies in TB knowledge and management 
practices among Nigerian final year medical students. There is urgent need for 
incorporation of National TB guideline into existing undergraduate medical 
education curriculum as well as students rotation through activities in DOTS 
clinic.
