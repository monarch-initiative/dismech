PURPOSE: Pembrolizumab demonstrated durable antitumor activity in patients with 
previously treated, advanced microsatellite instability-high or mismatch 
repair-deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) tumors, including endometrial cancer, in the 
nonrandomized, open-label, multicohort, phase II KEYNOTE-158 study 
(NCT02628067). We report efficacy and safety outcomes for patients with 
MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer enrolled in KEYNOTE-158.
METHODS: Eligible patients from cohorts D (endometrial cancer, regardless of 
MSI-H/dMMR status) and K (any MSI-H/dMMR solid tumor, except colorectal) with 
previously treated, advanced MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer received 
pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 35 cycles. The primary end point was 
objective response rate per RECIST version 1.1 by independent central radiologic 
review. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free 
survival, overall survival, and safety.
RESULTS: As of October 5, 2020, 18 of 90 treated patients (20%) had completed 35 
cycles of pembrolizumab and 52 (58%) had discontinued treatment. In the efficacy 
population (patients who received ≥ 1 dose of pembrolizumab and had ≥ 26 weeks 
of follow-up; N = 79), the median time from first dose to data cutoff was 42.6 
(range, 6.4-56.1) months. The objective response rate was 48% (95% CI, 37 to 
60), and median duration of response was not reached (2.9-49.7+ months). Median 
progression-free survival was 13.1 (95% CI, 4.3 to 34.4) months, and median 
overall survival was not reached (95% CI, 27.2 months to not reached). Among all 
treated patients, 76% had ≥ 1 treatment-related adverse event (grades 3-4, 12%). 
There were no fatal treatment-related events. Immune-mediated adverse events or 
infusion reactions occurred in 28% of patients (grades 3-4, 7%; no fatal 
events).
CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab demonstrated robust and durable antitumor activity and 
encouraging survival outcomes with manageable toxicity in patients with 
previously treated, advanced MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer.
