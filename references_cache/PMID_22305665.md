In general, congenital diagnosis is based on: a) maternal serologic assays; b) 
microbiologic study of amniotic fluid or fetal blood sampling; and c) serology 
in children and microorganism detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or 
culture. Congenital infections due to cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, 
varicella, B19 erythrovirus and toxoplasmosis are usually the result of primary 
infection in the mother. Therefore, when IgG antibodies are detected before 
pregnancy, these infections are ruled out. Definitive serologic diagnosis of 
acute infection in pregnant women requires the demonstration of seroconversion 
(i.e., from seronegative to seropositive). In these cases, amniotic fluid or 
fetal blood sampling should be performed to determine the presence of 
intrauterine congenital infection. Cytomegalovirus, rubella and toxoplasmosis 
can be diagnosed by detection of specific IgM antibodies in fetal blood. 
However, PCR in amniotic fluid has replaced conventional prenatal diagnostic 
techniques, including fetal blood sampling, in the diagnosis of these 
infections. In the newborn, these infections may be confirmed by measuring IgM 
specific antibodies. B19 erythrovirus can be detected by PCR in amniotic fluid 
or fetal blood. Congenital varicella-zoster infection may be diagnosed on the 
basis of persistence of IgG antibodies after birth. Definitive diagnosis of 
herpes simplex virus infection requires viral isolation. Swabs or scraping from 
clinical specimens can be inoculated into susceptible cell lines for isolation.
