AIM: Endodontic conditions are associated with severe odontogenic infections. 
However, no studies have explicitly explored their role in the infectious 
process. This study aimed to assess associations between tooth-related and 
patient-related factors resulting in severe odontogenic infections and clinical 
care needs.
METHODOLOGY: A retrospective audit was conducted of all records of patients who 
presented with severe odontogenic infections requiring admission between 2018 
and 2023, at the largest public hospital in South Australia. Pericoronitis, 
postoperative, and non-odontogenic infections were excluded. Associations 
between tooth-related factors (type, location, presence/absence of caries, 
restorations, root canal filling, apical periodontitis, and space of infection), 
patients-related factors (diabetes and smoking statuses), clinical management 
(length of admission, intensive care unit admission number of days, and need for 
general anaesthesia) were explored. χ2, Mann-Whitney's test and Fisher's exact 
test were used for statistical analysis, and the level of statistical 
significance was set at 5%.
RESULTS: Of 382 records identified, 189 met the inclusion criteria. Mandibular 
(95.8%) molars (92.1%) were the most commonly offending teeth. Eight (4.2%) were 
root canal filled, 27 (14.3%) restored, 166 carious (87.8%), and 181 (95.8%) 
were associated with an apical radiolucency. Over half the sample were smokers 
(56.9%) and 16.4% were diabetics. The most common infection involved the 
submandibular space (56.1%). Intensive care unit admission was required for 157 
patients (83.1%), and stay depended on the space of infection, with buccal space 
having the shortest duration (median 1 day) compared with submandibular (median 
4 days) (p < .001). Need for general anaesthesia was associated with Ludwig's 
angina (n = 3, 100%) (p = .04) and submandibular space infection (n = 104, 
98.1%) (p < .001), plus intensive care unit admission (p < .001). Conversely, 
for buccal space infection, the need for general anaesthesia was lower (n = 5, 
23.8%). No further significant differences were found.
CONCLUSION: Untreated mandibular molars with apical periodontitis were the most 
frequent tooth-related findings. Results from the present study suggest 
associations between the most severe clinical presentations (Ludwig's angina and 
submandibular infection) and complexity in clinical care. Buccal space 
infections required the least complex management.
