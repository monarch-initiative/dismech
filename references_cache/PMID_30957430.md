OBJECTIVE: To estimate the annual incidence and prevalence of and frequency of 
mortality associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
METHODS: An inception cohort of patients with incident APS in 2000-2015 from a 
geographically well-defined population was identified based on comprehensive 
individual medical records review. All cases met the 2006 Sydney criteria for 
APS (primary definition) or had a diagnosis of APS confirmed by physician 
consensus (secondary definition). Levels of lupus anticoagulant, IgM and IgG 
anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies were tested in 
a centralized laboratory. Incidence rates were age- and sex-adjusted to the 2010 
US white population. Prevalence estimates were obtained from the incidence 
rates, assuming that there was no increased mortality associated with APS and 
that migration in or out of the area was independent of disease status.
RESULTS: Among this cohort in 2000-2015, 33 cases of incident APS, as defined by 
the Sydney criteria, were identified (mean age of patients 54.2 years; 55% 
female, 97% white). The annual incidence of APS in adults ages ≥18 years was 2.1 
(95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.4-2.8) per 100,000 population. Incidence 
rates were similar in both sexes. The estimated prevalence of APS was 50 (95% CI 
42-58) per 100,000 population, and was similar in both sexes. Six patients (18%) 
had a concurrent diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The most frequent 
clinical manifestation was deep vein thrombosis. The overall frequency of 
mortality among patients with APS was not significantly different from that in 
the general population (standardized mortality ratio 1.61, 95% CI 0.74-3.05).
CONCLUSION: APS occurred in ~2 persons per 100,000 population per year. The 
estimated prevalence was 50 per 100,000 population. Overall mortality was not 
notably different from that observed in the general population.
