# Protecting Households On Exposure to Newly Diagnosed Index Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients (PHOENIx MDR-TB)

## Content

The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of 26 weeks of delamanid (DLM) versus 26 weeks of isoniazid (INH) for preventing confirmed or probable active tuberculosis (TB) during 96 weeks of follow-up among high-risk household contacts (HHCs) of adults with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (index cases). High-risk HHCs are those with HIV or non-HIV immunosuppression, latent TB infection, and young children below the age of 5 years.
