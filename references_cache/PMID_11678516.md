Asthmatic attack in exercise-induced asthma is brought about by hyperventilation 
(not necessarily to exercise), cold air, and low humidity of the air breathed. 
The effects are an increase in airway resistance, damage to bronchial mucosa, 
and an increase in bronchovascular permeability. The mechanism of these changes 
is the release of mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, nitric oxide, 
sensory neuropeptides, the inhibition of neuronal activity, and bronchovascular 
permeability. The cause of asthma and exercise-induced asthma is unknown. It is 
probably an abnormality of vascular control in the peribronchium and/or an 
alteration in local adrenergic function. The importance of exercise-induced 
asthma definition and the use of stimulants in sport and antidoping in sport are 
discussed.
