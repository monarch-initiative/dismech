## Content

Despite recent campaigns for screening and the latest advances in cancer therapy and molecular biology, gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasms remain among the most frequent and lethal human tumors. Most GI neoplasms are sporadic, but there are some well-known familial syndromes associated with a significant risk of developing both benign and malignant GI tumors. Although some of these entities were described more than a century ago based on clinical grounds, the increasing molecular information obtained with high-throughput techniques has shed light on the pathogenesis of several of them. The vast amount of information gained from next-generation sequencing has led to the identification of some high-risk genetic variants, although others remain to be discovered. The opportunity for genetic assessment and counseling in these families has dramatically changed the management of these syndromes, though it has also resulted in significant psychological distress for the affected patients, especially those with indeterminate variants. Herein, we aim to summarize the most relevant hereditary cancer syndromes involving the stomach and colon, with an emphasis on new molecular findings, novel entities, and recent changes in the management of these patients.
