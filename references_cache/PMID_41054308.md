Scimitar syndrome is characterised by anomalous right pulmonary venous drainage 
to the inferior vena cava associated with right pulmonary artery hypoplasia. We 
present a case of an infant with Scimitar syndrome with a well-formed right 
pulmonary artery, in high Qp heart failure who was managed with right pulmonary 
artery banding after thorough haemodynamic evaluation.
