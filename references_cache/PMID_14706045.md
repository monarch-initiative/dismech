Not all visually sensitive patients need antiepileptic drug treatment, and even 
those who do can benefit from additional preventive measures. Visually provoked 
seizures, in particular, can be prevented or treated by avoiding or altering the 
triggering stimulus. Apart from individual preventive measures (use of specific 
television or video screens, colored glasses, etc.), prevention and warning on a 
larger scale are helpful. The choice for drug treatment will depend on the type 
of stimulus, the environment in which the person has to live and work, the 
frequency and severity of seizures, and the type of epileptic syndrome. A review 
is given of all treatment options with focus on the specific nonpharmacologic 
and pharmacologic tools used in clinical practice.
