Several lines of evidence implicate zinc finger proteins of the Gli family in 
the final steps of Hedgehog signaling in normal development and disease. 
C-terminally truncated mutant GLI3 proteins are also associated with human 
syndromes, but it is not clear whether these C-terminally truncated Gli proteins 
fulfil the same function as full-length ones. Here, structure-function analyses 
of Gli proteins have been performed using floor plate and neuronal induction 
assays in frog embryos, as well as induction of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in 
SHH-responsive mouse C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) cells. These assays show that C-terminal 
sequences are required for positive inducing activity and cytoplasmic 
localization, whereas N-terminal sequences determine dominant negative function 
and nuclear localization. Analyses of nuclear targeted Gli1 and Gli2 proteins 
suggest that both activator and dominant negative proteins are modified forms. 
In embryos and COS cells, tagged Gli cDNAs yield C-terminally deleted forms 
similar to that of Ci. These results thus provide a molecular basis for the 
human Polydactyly type A and Pallister-Hall Syndrome phenotypes, derived from 
the deregulated production of C-terminally truncated GLI3 proteins. Analyses of 
full-length Gli function in 10T1/2 cells suggest that nuclear localization of 
activating forms is a regulated event and show that only Gli1 mimics SHH in 
inducing AP activity. Moreover, full-length Gli3 and all C-terminally truncated 
forms act antagonistically whereas Gli2 is inactive in this assay. In 10T1/2 
cells, protein kinase A (PKA), a known inhibitor of Hh signaling, promotes Gli3 
repressor formation and inhibits Gli1 function. Together, these findings suggest 
a context-dependent functional divergence of Gli protein function, in which a 
cell represses Gli3 and activates Gli1/2 prevents the formation of repressor Gli 
forms to respond to Shh. Interpretation of Hh signals by Gli proteins therefore 
appears to involve a fine balance of divergent functions within each and among 
different Gli proteins, the misregulation of which has profound biological 
consequences.
