# High-Resolution Spatial Map of the Human Facial Sebaceous Gland Reveals Marker Genes and Decodes Sebocyte Differentiation [MERFISH]

## Content

The sebaceous gland is essential for skin homeostasis by producing sebum to lubricate and protect the skin. However, its cellular and molecular mechanisms in humans remain poorly understood as most studies have been conducted in mouse models. This study provides a comprehensive molecular analysis of the human sebaceous gland, focusing on cellular interactions, novel gene markers, and sebocyte differentiation. By integrating Stereo-seq spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and validation though MERFISH, we identified four distinct stages of sebocyte differentiation, each characterized by unique gene signatures. These results reveal sebocyte differentiation as a dynamic and complex process. Our findings enhance the understanding of sebaceous gland biology and provide a valuable reference for future research and the development of therapies for sebaceous gland-related disorders, including acne.
