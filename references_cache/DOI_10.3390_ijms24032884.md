## Content

Bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis (BRHP) is an interstitial lung disease induced by avian proteins. The immunopathological pathways involved in the disease are still unknown. This study assesses the cellular immune response and the cytokine pattern in a mouse model of BRHP. On days −3 and −1, mice were intraperitoneally sensitized with commercial pigeon serum (PS) or saline. Intranasal instillations with PS or saline were carried out on three consecutive days/week over either 3 weeks (Group 1) or 12 weeks (Group 2). Leukocyte and cytokine patterns in lung tissue and pulmonary inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were analysed. Both groups presented increases in resident monocytes, interstitial macrophages and type 2 dendritic cells (DCs), but also reductions in inflammatory monocytes, alveolar macrophages and tolerogenic DCs compared with their control groups. Group 1 had increased levels of eosinophils and T cells with reductions in neutrophils and B cells, while Group 2 showed high levels of B cells. Both groups exhibited increases in Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Group 2 also showed increased levels of IL-23, a Th17 cytokine. Increased levels of neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes were observed in BAL samples of both groups compared with controls. In the first stages of BRHP, there is a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response, while during the progression of the disease, although there is a Th1 response, the cytokine levels seem to indicate a switch towards a Th2/Th17 mixed response.
