One of the most consistent findings in multiple sclerosis (MS) is that 
development of MS is linked with carriage of the class II human leucocyte 
antigen (HLA) molecule HLA-DRB1*15:01; around 60 % of Caucasian MS patients 
carry this allele compared to 25-30 % of ethnically matched healthy individuals. 
However, other HLA molecules have also been linked to the development of MS. In 
this chapter, the association between different HLA types and susceptibility to 
MS will be reviewed, and other linkages between the carriage of specific HLA 
molecules and clinical and experimental findings in MS will be considered.
