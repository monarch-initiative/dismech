BACKGROUND: Although China has eliminated indigenous malaria, imported cases, 
particularly among young and middle-aged workers returning from Africa, 
constitute a major challenge for current epidemic prevention and control. In 
contrast, imported malaria in children is extremely rare and often subject to 
diagnostic delays in non-endemic areas due to atypical clinical presentations.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 2-year-11-month-old boy who returned 
from Sudan, a malaria-endemic region, presenting with fever and diarrhea as the 
initial symptoms. The case was identified by the laboratory through the blood 
routine re-examination rules, crucially informed by the patient's 
epidemiological history. The diagnosis was ultimately confirmed as Plasmodium 
falciparum malaria by rapid diagnostic testing and microscopic examination.
CONCLUSION: This diagnostic pathway exemplifies a closed-loop model of "clinical 
suspicion → targeted laboratory testing → definitive pathogen identification." 
It provides a practical framework for the early detection and diagnosis of 
pediatric imported malaria with atypical presentations in non-endemic areas.
