BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in 
children. Although primary enucleation continues to be a standard treatment for 
advanced disease, specific histopathologic high-risk features substantially 
increase the likelihood of extraocular dissemination. Adjuvant chemotherapy aims 
to reduce this risk; however, evidence from middle-income countries remains 
limited.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of histopathologic high-risk features in 
enucleated retinoblastoma and to assess relapse risk and event-free survival 
(EFS) among patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analytical study of children with 
unilateral retinoblastoma treated with primary enucleation and of those with 
bilateral disease in whom the more affected eye was enucleated before any 
therapy, between January 2008 and December 2018. Patients presenting high-risk 
histopathologic features received adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, 
etoposide, and carboplatin (VEC). EFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method and compared using the log-rank test.
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were included; 74 (73%) had unilateral disease. 
The mean age at diagnosis was 2.1 years. Most eyes demonstrated advanced 
intraocular involvement (International Classification of Intraocular 
Retinoblastoma (ICRB) Group E: 82, 81.2%; Group D: 13, 12.9%). Histopathologic 
high-risk features were common: choroidal invasion occurred in 42 (41.6%) (17, 
40.4% massive ≥3 mm), postlaminar optic nerve invasion in 11 (26.2%), and 
positive optic nerve margin in 16 (38%). Scleral invasion was identified in 20 
(21.5%), and anterior chamber invasion in 14 (14%). Thirteen patients (13%) 
relapsed, all with fatal outcomes. Ten-year EFS was 83.3%. Massive choroidal 
invasion, scleral invasion, and postlaminar optic nerve invasion were the 
strongest predictors of poor outcome, and their coexistence was associated with 
the highest relapse risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Histopathologic high-risk features are common among children 
undergoing enucleation for advanced retinoblastoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy is 
warranted in cases with massive choroidal invasion, scleral infiltration, or 
postlaminar optic nerve involvement, given their strong association with 
metastatic relapse.
