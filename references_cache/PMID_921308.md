Crohn's disease in childhood.

O'Donoghue DP, Dawson AM.

In 32 patients with Crohn's disease which started in childhood, abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea, and weight loss were the common presenting symptoms, but unexplained 
fever and failure to grow were also prominent. Stunted growth was the most 
frequent physical abnormality when first seen in hospital. The mean delay in 
diagnosis was almost 3 years and the principal contributing factor here was 
failure to consider the diagnosis and thus perform a barium follow-through 
examination. The cumulative relapse rate after medical therapy or surgical 
resection was disappointingly high, but because the median relapse time is much 
longer for surgically treated patients, surgery is recommended at an early 
stage, especially in those patients who are growth-retarded or whose education 
is suffering because of time lost from school.
