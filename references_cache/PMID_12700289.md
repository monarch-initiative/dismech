Primitive reflexes are typically present in childhood, suppressed during normal 
development, and may reappear with diseases of the brain, particularly those 
affecting the frontal lobes. In this review we discuss some historical aspects 
surrounding these reflexes, how they might be elicited and interpreted, and 
their potential clinical utility in modern neurological practice.
