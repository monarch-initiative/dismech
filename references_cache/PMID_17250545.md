Vitiligo is the most common depigmenting disorder, which affects 0.5-1% of the 
worldwide population, causing disfigurement and serious disturbances in well 
being. There is a current lack of consensus in definition and methods of 
assessment of this disorder, which makes it generally impossible to compare the 
outcomes of different studies of the same treatment. This report summarizes the 
work carried out by the Vitiligo European Task Force to propose a consensus 
definition of the disease and to assess treatment outcomes using a system which 
combines analysis of extent, stage of disease (staging), and disease progression 
(spreading). In summary, extent is evaluated using the rule of 9. Staging is 
based on cutaneous and hair pigmentation in vitiligo patches, and the disease is 
staged 0-3 (revised version) on the largest macule in each body region, except 
hands and feet, which are assessed separately and globally as one unique area. 
Assessment of spreading is based on Wood's lamp examination of the same largest 
macule in each body area. Wood's lamp is useful for a combined assessment of 
staging and spreading in the same selected area. This study reports a workshop 
which validated the clinical use of the assessment form performed at several 
European University clinics, and showed an overall good concordance among 
panelists using the proposed scoring system. This system can be easily handled 
in clinical practice. However, variations between scorer profiles indicate a 
need for training to decrease interobserver variability. Further steps are 
envisaged, namely: (i) build a global index including staging and spreading for 
the initial assessment of vitiligo patients, usable as a guidance for 
therapeutic indications and prognosis, which could be interpreted as an 
equivalent of the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) system for cancer; (ii) 
implement large-scale tests necessary for clinical trials (to check 
reproducibility and sensitivity); (iii) carry out studies of automated devices 
to assess extent more accurately; (iv) set up a teaching tool for scoring 
vitiligo, which could be posted on a website; and (v) set up an international 
conference on classifying, staging and scoring vitiligo, through the IFPCS 
Special Interest Group on Vitiligo.
