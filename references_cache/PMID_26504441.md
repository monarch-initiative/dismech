Down Syndrome with Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect, Hypertrophic 
Cardiomyopathy, and Pulmonary Vein Stenosis.

Mahadevaiah G, Gupta M, Ashwath R.

The prevalence of congenital heart disease in infants with Down syndrome is 40%, 
compared with 0.3% in children who have normal chromosomes. Atrioventricular and 
ventricular septal defects are often associated with chromosomal aberrations, 
such as in trisomy 21, whereas hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is chiefly thought to 
be secondary to specific gene mutations. We found only one reported case of 
congenital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and atrioventricular septal defect in an 
infant with Down syndrome. Here, we report atrioventricular septal defect, 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary vein stenosis in a neonate with Down 
syndrome-an apparently unique combination. In addition, we discuss the relevant 
medical literature.
