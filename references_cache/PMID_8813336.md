Cytokines participate in many physiological processes including the regulation 
of immune and inflammatory responses. These effector molecules are produced 
transiently and locally controlling the amplitude and duration of the response. 
A variety of experiments has shown that excessive or insufficient production may 
significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of a range of diseases. 
Particularly cytokines released by CD4+ T cells at the onset of an immune 
response are thought to be decisive for pathological or physiological 
consequences. The meeting in Budapest was focussed on cytokines known to 
contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases 
and allograft rejection (e.g., IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha and 
IFN-alpha, -beta, -gamma). A central role for IFN-gamma in autoimmunity was 
suggested by blocking experiments in vivo using monoclonal antibodies and 
soluble forms of the IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma SR). These agents ameliorated 
disease development in a variety of experimental autoimmune diseases in rodents. 
In a mouse model for the human disease Myasthenia gravis, IFN-alpha was found to 
reduce both the incidence and progression of the disease. Treatment of R. 
aurantiacus-infected mice with anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was 
reported to interfere with the regression of granulomas in spleen and liver, 
most likely through inadequate IL-4-mediated suppression of IFN-gamma 
production. In addition, it was shown that mice with disrupted IFN-gamma R genes 
died rapidly after infection with the BCG strain of M. bovis, whereas normal 
mice survived the infection. IL-12 was found to be the main inductor of 
IFN-gamma during the lethal Shwartzman reaction. TNF-alpha was identified as the 
principal cause of mortality after the second injection with LPS. In a variety 
of studies examining the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of AIDS, much 
attention was given to the in vitro effects of HIV-1 and/or the HIV-1 viral 
membrane protein gp120 on triggering cytokine production by peripheral blood 
leukocytes (PBLs) and purified monocytes/macrophages (Mø) originating from 
healthy donors. Gp120 as a sole agent significantly suppressed IFN-gamma 
production by mitogen-stimulated PBLs and induced the production of IFN-alpha in 
cultures of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In a human 
macrophage cell line, TNF-alpha exerted a stimulatory effect on viral 
replication and programmed cell death induced by HIV-1 which was potentiated by 
the simultaneous incubation with IFN-gamma. Upon transfection of human PBLs and 
CD4+ T cells with a retroviral vector encoding human IFN-beta, a notable 
reduction in reverse transcriptase activity after HIV-1 challenge was observed. 
Gp120 was also found to induce both IL-6 and TNF-alpha expression and to induce 
morphological changes reminiscent for apoptosis in primary astrocytes and in a 
re-aggregated human brain cell model, suggesting a role for these cytokines in 
the neuropathology of AIDS dementia. Moreover, data were presented indicating 
that cytokine-induced expression of cell adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1) in 
HIV-1 infected U 937 cells leads to high level incorporation of this molecule in 
the membrane of the viral progeny which may play a role in the attachment of 
such virions to CD4-negative cells.
