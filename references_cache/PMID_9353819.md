Although the incidence of clinical HBV has declined as a result of infection 
control measures and vaccine-induced immunity, the prevalence of patients who 
are HBsAg-positive has increased. HCWs who are exposed to the blood and body 
fluids of patients should be required to receive hepatitis B vaccine. However, 
there is no vaccine against HCV, the most prevalent bloodborne pathogen in the 
health care setting. It therefore is critical for health care workers to 
encourage the development and assessment of effective preventive and control 
strategies, including the design and use of safe devices, targeted interventions 
based on occupation-specific hazards, and surveillance and analysis of exposures 
in the health care setting.
