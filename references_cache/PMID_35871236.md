BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a primary malignancy of the biliary 
tract with a dismal prognosis. Recently, several actionable genetic aberrations 
were identified with significant enrichment in intrahepatic CCA, including FGFR2 
gene fusions with a prevalence of 10-15%. Recent clinical data demonstrate that 
these fusions are druggable in a second-line setting in advanced/metastatic 
disease and the efficacy in earlier lines of therapy is being evaluated in 
ongoing clinical trials. This scenario warrants standardised molecular profiling 
of these tumours.
METHODS: A detailed analysis of the original genetic data from the FIGHT-202 
trial, on which the approval of Pemigatinib was based, was conducted.
RESULTS: Comparing different detection approaches and displaying representative 
cases, we described the genetic landscape and architecture of FGFR2 fusions in 
iCCA and show biological and technical aspects to be considered for their 
detection. We elaborated parameters, including a suggestion for annotation, that 
should be stated in a molecular diagnostic FGFR2 report to allow a complete 
understanding of the analysis performed and the information provided.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a detailed presentation and dissection of the 
technical and biological aspects regarding FGFR2 fusion detection, which aims to 
support molecular pathologists, pathologists and clinicians in diagnostics, 
reporting of the results and decision-making.
