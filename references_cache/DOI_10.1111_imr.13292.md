## Content

SummaryFrom studies of individual families to global collaborative efforts, the NLRP3 inflammasome is now recognized to be a key regulator of innate immunity. Activated by a panoply of pathogen‐associated and endogenous triggers, NLRP3 serves as an intracellular sensor that drives carefully coordinated assembly of the inflammasome, and downstream inflammation mediated by IL‐1 and IL‐18. Initially discovered as the cause of the autoinflammatory spectrum of cryopyrin‐associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), NLRP3 is now also known to play a role in more common diseases including cardiovascular disease, gout, and liver disease. We have seen cohesion in results from clinical studies in CAPS patients, ex vivo studies of human cells and murine cells, and in vivo murine models leading to our understanding of the downstream pathways, cytokine secretion, and cell death pathways that has solidified the role of autoinflammation in the pathogenesis of human disease. Recent advances in our understanding of the structure of the inflammasome have provided ways for us to visualize normal and mutant protein function and pharmacologic inhibition. The subsequent development of targeted therapies successfully used in the treatment of patients with CAPS completes the bench to bedside translational loop which has defined the study of this unique protein.
