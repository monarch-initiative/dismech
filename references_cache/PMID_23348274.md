Pfeiffer syndrome (PS) (MIM 101600) is one of the most common syndromic forms of 
craniosynostosis. It is characterized by craniosysnostosis, midface hypoplasia, 
broad and medially deviated thumbs, and great toes with partial syndactyly of 
the digits. Here, we described clinical and genetic features of 12 unrelated 
Thai individuals with PS. All 12 patients were sporadic, and advanced paternal 
age was found in 50% of the cases. Polymerase chain reaction sequencing of FGFR1 
exon 5 and FGFR2 exons 8, 10, 15, 16, and 17 was performed in all PS patients 
and revealed 9 recurrent mutations in all patients. Most of the mutations 
clustered in exons 8 and 10 (9/12) accounting for 75% of PS cases. The most 
frequently detected mutation, p.S351C, was associated with the severe form of PS 
in the Thai population. Less frequent mutations in exons 16 (p.K641R) and 17 
(p.G663E) were also identified. In addition, the p.P252R mutation in FGFR1 was 
detected in 1 PS patient with unilateral coronal craniosynostosis expanding the 
phenotypic spectrum of PS with this particular mutation. Knowing the mutation 
spectrum of the responsible genes could lead to the most effective strategy in 
identifying mutations causing Pfeiffer syndrome in the Thai population.
