First described in Japan in 1967, Kawasaki disease is now observed in all 
countries. Despite extensive research, the aetiology of this infectious disease 
which affects mainly infants and young children remains mysterious. The six main 
clinical presentations of Kawasaki disease are: prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, 
lesions of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa, inflammatory reddening and swelling 
of the hands and feet, skin rash and cervical lymph node enlargement. Laboratory 
data show an inflammatory syndrome and thrombocytosis. The disease usually 
resolves within a few weeks. The major risk is cardiovascular involvement with 
pericarditis, myocarditis and, chiefly, coronary artery aneurysms which usually 
regress but are the main cause of mortality (1 to 2 p. 100 of the cases). 
Treatment consists of gammaglobulins and aspirin in high doses; when 
administered at an early stage, it prevents the formation of coronary aneurysms.
