Fatigue is a frequent symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) that can interfere with 
a patient's daily functioning. The cause of MS fatigue, its clinical 
characteristics, and its relationship to other symptoms remain poorly 
understood. Structured interviews were conducted with 32 patients with MS and 33 
normal healthy adults. Fatigue proved to be both more frequent and more severe 
among the patients with MS. Multiple sclerosis fatigue was unrelated to either 
depression or global impairment. Multiple sclerosis fatigue appears to be a 
distinct clinical entity, often disabling, that can be distinguished from normal 
fatigue, affective disturbance, and neurologic impairment.
