LVDD as an early measure of myocardial end-organ damage is commonly associated 
with hypertension and may well precede development of LVH in hypertension. About 
half of the patients presenting with heart failure have a normal ejection 
fraction, a clinical syndrome that is commonly referred to as HFPEF or diastolic 
heart failure and is commonly associated with impaired LV relaxation and 
increased diastolic stiffness. DD and HFPEF are commonly associated with 
advancing age and hypertension and increase in prevalence in association with 
these conditions, but there is a paucity of data on any specific therapeutic 
regimen. Hypertension control appears to be the most effective strategy in 
improving diastolic function and possibly for reducing the morbidity and 
mortality associated with HFPEF.
