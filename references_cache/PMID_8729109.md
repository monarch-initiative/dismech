Abnormally high levels of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are a feature in 
nine of the fifteen peroxisomal disorders that have been identified so far. 
Saturated VLCFA accumulate in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, appear to disrupt 
membrane structure, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of a brain 
inflammatory response. Dietary therapy initiated when patients are still 
asymptomatic may be of clinical benefit.
