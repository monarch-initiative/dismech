In addition to the abnormal movements most commonly associated with HD, 
cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms occur in almost all patients. 
These behavioral symptoms contribute to morbidity and augment what is often an 
overwhelming caregiver burden. Behavioral interventions may be useful in 
managing some HD patients with behavioral symptoms, especially irritability and 
apathy. Patients should be evaluated for underlying medical illness that might 
contribute to psychiatric symptoms, especially if onset of behavioral change is 
rapid. According to clinical observation, HD patients with psychiatric symptoms 
respond to standard pharmacotherapy. Controlled studies are needed to determine 
the true efficacy of these agents for use in treating people with HD.
