Vaccine-preventable viral hepatitis continues to be a cause of considerable 
morbidity and mortality: on worldwide basis, approximately 1.4 million cases of 
hepatitis A are reported every year. The true incidence, however, has been 
estimated to be 3-10 times higher. Regarding hepatitis B, more than a third of 
the world's population has been infected. The World Health Organization has 
estimated (2000) that there are 367 million chronic carriers of hepatitis B 
worldwide, and approximately 1 million deaths per year as a consequence of 
chronic complications and acute fulminant disease. Hepatitis B vaccines have 
been licensed since 1982, and hepatitis A vaccines since 1992. In 1996, a 
combined hepatitis A and B vaccine became available. An update on the long-term 
protection conferred by hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines as well as the 
combined hepatitis A and B vaccine is offered in this paper. Long-term efficacy 
and booster policy for hepatitis B vaccines have often been a topic of 
discussion. Based on current data and field experience there is, in general, no 
necessity for booster doses for fully vaccinated immunocompetent individuals. 
Long-term protection has been demonstrated by the rapid (5-7 days) development 
of anamnestic antibody responses among vaccinees who no longer have detectable 
anti-HBs. Anamnestic responses correlate with lymphoproliferative T-cell 
responses following challenge with hepatitis B vaccine. Furthermore, employing 
Spot-ELISA techniques, circulating B-cells were shown to be able to produce 
anti-HBs in vaccinees who lost their detectable antibodies. The accumulated data 
from a large number of studies indicate that despite antibody decline or loss, 
immune memory exhibits long-term persistence. There is somewhat less information 
available for hepatitis A vaccines, yet an increasing number of studies indicate 
that the findings for hepatitis B vaccines are also applicable to hepatitis A 
vaccines. The necessity to provide a booster dose was based on early projections 
of observed antibody levels. However, recent follow-up studies with up to 12 
year observation, as well as studies employing mathematical models predict that 
following primary vaccination, antibodies will persist for at least 25 years. In 
addition, experimental studies confirm that vaccination against hepatitis A 
induces immunological memory. Therefore hepatitis A booster vaccination is 
presently considered as unnecessary in fully vaccinated individuals. The above 
findings are of importance in the context of administering combined hepatitis A 
and B vaccine for which similar long-term data have been observed. All available 
data on monovalent and combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines indicates 
that there is no support for a hepatitis A or hepatitis B booster when a 
complete primary vaccination course is offered to immunocompetent individuals.
