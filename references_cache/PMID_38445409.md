Ludwig's angina is a severe diffuse cellulitis that presents an acute onset and 
spreads rapidly and bilaterally. It can affect the submandibular, sublingual or 
submental spaces resulting in a state of emergency. Early diagnosis and urgent 
management could be a life-saving procedure. We report a case of wide spread 
sialadenitis infection extending to the neck with trismus and elevation of the 
floor of the mouth that caused an obstruction of the airway and resulted in an 
inspiratory dyspnea and a stridor. The patient was directed to maintain the 
airway by elective tracheostomy. An appropriate use of parenteral antibiotics, 
airway protection techniques, and potential surgical drainage of the infection 
remain the standard protocol of treatment in advanced cases of Ludwig's angina. 
The aim of this case report is to emphasize on the importance of early diagnosis 
and appropriate management of Ludwig's angina.
