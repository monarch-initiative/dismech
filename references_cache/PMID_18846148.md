Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant slowly degenerative apoptotic 
condition in CNS, in particular in striatum. It is characterized by involuntary 
movements; in particular chorea, personality changes and subcortical dementia. 
About 250 persons are diagnosed in Norway with the condition at any time, most 
are diagnosed between 35 and 55 years but onset before 20 years of age can be 
seen and diagnosis in later life is not rare. The average duration is about 15 
years from diagnosis to death, but it can be considerably longer. Signs, 
symptoms and therapeutic challenges are mentioned in addition to molecular and 
clinical genetic aspects, in particular pre-symptomatic and prenatal diagnosis.
