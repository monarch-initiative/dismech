OBJECTIVE: Fungal infection of the external auditory canal, otomycosis, is 
generally a superficial, but sometimes stubborn mycotic infection that rarely 
involves the middle ear. We designed a randomized, controlled cohort study to 
analyse the treatment effect of ear canal lavage on otomycosis.
METHODS: The clinical patients were divided into two groups: an irrigation group 
and an irrigation + local drug treatment control group. The patients were 
followed up once a month for three months.
RESULTS: From January 2022 to December 2023, a total of 102 patients treated for 
otomycosis were enrolled, and 98 of the patients were followed up for three 
months. 22 of the 98 patients (22.45%) had no or minor symptoms. Common symptoms 
such as pruritus, pain, hearing impairment, etc., presented solely or in 
combination. Our fungal culture results revealed that, in 83 patients (84.69%), 
the otomycotic pathogen was Aspergillus, in 3 patients (3.06%) it was 
Penicillium, in 2 patients (2.04%) it was Candida species, and in the remaining 
13 patients (13.27%) it was negative. There were 3 patients (3.06%) with a 
mixture of fungal culture reports. In the lavage group, 48 (48/52, 92.30%) 
patients were cured with initial treatment after three months of follow-up, two 
(2/52, 3.85%) patients were cured after one month but were lost to follow-up 
after three months, and two (2/52, 3.85%) patients failed after initial 
treatment, received topical miconazole ointment treatment and were eventually 
cured. In the irrigation + local drug control group, 48 (48/50, 96.00%) subjects 
responded to initial treatment without recurrent disease after three months; 2 
(2/50, 4.00%) subjects were lost to follow-up. According to Fisher's exact test, 
there was no significant difference in treatment efficiency between the two 
groups (P = 0.258).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the diagnosis of otomycosis requires 
vigilance from clinicians given its nonspecific or minor symptoms. Both ear 
canal rinses and local antifungal creams are effective, and sequential treatment 
via both methods is reasonable.
