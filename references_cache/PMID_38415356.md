BACKGROUND: Germline HRAS gain-of-function pathogenic variants cause Costello 
syndrome (CS). During early childhood, 50% of patients develop multifocal atrial 
tachycardia, a treatment-resistant tachyarrhythmia of unknown pathogenesis. This 
study investigated how overactive HRAS activity triggers arrhythmogenesis in 
atrial-like cardiomyocytes (ACMs) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem 
cells bearing CS-associated HRAS variants.
METHODS: HRAS Gly12 mutations were introduced into a human-induced pluripotent 
stem cells-ACM reporter line. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells were 
generated from patients with CS exhibiting tachyarrhythmia. Calcium transients 
and action potentials were assessed in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
ACMs. Automated patch clamping assessed funny currents. HCN inhibitors targeted 
pacemaker-like activity in mutant ACMs. Transcriptomic data were analyzed via 
differential gene expression and gene ontology. Immunoblotting evaluated protein 
expression associated with calcium handling and pacemaker-nodal expression.
RESULTS: ACMs harboring HRAS variants displayed higher beating rates compared 
with healthy controls. The hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated 
potassium channel inhibitor ivabradine and the Nav1.5 blocker flecainide 
significantly decreased beating rates in mutant ACMs, whereas voltage-gated 
calcium channel 1.2 blocker verapamil attenuated their irregularity. 
Electrophysiological assessment revealed an increased number of pacemaker-like 
cells with elevated funny current densities among mutant ACMs. Mutant ACMs 
demonstrated elevated gene expression (ie, ISL1, TBX3, TBX18) related to 
intracellular calcium homeostasis, heart rate, RAS signaling, and induction of 
pacemaker-nodal-like transcriptional programming. Immunoblotting confirmed 
increased protein levels for genes of interest and suppressed MAPK 
(mitogen-activated protein kinase) activity in mutant ACMs.
CONCLUSIONS: CS-associated gain-of-function HRASG12 mutations in induced 
pluripotent stem cells-derived ACMs trigger transcriptional changes associated 
with enhanced automaticity and arrhythmic activity consistent with multifocal 
atrial tachycardia. This is the first human-induced pluripotent stem cell model 
establishing the mechanistic basis for multifocal atrial tachycardia in CS.
