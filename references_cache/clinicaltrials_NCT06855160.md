# A Phase 3a, Open-Label, Randomized, Controlled Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity and Safety of Intramuscular Administration of an Investigational Varicella Vaccine and Priorix Compared With Subcutaneous Administration of Varivax and Priorix, When Given as a First Dose to Healthy Children 12 to 15 Months of Age

## Content

This study aims to assess the immune response and safety of GSK's candidate chickenpox and marketed MMR vaccines when given to children 12 to 15 months of age via a muscle injection. It compares the GSK vaccines to Merck's chickenpox vaccine, administered just under the skin. Additionally, the study will evaluate the immune response and safety of giving the GSK vaccines along with other childhood vaccines through a muscle injection.
