There is evidence that the overall prevalence of asthma is increasing in the 
general population. Asthma is the leading cause of chronic illness and the most 
common chronic respiratory disorder in children. Given sufficient exercise 
intensity, exercise can trigger acute exacerbations in virtually all individuals 
with asthma. Heat loss, water loss, postexertional airway rewarming, and the 
role of several mediators have been proposed as possible mechanisms responsible 
for the airway obstruction induced by exercise. Exercise-induced asthma can be 
easily diagnosed and treated in the majority of patients. Physical training 
should be part of the asthmatic patient's overall plan of management. When 
properly treated, asthmatic individuals should be able to participate or compete 
in the majority of sports.
