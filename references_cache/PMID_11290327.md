Rifampicin (Rif) is one of the most potent and broad spectrum antibiotics 
against bacterial pathogens and is a key component of anti-tuberculosis therapy, 
stemming from its inhibition of the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). We 
determined the crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNAP complexed with 
Rif. The inhibitor binds in a pocket of the RNAP beta subunit deep within the 
DNA/RNA channel, but more than 12 A away from the active site. The structure, 
combined with biochemical results, explains the effects of Rif on RNAP function 
and indicates that the inhibitor acts by directly blocking the path of the 
elongating RNA when the transcript becomes 2 to 3 nt in length.
