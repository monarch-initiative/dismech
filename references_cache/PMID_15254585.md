Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a common X-linked disease characterized by 
widespread muscle damage that invariably leads to paralysis and death. There is 
currently no therapy for this disease. Here we report that a subpopulation of 
circulating cells expressing AC133, a well-characterized marker of hematopoietic 
stem cells, also expresses early myogenic markers. Freshly isolated, circulating 
AC133(+) cells were induced to undergo myogenesis when cocultured with myogenic 
cells or exposed to Wnt-producing cells in vitro and when delivered in vivo 
through the arterial circulation or directly into the muscles of transgenic 
scid/mdx mice (which allow survival of human cells). Injected cells also 
localized under the basal lamina of host muscle fibers and expressed satellite 
cell markers such as M-cadherin and MYF5. Furthermore, functional tests of 
injected muscles revealed a substantial recovery of force after treatment. As 
these cells can be isolated from the blood, manipulated in vitro, and delivered 
through the circulation, they represent a possible tool for future cell therapy 
applications in DMD disease or other muscular dystrophies.
