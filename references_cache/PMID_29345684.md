PURPOSE: An association of Lynch syndrome (LS) with breast cancer has been long 
suspected; however, there have been insufficient data to address this question 
for each of the LS genes individually.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of personal and family history in 
423 women with pathogenic or likely pathogenic germ-line variants in MLH1 
(N = 65), MSH2 (N = 94), MSH6 (N = 140), or PMS2 (N = 124) identified via 
clinical multigene hereditary cancer testing. Standard incidence ratios (SIRs) 
of breast cancer were calculated by comparing breast cancer frequencies in our 
study population with those in the general population (Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results 18 data).
RESULTS: When evaluating by gene, the age-standardized breast cancer risks for 
MSH6 (SIR = 2.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.56-2.86) and PMS2 (SIR = 2.92; 
95% CI, 2.17-3.92) were associated with a statistically significant risk for 
breast cancer whereas no association was observed for MLH1 (SIR = 0.87; 95% CI, 
0.42-1.83) or MSH2 (SIR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.06).
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that two LS genes, MSH6 and PMS2, are 
associated with an increased risk for breast cancer and should be considered 
when ordering genetic testing for individuals who have a personal and/or family 
history of breast cancer.
