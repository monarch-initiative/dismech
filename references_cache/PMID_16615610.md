Endemic treponematoses including yaws, bejel, pinta are distinguished from 
venereal syphilis on the basis of epidemiological characteristics and clinical 
manifestations. They cannot be differentiated by morphological and serological 
methods. A few minor genetic differences have been identified among the 
subspecies (Treponema pallidum sp. pallidum, pertenue, endemicum, carateum). 
Although penicillin therapy is effective, these infectious diseases have yet to 
be eliminated.
