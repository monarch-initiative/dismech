Invasive Listeria monocytogenes infections carry a high mortality despite 
antibiotic treatment. The rareness of the infection makes it difficult to 
improve antibiotic treatment through randomized clinical trials. This 
observational study investigated clinical features and outcome of invasive 
L. monocytogenes infections including the efficacy of empiric and definitive 
antibiotic therapies. Demographic, clinical and biochemical findings, antibiotic 
treatment and 30-day mortality for all episodes of L. monocytogenes bacteraemia 
and/or meningitis were collected by retrospective medical record review in the 
North Denmark Region and the Capital Region of Denmark (17 hospitals) from 1997 
to 2012. Risk factors for 30-day all-cause mortality were assessed by logistic 
regression. The study comprised 229 patients (median age: 71 years), 172 
patients had bacteraemia, 24 patients had meningitis and 33 patients had both. 
Significant risk factors for 30-day mortality were septic shock (OR 3.0, 95% CI 
1.4-6.4), altered mental state (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7-7.6) and inadequate empiric 
antibiotic therapy (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.8-8.1). Cephalosporins accounted for 90% of 
inadequately treated cases. Adequate definitive antibiotic treatment was 
administered to 195 patients who survived the early period (benzylpenicillin 72, 
aminopenicillin 84, meropenem 28, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 6, and 
piperacillin/tazobactam 5). Definitive antibiotic treatment with 
benzylpenicillin or aminopenicillin resulted in a lower 30-day mortality in an 
adjusted analysis compared with meropenem (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.8). In 
conclusion, inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy and definitive therapy with 
meropenem were both associated with significantly higher 30-day mortality.
