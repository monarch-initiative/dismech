In this study the coagglutination test for the rapid diagnosis of cholera is 
evaluated in comparison with the conventional culture method. A total of 553 
stool specimens were processed from cases of acute gastro-enteritis. The 
sensitivity and specificity of coagglutination test was 92.77% and 95.65% 
respectively. The coagglutination test is found to be simple, reliable and rapid 
method for the diagnosis of cholera.
