The Libman and Sacks non bacterial endocarditis was reported in 1924 in patients 
with SLE. Its relation to the anti cardiolpin syndrome has only been described 
as recently as the last decade. In this paper we review the deposition of these 
antibodies on the valve with complement components initiating the deformation of 
the valve. The valvulopathy in APS is quite common and may lead to valve 
replacement. In addition, a diversity of manifestations are detailed. More 
awareness should be drawn to this new complication of APS.
