Felty's syndrome (FS) consists of the triad: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
leukopenia and splenomegaly. FS occurs in approximately 1% of patients with RA. 
In this syndrome, the risk of infection is increased and anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia and cutaneous ulcers are more frequently observed. The 
literature is reviewed on the basis of a case history. The pathogenesis is 
unknown but is probably multifactorial. Cell antibodies, increased occurrence of 
immune complexes, inhibited neutrophil production, altered neutrophil 
distribution and reduced neutrophil function have been observed. The main 
indication for treatment is present if the patient has severe neutropenia (less 
than 0.1 x 10(9)/l) and repeated infections. Various methods of treatment are 
available. The most important are: gold, low-dose methotrexate, lithium, 
methylprednisolone pulse therapy, penicillamine and splenectomy. According to 
the literature, conventional steroid treatment cannot be recommended.
