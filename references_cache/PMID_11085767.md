Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are a new class of drugs for asthma 
treatment, available in tablet form. Their unique mechanism of action results in 
a combination of both bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects. While their 
optimal place in asthma management is still under review, LTRA represent an 
important advance in asthma pharmacotherapy.
