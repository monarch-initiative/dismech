Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for nearly half 
of all heart failure cases and is characterized by phenotypical heterogeneity 
with a high prevalence of multiple, often overlapping cardiometabolic disorders. 
Comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, or diabetes are present in many 
HFpEF patients and are hypothesized to contribute to adverse cardiac remodelling 
and myocardial fibrosis through a variety of haemodynamic and metabolic 
impairments, with nearly half of all HFpEF patients exhibiting left ventricular 
(LV) hypertrophy or concentric remodelling. Myocardial fibrosis and its 
surrogate changes in LV structure and geometry lead to functional impairments 
such as increased diastolic stiffness and elevated filling pressures and are 
associated with reduced exercise tolerance and poor prognosis in patients with 
HFpEF. Despite recent therapeutic progress, there are currently no 
evidence-based therapies mechanistically focusing solely on myocardial fibrosis 
and LV hypertrophy in HFpEF. Recognizing myocardial fibrosis and LV hypertrophy 
as key features of the heterogeneous HFpEF pathophysiology may contribute to the 
development of promising targets for future clinical trials. This review 
elaborates on the pathophysiological role of fibrotic remodelling and LV 
hypertrophy in HFpEF, outlines contemporary diagnostic standards, and discusses 
emerging therapeutic strategies, aiming at directly modulating myocardial 
fibrosis and hypertrophy in HFpEF.
