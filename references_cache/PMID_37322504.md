Mendelian randomization indicates that atopic dermatitis contributes to the occurrence of diabetes.

Background: An association between atopic dermatitis (AD), a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, and diabetes mellitus (DM) has been suggested. The causality underlying the relationship has not been confirmed. Methods: We used summary statistics from the largest to date genome-wide association studies for AD and DM outcomes. Inverse-variance weighted was the primary analysis method. We also performed sensitivity analyses. Results: Genetically predicted AD led to a higher risk of T2D (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.11; P = 0.003). No causal association was found for type 1 diabetes mellitus. In sensitivity analyses, reverse MR indicated no causal effect of T2D on AD. Conclusion: This study suggests that AD is a risk factor for T2D but not for type 1 diabetes, indicating a causal relationship between AD and T2D.
