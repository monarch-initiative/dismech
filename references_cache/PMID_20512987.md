Although threshold levels for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis 
B e antigen (HBeAg) titers have recently been proposed to guide therapy for 
chronic hepatitis B (CHB), their relationship to circulating hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) DNA and intrahepatic HBV replicative intermediates, and the significance 
of emerging viral variants, remains unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis 
that HBsAg and HBeAg titers may vary independently of viral replication in vivo. 
In all, 149 treatment-naïve CHB patients were recruited (HBeAg-positive, n = 71; 
HBeAg-negative, n = 78). Quantification of HBeAg and HBsAg was performed by 
enzyme immunoassay. Virological characterization included serum HBV DNA load, 
HBV genotype, basal core promoter (BCP)/precore (PC) sequence, and, in a subset 
(n = 44), measurement of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) 
and total HBV DNA, as well as quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) staining 
for HBsAg. In HBeAg-positive CHB, HBsAg was positively correlated with serum HBV 
DNA and intrahepatic cccDNA and total HBV DNA (r = 0.69, 0.71, 0.76, P < 0.01). 
HBeAg correlated with serum HBV DNA (r = 0.60, P < 0.0001), although emerging 
BCP/PC variants reduced HBeAg titer independent of viral replication. In 
HBeAg-negative CHB, HBsAg correlated poorly with serum HBV DNA (r = 0.28, P = 
0.01) and did not correlate with intrahepatic cccDNA nor total HBV DNA. 
Quantitative IHC for hepatocyte HBsAg confirmed a relationship with viral 
replication only in HBeAg-positive patients.
CONCLUSION: The correlation between quantitative HBsAg titer and serum and 
intrahepatic markers of HBV replication differs between patients with 
HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB. HBeAg titers may fall independent of 
viral replication as HBeAg-defective variants emerge prior to HBeAg 
seroconversion. These findings provide new insights into viral pathogenesis and 
have practical implications for the use of quantitative serology as a clinical 
biomarker.
