Thyrotoxicosis, commonly seen in a condition with Graves' disease, causes 
increased bone absorption and results in osteoporosis with increased bone 
turnover. The osteoporotic state is dominant in cortical bones with slight 
impairment of calcium-homeostasis, although the precise mechanism is still 
elusive. It ought to be recovered in accordance with the amelioration of thyroid 
hormone status, but past history of thyrotoxicosis might cause bone fragility, 
especially in post-menopausal or senile patients.
