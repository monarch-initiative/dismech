Melanocytic nevi occurring in lymph nodes create diagnostic difficulty by 
mimicking metastases. Few studies describe nodal nevi in sentinel lymph nodes 
(SLNs) excised for melanoma. We evaluated 72 cases in which patients had 
undergone SLN biopsy for melanoma. Lymph nodes and cutaneous melanomas were 
evaluated according to a standard protocol. Nodal nevi were identified in 8 
patients (11%). Of these, 6 (75%) had an associated cutaneous nevus (P = .006). 
Of 21 patients with an associated nevus, 4 (19%) with nodal nevi had a cutaneous 
nevus with congenital features (P = .01). The incidence of nodal nevus 
correlated with a Breslow thickness greater than 2.5 mm (P = .02). Nevi were not 
seen in non-SLNs. Nodal nevi appear more frequently in patients with 
melanoma-associated cutaneous nevi, particularly if congenital features are 
present. The increased frequency of nodal nevi in SLNs relative to non-SLNs 
suggests an etiology of mechanical transport of nevus cells.
