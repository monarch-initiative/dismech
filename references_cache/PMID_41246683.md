Refeeding syndrome potentially causes death from refeeding-induced central 
nervous system disorders, such as hypoglycemic encephalopathy, Wernicke 
encephalopathy, and hypophosphatemic encephalopathy. However, there is no 
established management for malnourished patients with this refeeding-induced 
central nervous system syndrome. We report a case of successful neurological 
critical care for refeeding-induced central nervous system syndrome. A 
15-year-old female with anorexia nervosa presented to our hospital after 
fainting. Her body mass index (BMI) was 8.8 kg/m². Upon arrival, her Glasgow 
Coma Scale was E4V4M6, plasma glucose was 25 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 
was 1393 U/L, and alanine transaminase was 1368 U/L. We started a continuous 5% 
dextrose. However, her Glasgow Coma Scale dropped to E4V1M1 1 hour later, and 
her plasma glucose was 28 mg/dL. We delivered her to the neurological critical 
care unit and started critical nutritional management. Her laboratory data had 
gradually improved. On day five from admission, her Glasgow Coma Scale had 
improved to G4V4M6. On day 15. She was transferred to the psychiatric 
department. In conclusion, clinicians should recognize that refeeding-induced 
central nervous system syndrome is neurologically critical and life-threatening. 
However, our management successfully improved this patient's condition. 
Additionally, she gained enough weight on day 15 after admission. Our 
moderate-calorie nutritional management might be adequate for refeeding-induced 
central nervous system syndrome. However, it is a little too exaggerated to 
conclude that our management is safe and the best nutritional management, based 
only on this case. We recommend a future observational study as the next step.
