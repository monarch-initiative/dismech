BACKGROUND: Otomycosis is a common fungal infection of the external auditory 
canal (EAC), with a higher incidence in tropical and subtropical regions. 
Epidemiological information on otomycosis in southern China is limited. This 
study aimed to characterize the clinical manifestations, otoendoscopic features, 
and pathogen distribution of otomycosis in southern China.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 192 confirmed cases of 
otomycosis among patients at a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, southern China.
RESULTS: The most common presentation was ear pruritus, followed by hearing 
loss, aural fullness, otorrhea, tinnitus, and otalgia. Unilateral infection was 
more common than bilateral infection. The EAC was the primary site affected. 
Characteristic findings included crusts, congestion, fungoid substance, exudate, 
and swelling. These features (especially crusts, congestion, swelling, and 
fungoid substance) were significantly associated with fungal positivity. Of the 
110 cases in which fungal pathogens were identified, the majority (103, 93.64%) 
were Aspergillus species including A. terreus (n = 69), A. flavus (n = 16), A. 
niger (n = 13), A. sclerotiorum (n = 2), A. oryzae (n = 1), A. sydowii (n = 1) 
and A. tamarii (n = 1); Candida species accounted for 4 isolates (3.64%), and 
one isolate each was identified for Cladophialophora, Trichophyton, and 
Scopulariopsis species (0.91%).
CONCLUSION: These findings provide region-specific insights that are crucial for 
guiding effective clinical diagnosis, prevention and empirical antifungal 
therapy. Antifungal therapy covering Aspergillus should be prioritized in this 
high-incidence area.
