Dengue is an acute febrile illness with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms 
ranging from mild to severe forms characterized by plasma leakage that can be 
fatal. NK cells are one of the main effectors in early infection and may play an 
important role in dengue pathogenesis. We investigated NK cell involvement 
during dengue infection. A higher frequency of NK cell subsets and TRAIL+NK 
cells was found in mild DF cases when compared to that in severe cases or 
healthy donors. NK activation markers such as CD107a and TLR3 were upregulated 
in patients' cells compared to those in healthy donors. In addition, IL12 
related to NK cell activation were upregulated in mild DF cases. In vitro PBMC 
culture models show that DENV-stimulated and IFNα-stimulated NK cells were able 
to express TRAIL, suggesting an indirect activation of cells, regarding TRAIL 
expression. Type I IFN receptor blockage on DENV-stimulated PBMCs showed TRAIL 
expression on NK cells is partially IFNα dependent. In addition, during PBMC 
stimulation, TRAIL expression on NK cells was inversely correlated with 
DENV-positive monocytes. Therefore, we observed DENV-induced activation of NK 
cell populations. A higher activation of NK cells would promote limited viral 
spread, resulting in decreased inflammatory response, contributing to protection 
against dengue severity.
