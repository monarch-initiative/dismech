[Genetic diagnosis of periodic diseases (familial mediterranean fever or FMF)].

[Article in French]

Touitou I.

Periodic disease is the prototype of a group of hereditary disorders 
characterised by recurrent inflammatory attacks. Since the discovery of the 
causing gene (MEFV) in 1997, three hospital laboratories in France, and around 
20 throughout the world, propose a specific genetic test, based on the search of 
the common MEFV mutations on DNA extracted from a simple blood sample. This 
strategy allows definitive confirmation of periodic disease if one mutation is 
detected on each of the two chromosomes (around 30 mutations are reported 
today), but do not exclude the diagnosis in the other cases (one or no mutation 
detected). A non-contributive test shows the existence of rare MEFV mutations, 
or the involvement of another gene responsible for inflammatory hereditary 
syndrome; important differential diagnosis to be done, because their mode of 
management may be different from that of periodic disease.
