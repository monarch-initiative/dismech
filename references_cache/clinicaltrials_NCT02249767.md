## Content

This was a double-blind, randomized, three-treatment, parallel study. Normal, healthy male and female children and adults (i.e., ages 12 to 40 years) with at least Grade 2 (i.e., mild severity) acne vulgaris were treated on the full face once daily for 84 days with the Tretinoin Gel 0.05%, Brand (tretinoin) Gel 0.05%, or Gel Vehicle. Acne lesions were graded by a single blinded observer at screening and at Weeks 0 (i.e., baseline), 2, 4, 8, and 12 at each location.
