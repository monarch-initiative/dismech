Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease 
of the central nervous system. There are neither diagnostic tests nor markers 
for MS. Other causes must be excluded thoroughly before an MS diagnosis is 
considered definitive. The relapsing-remitting type is a major clinical course 
in MS. Most disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) target this clinical type. Many 
clinical studies have demonstrated that early intervention with DMDs may prevent 
disease progression and transition from relapsing-remitting MS to the secondary 
progressive type. There are windows of opportunity for DMDs. An adequate DMD 
should be used for the appropriate patient at the optimal time.
