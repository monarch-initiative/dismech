It is important to evaluate each swan-neck deformity to determine the mobility 
and radiographic condition of the PIP joint. This information forms a basis for 
logical treatment. In those fingers with little or no loss of motion, the 
treatment alternatives include DIP joint fusions, dermadesis, or flexor 
tenodesis. With significant loss of PIP joint motion, an attempt is made to 
first restore passive motion by manipulation and lateral band or skin releases. 
It then becomes essential to restore flexor tendon excursion. In those patients 
with destroyed joint surfaces the salvage procedures of fusion and arthroplasty 
are the treatments of choice.
