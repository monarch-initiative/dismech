A 10.6 year old Turkish girl developed + the signs of a polyglandular autoimmune 
syndrome (PGA) type I since her first year of age. Apart from the endocrine and 
non-endocrine symptoms of PGA, she suffered from an acute state of illness with 
therapy-resistant fever and multiform exanthemas in the early course of disease. 
All included the criteria of Wissler-Fanconi syndrome became clear which has not 
yet been reported in association with PGA. Although this syndrome generally is 
considered an equivalent of Still's syndrome, rheumatoid symptoms could not be 
ascertained during the following 9-year-course of PGA.
