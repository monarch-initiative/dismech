Excitotoxicity refers to neuronal cell death caused by activation of excitatory 
amino acid receptors. A substantial body of evidence has implicated 
excitotoxicity as a mechanism of cell death in both acute and chronic neurologic 
diseases. A major recent advance has been the successful cloning and expression 
of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA, and metabotropic glutamate 
receptors. The cellular mechanisms responsible for cell death after activation 
of these receptors are still being clarified. In acute neurologic diseases such 
as stroke and head trauma, excitotoxicity may be related to excessive glutamate 
release. In chronic neurodegenerative diseases, however, a slow excitotoxic 
process is more likely to occur as a consequence of either a receptor 
abnormality or an impairment of energy metabolism. Recent therapeutic studies 
have demonstrated the efficacy of non-NMDA receptor antagonists in experimental 
studies of global ischemia.
