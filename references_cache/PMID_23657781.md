PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transarterial embolization of 
life-threatening arterial rupture in patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome (vEDS) in a single tertiary referral center.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed transarterial embolization for vEDS 
performed at our institution from 2000 to 2012. The indication of embolization 
was spontaneous arterial rupture or pseudoaneurysm with acute bleeding. All 
interventions used a percutaneous approach through a 5F or less introducer 
sheath. Embolic agents were microcoils and glue in 3 procedures, glue alone in 
2, and microcoils alone in 2.
RESULTS: Five consecutive vEDS patients were treated by 7 embolization 
procedures (4 women, mean age 29.8 years). All procedures were successfully 
performed. Two patients required a second procedure for newly arterial lesions 
at a different site from the first procedure. Four of the five patients were 
still alive after a mean follow-up of 19.4 (range 1-74.7) months. One patient 
died of multiple organ failure 2 days after procedure. Minor procedural 
complications were observed in 3 procedures (43 %), all directly managed during 
the same session. Remote arterial lesions occurred after 3 procedures (43 %); 
one underwent a second embolization, and the other 2 were observed 
conservatively. Puncture site complication was observed in only one procedure 
(14 %).
CONCLUSION: Embolization for vEDS is a safe and effective method to manage 
life-threatening arterial rupture.
