Retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction (R-CPD) causes an inability to belch. 
This case report describes the successful treatment of R-CPD with the use of 
hypnosis. Thereafter, the patient was able to burp small amounts of air, and was 
encouraged to continue his use of hypnosis as needed. Hypnosis and possibly 
other noninvasive treatments should be used for R-CPD before employment of more 
invasive and costly treatments such as botulinum toxin administration.
