WNT-activated medulloblastoma is one of the 4 molecularly defined subgroups of 
medulloblastoma and is characterized by distinct molecular, biological, and 
clinical features. These tumors originate from progenitor cells in the lower 
rhombic lip, leading to a characteristic anatomical location: midline, often 
involving the fourth ventricle and dorsal brainstem. This distinct location can 
help differentiate WNT-activated medulloblastomas from other subtypes on MRI. 
Although imaging may suggest WNT-activated medulloblastoma, a tissue diagnosis 
is required. WNT-activated medulloblastoma exhibits several unique histologic 
features that aid in diagnosis, and nearly all cases harbor either somatic 
CTNNB1 mutations or germline APC mutations. Treatment of all medulloblastoma is 
multimodal and includes maximal safe resection, radiotherapy, and adjuvant 
therapy. However, perhaps the most notable feature of WNT-activated 
medulloblastoma is the excellent prognosis associated with these tumors under 
current therapeutic regimens. The vasculature of WNT-activated medulloblastoma 
is thought to contribute to these favorable outcomes, as it mimics peripheral 
vascular endothelium, functionally eliminating the blood-brain barrier and 
increasing tumor susceptibility to systemic therapies. However, this vascular 
feature poses some challenges during surgical resection, as WNT-activated 
medulloblastomas carry an increased risk of intratumoral hemorrhage. With 5-year 
progression-free and overall survival exceeding 90% for WNT-activated 
medulloblastoma, and given the significant morbidity and late effects of current 
treatments, several trials are evaluating de-escalation of both craniospinal 
radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Results of these trials are pending, but 
preliminary findings suggest that dose reductions can decrease long-term side 
effects while maintaining comparable progression-free and overall survival.
