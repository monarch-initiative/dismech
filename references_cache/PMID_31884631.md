Peroxisomal disorders are a group of inherited metabolic diseases, which can be 
incompatible with life in the postnatal period or allow survival into adulthood. 
Retinopathy is a recurrent feature in both the severely and mildly affected 
patients, which can be accompanied with other ophthalmological pathologies. 
Thanks to next-generation sequencing, patients originally identified with other 
inherited blinding diseases were reclassified as suffering from peroxisomal 
disorders. In addition, new peroxisomal gene defects or disease presentations 
exhibiting retinal degeneration were recently identified. The pathogenic 
mechanisms underlying retinopathy in peroxisomal disorders remain unresolved.
