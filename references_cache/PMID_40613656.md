ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vertebroplasty 
versus posterior pedicle screw fixation combined with vertebroplasty in treating 
stage III Kummell's disease without neurological deficits.MethodA systematic 
literature search was conducted across six databases. A meta-analysis of 
prospective and retrospective studies meeting the inclusion criteria was 
conducted using Review Manager 5.4.1.ResultsEight studies (one prospective, one 
randomized control trial, and six retrospective) involving 409 patients were 
included. Vertebroplasty demonstrated advantages over posterior pedicle 
screw + vertebroplasty in operative time (weighted mean difference: -83.22 min; 
95% confidence interval: -97.70 to -68.73; p < 0.05), blood loss (weighted mean 
difference: -158.65 mL; 95% confidence interval: -219.99 to -97.31; p < 0.05), 
and hospital stay (weighted mean difference: -5.64 days; 95% confidence 
interval: -7.36 to -3.92; p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in 
Cobb's angle (weighted mean difference: 1.28°; 95% confidence interval: -0.21 to 
2.78; p > 0.05), relative anterior vertebral height (weighted mean difference: 
2.98%; 95% confidence interval: -4.15 to 10.11; p > 0.05), cement leakage (13.2% 
vs. 8.5%; odds ratios: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-3.24; p > 0.05), or 
wound infection (0% vs. 4.88%; odds ratios: 0.28; 95% confidence interval: 
0.07-1.15; p > 0.05).ConclusionBoth vertebroplasty and posterior pedicle 
screw + vertebroplasty are effective for treating stage III Kummell's disease 
without neurological deficits. Vertebroplasty offers superior perioperative 
outcomes with reduced surgical trauma and hospital stay.PROSPERO registration
