BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acne affects not only adolescents but also adults, 
significantly impacting their physical and mental health. This study aims to 
investigate the prevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) of post-adolescent acne vulgaris among adults aged 25-49 years globally 
from the years 1990 to 2021.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected information on all individuals aged 
25-49 years with post-adolescent acne. Data from the Global Burden of Diseases 
(GBD) study (2021) for 204 countries and territories was analyzed. The study 
focused on prevalence, incidence, DALYs, and estimated annual percentage change 
for post-adolescent acne. Bayesian age-period-cohort models predicted incidence 
trends from 2022 to 2050.
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized prevalence rate of post-adolescent acne 
increased from 1990 to 2021, with females having a higher burden than males. 
Germany reported the highest age-standardized prevalence rate, age-standardized 
incidence rate, and age-standardized DALYs rate. High socio-demographic index 
(SDI) regions had the highest rates, while low-middle SDI regions showed the 
most substantial increase. The number of adults with post-adolescent acne is 
projected to increase until 2050.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-adolescent acne vulgaris remains prevalent and is increasing 
globally. Comprehensive and targeted interventions are urgently needed to 
mitigate its impact, as projections indicate a continued rise in incidence.
