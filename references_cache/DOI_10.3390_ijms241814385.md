## Content

Systemic sclerosis, commonly known as scleroderma, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by vascular abnormalities, autoimmunity, and multiorgan fibrosis. The exact etiology is not known but believed to be triggered by environmental agents in a genetically susceptible host. Vascular symptoms such as the Raynaud phenomenon often precede other fibrotic manifestations such as skin thickening indicating that vascular dysfunction is the primary event. Endothelial damage and activation occur early, possibly triggered by various infectious agents and autoantibodies. Endothelial dysfunction, along with defects in endothelial progenitor cells, leads to defective angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Endothelial to mesenchymal cell transformation is another seminal event during pathogenesis that progresses to tissue fibrosis. The goal of the review is to discuss the molecular aspect of the endothelial dysfunction that leads to the development of systemic sclerosis.
