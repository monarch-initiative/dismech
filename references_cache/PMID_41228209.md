FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a crucial regulator of normal 
hematopoiesis, with high expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. 
Beyond its role in stem cell survival and proliferation, FLT3 signaling is 
essential for immune regulation, particularly dendritic cell differentiation and 
NK cell expansion. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FLT3 mutations-most commonly 
internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) 
substitutions-are among the most frequent genetic alterations, driving 
constitutive activation of proliferative and antiapoptotic pathways and 
conferring adverse prognosis. The clinical development of FLT3 inhibitors has 
been a decades-long endeavor. Early multikinase agents established 
proof-of-concept but were hampered by off-target effects and incomplete 
efficacy. The subsequent generation of potent and selective inhibitors has 
transformed outcomes, culminating in FDA approvals of midostaurin, quizartinib, 
and gilteritinib. Together with allogeneic transplantation, these agents have 
reshaped the treatment paradigm for FLT3-mutant AML, converting a historically 
high-risk subset into one with realistic prospects for long-term survival. 
Despite these advances, challenges remain. Resistance emerges through 
cell-intrinsic mechanisms such as acquisition of secondary TKD or RAS pathway 
mutations, metabolic reprogramming, and antiapoptotic shifts, as well as 
cell-extrinsic mechanisms mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, 
including cytokine support, stromal CYP3A4 metabolism, and retinoid 
inactivation. These pathways sustain measurable residual disease (MRD), the key 
predictor of relapse. Rational combination strategies and MRD-directed 
approaches are therefore essential to fully realize the curative potential of 
FLT3 inhibition.
