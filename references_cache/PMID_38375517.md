BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This review aimed to compare the efficacy of acidifying 
agents and clotrimazole in the treatment of patients with otomycosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The databases, including Research Gate, Google Scholar, 
ScienceDirect, Embase, Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, and library databases of 
clinical trials were searched in this study. The keywords were "Fungal Ear 
Infection" and "Otitis External" for otomycosis, "Clotrimazole", Lotrimin", 
"Mycelex", "Desenex", and "Clotrimaderm Mycoderm" for clotrimazole, and "Boric 
Acid Alcohol", "Alcohol-vinegar solution", Burow solution (Domeboro), "Isopropyl 
Alcohol", "VoSol" and "Acetic Acid" for acidifying agents. Regarding search 
strategy, a total of 53 studies were collected, 11 of which were maintained for 
assessment. Almost all studies were published after 1990. These articles 
discussed the role of clotrimazole and acidifying compounds in the treatment of 
otomycosis. Moreover, the route of administration, dosage, and side effects of 
these medications were highlighted.
RESULTS: Eight studies had similar results and claimed that clotrimazole has the 
best or most significant effect on the treatment of otomycosis for patients 
suffering from pain, itching, swelling, and hearing loss.
CONCLUSION: Although all medications appear effective, there is a paucity of 
evidence to fully support the decision to choose between clotrimazole or 
acidifying agents for the treatment of otomycosis in terms of both efficacy and 
safety. However, in the biomedical field, the re-emerging investigation 
attention is due to the statements of a number of mechanisms defending the use 
of acidifying agents to treat mycosis (of antifungal-resistant species).
