Laryngeal rheumatoid arthritis.

Bridger MW, Jahn AF, van Nostrand AW.

The classic sequence of pathologic changes associated with rheumatoid arthritis 
as they affect the cricothyroid and cricoarytenoid joints of five larynges is 
described. Although several previous reports have drawn attention to the 
presence of rheumatoid arthritis in the larnx, the current study emphasizes that 
the small joints of the larynx may be involved by the full spectrum of 
pathologic changes and that both cricothyroid and cricoarytenoid joints are 
equally prone to the various stages of inflammation, joint destruction and 
ankylosis that characterize the disease elsewhere. Rheumatoid nodules were seen 
in two cases and granulomatous areas surrounding cricothyroid joints were noted 
in two others.
