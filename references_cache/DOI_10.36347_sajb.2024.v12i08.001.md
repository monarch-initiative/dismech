## Content

The word "otomycosis" refers to a specific type of fungal infection affecting the external auditory canal. It appears to be a highly prevalent clinical condition seen in otorhinolaryngology outpatient departments worldwide. Most Aspergillus and Candida species are the etiological microorganisms that form biofilm inside the ear canal. The development of otomycosis can be caused by improper self-cleaning, self-medication, and the insertion of needless instruments into the ear canal. Ear pain, discharge from the ears, and hearing loss are the main signs of otomycosis. Therefore, in order to take a percussive action during the primary stage of infection, the correct diagnosis is imperative. However, special medical attention is required, particularly in patients with low immunity, when infection spreads to a mastoid area with a suppurative condition. The purpose of this thorough review is to raise awareness of the importance of good health education and self-hygiene in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The majority of cases of otomycosis affect one ear, and immunocompromised patients are more likely to experience bilateral involvement. The most often mentioned risk factors include swimming, applying mustard oil to ears, overusing antibiotic ear drops, using Q-tips, wooden sticks, metal pickers, and self-cleaning of ears with these items. Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequently implicated bacterium in cases of concurrent otomycosis. In order to lower the incidence of otomycosis, this literature review emphasizes the necessity of education in order to eliminate the previously mentioned predisposing risk factors.
