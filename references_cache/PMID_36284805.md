Headache was the most common neurological symptom during the H1N1 pandemic in 
2009 and the most recrudescing symptom of human coronavirus (hCoV) in 2016. Even 
in this prevailing global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the main 
neurological symptom is found to be a headache. Headache phenotypes identified 
with COVID-19 are largely migraine, tension-type headache, or cough headache 
located in the frontotemporal or occipital region with wavering intensity and 
essentially of acute onset. We present two cases of unusual headache phenotypes 
with COVID-19 infection and attempt to shed light on their pathomechanism. 
Trigeminal autonomic cephalgia may be a possibility in our case, triggered by 
the virus itself, either directly or through an indirect path elaborated well in 
the pathomechanism segment. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARs-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located in the 
peripheral nerve and intracranial vascular endothelium, sensitizing the 
trigeminovascular system by further interacting with higher cortical pain 
centers via the thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, producing pain. CSF analysis 
along with opening pressure measurement in Case 2 may portray a comprehensive 
understanding of our patient's headache. Coupling with the dorsal pons and 
trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), the hypothalamus could be the supreme 
generator for an attack. Hypothalamic perturbance could be a possible phenomenon 
for abnormal headache experiences and requires further validation. The possible 
COVID-19 pain pathway pathomechanism engaging interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha aided with a cortical spreading depression 
disturbing the hypothalamus is also described in this study. Undoubtedly, this 
pandemic could prove to be a guiding tool for mankind, for a comprehensive 
understanding of the enigmatic concepts of headaches.
