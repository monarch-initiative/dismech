Type 1 diabetes is characterised by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic 
β-cells, leading to an absolute or near-absolute insulin deficiency. Although 
traditionally associated with childhood onset, it can manifest at any age, and 
it is increasingly recognised that there is significant heterogeneity in its 
clinical presentation. This review examines the intricate interplay between 
genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and autoimmune mechanisms that 
contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. The role of clinical 
phenotype, along with diagnostic and clinical measurements of autoantibodies and 
C-peptide, in the classification of type 1 diabetes is discussed, alongside the 
challenges in diagnosing and classifying the disease. Emerging insights from 
studies into the heterogeneity of type 1 diabetes phenotypes and mechanistic 
endotypes underscore the need for refined diagnostic criteria, particularly in 
identifying autoimmunity in individuals initially diagnosed with type 2 
diabetes. The impact of obesity and insulin resistance on disease progression 
and clinical management is also examined. Overall, this review aims to provide a 
comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of type 1 diabetes, 
highlighting critical areas for future research and potential therapeutic 
approaches tailored to individual patient profiles. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Type 
1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body does not produce insulin, 
leading to high blood sugar levels. Traditionally thought to start in children 
and young adults, type 1 diabetes can occur at any age. However, many factors 
contribute to when someone develops type 1 diabetes and how rapidly the disease 
progresses, including a person's combination of genetic factors, including 
specific genes that can either be protective or high-risk for the development of 
type 1 diabetes. Although it is widely assumed that a triggering event or events 
initiate the autoimmune process, the trigger or triggers remain unknown. 
However, it is this autoimmune process that causes progressive destruction of 
insulin-producing Β-cells in the pancreas that eventually leads to high blood 
sugar and the diagnosis of diabetes. Although we have several tools to diagnose 
and classify diabetes, including measuring autoimmune markers (antibodies) in 
the blood, there is significant variation in how individuals with type 1 
diabetes can present, which can make recognizing and appropriately treating type 
1 diabetes more challenging. Finding better ways to characterize the unique 
characteristics of each subgroup of individuals may provide new insights into 
how we can best tailor treatment to each of these patient groups.
