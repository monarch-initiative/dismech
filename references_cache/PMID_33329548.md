Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disease targeting synovial 
joints. Traditionally, RA is divided into seropositive (SP) and seronegative 
(SN) disease forms, the latter consisting of an array of unrelated diseases with 
joint involvement. Recently, we described a severe form of SN-RA that associates 
with characteristic joint destruction. Here, we sought biological 
characteristics to differentiate this rare but aggressive anti-citrullinated 
peptide antibody-negative destructive RA (CND-RA) from early seropositive 
(SP-RA) and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (SN-RA). We also aimed to study 
cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes in autoimmune arthritis. CND-RA, SP-RA and SN-RA were 
compared to healthy controls to reveal differences in T-cell receptor beta 
(TCRβ) repertoire, cytokine levels and autoantibody repertoires. Whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) was 
performed to study somatic mutations in a clonally expanded CD8+ lymphocyte 
population in an index patient. A unique TCRβ signature was detected in CND-RA 
patients. In addition, CND-RA patients expressed higher levels of the bone 
destruction-associated TNFSF14 cytokine. Blood IgG repertoire from CND-RA 
patients recognized fewer endogenous proteins than SP-RA patients' repertoires. 
Using WES, we detected a stable mutation profile in the clonally expanded CD8+ 
T-cell population characterized by cytotoxic gene expression signature 
discovered by sc-RNA-sequencing. Our results identify CND-RA as an independent 
RA subset and reveal a CND-RA specific TCR signature in the CD8+ lymphocytes. 
Improved classification of seronegative RA patients underlines the heterogeneity 
of RA and also, facilitates development of improved therapeutic options for the 
treatment resistant patients.
