Climate change has a widespread impact on health across the continuum, 
influencing skin disease patterns, access to dermatologic care, and the burden 
of climate-sensitive conditions. Environmental changes driven by climate change 
impact the skin's ability to maintain homeostasis, contributing to the onset and 
exacerbation of various dermatologic diseases. Psoriasis, acne vulgaris, atopic 
dermatitis, photoaging, melasma, and skin cancers have been associated with 
repeated exposure to rising levels of pollutants. Furthermore, the depletion of 
the stratospheric ozone layer has contributed to an elevated risk of developing 
skin cancer-including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell 
carcinoma-due to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Notably, while 
melanoma is linked to intense, intermittent UV exposure and sunburns, basal cell 
and squamous cell carcinomas are more strongly associated with cumulative or 
chronic sun exposure over a lifetime. According to the World Health 
Organization, air pollution contributes to more than 700,000 premature deaths 
each year, and a 1% decrease in ozone thickness corresponds with a 2% rise in 
melanoma incidence. This review also identifies research gaps, such as limited 
longitudinal studies, underrepresentation of pediatric and elderly populations, 
and limited exploration of nitrosative stress mechanisms. Due to these factors, 
practitioners should be aware of both the current and projected impacts of 
climate change in their regions to effectively identify and manage associated 
conditions and exacerbations.
