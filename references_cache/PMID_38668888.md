The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has introduced the 
medical community to the phenomenon of long COVID, a condition characterized by 
persistent symptoms following the resolution of the acute phase of infection. 
Among the myriad of symptoms reported by long COVID sufferers, chronic fatigue, 
cognitive disturbances, and exercise intolerance are predominant, suggesting 
systemic alterations beyond the initial viral pathology. Emerging evidence has 
pointed to mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential underpinning mechanism 
contributing to the persistence and diversity of long COVID symptoms. This 
review aims to synthesize current findings related to mitochondrial dysfunction 
in long COVID, exploring its implications for cellular energy deficits, 
oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, metabolic disturbances, and endothelial 
dysfunction. Through a comprehensive analysis of the literature, we highlight 
the significance of mitochondrial health in the pathophysiology of long COVID, 
drawing parallels with similar clinical syndromes linked to post-infectious 
states in other diseases where mitochondrial impairment has been implicated. We 
discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial function, 
including pharmacological interventions, lifestyle modifications, exercise, and 
dietary approaches, and emphasize the need for further research and 
collaborative efforts to advance our understanding and management of long COVID. 
This review underscores the critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in long 
COVID and calls for a multidisciplinary approach to address the gaps in our 
knowledge and treatment options for those affected by this condition.
