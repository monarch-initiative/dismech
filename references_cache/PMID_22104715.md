Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by ocular and 
dental abnormalities. This case demonstrates a comprehensive review of the 
syndrome's clinical and dental features and describes a case of a 13-year-old 
boy presenting with it. The patient showed severe hypodontia, microdontia, and 
short roots. Different treatment options are discussed. Early diagnosis and an 
interdisciplinary approach are necessary to provide the best short- and 
long-term treatment plans, as well as treatment and follow-up for individuals 
with the syndrome.
