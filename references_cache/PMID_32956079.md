Temple-Baraitser syndrome (TMBTS; OMIM: 611816) is a rare developmental disorder 
characterized by severe mental retardation and anomalies of thumb and great toe 
with absence/hypoplasia of the nails. Here, we report an additional patient with 
TMBTS, review clinical and radiological features of previously reported cases 
and discuss mode of inheritance. The patient exhibited a pattern of anomalies: 
mild dysmorphic facial features with a wide open mouth, a thick vermilion border 
of the upper lip and downturned corners of the mouth; nails were absent on both 
great toes and thumb. Electroencephalogram showed a diffusely slow background. 
Whole genome sequencing identified one pathogenic missense mutation in KCNH1 (c. 
1529 A > C; Asn510Thr) in this TMBTS patient. The mutation was also validated by 
Sanger sequencing.
