BACKGROUND: Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type I (MOPD I, 
also known as Taybi-Linder syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder associated with 
severe intrauterine growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, brain 
anomalies, stunted limbs, and early mortality. RNU4ATAC, the gene responsible 
for this disorder, does not encode a protein but instead the U4atac small 
nuclear RNA (snRNA), a crucial component of the minor spliceosome. Roifman 
syndrome is an allelic disorder of MOPD I that is characterized by 
immunodeficiency complications.
CASE REPORT: The patient described herein is an 18-year-old woman exhibiting 
congenital dwarfism and microcephaly with structural brain anomaly. She suffered 
human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6)-associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy at the 
age of one, thereafter resulting in severe psychomotor disabilities. Genetic 
analysis using gene microarray and whole-exome sequencing could not identify the 
cause of her congenital anomalies. However, Sanger sequencing revealed a 
compound heterozygous mutation within RNU4ATAC 
(NR_023343.1:n.[50G > A];[55G > A]). Immunological findings showed decreases in 
total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and T cell regenerative activity. Furthermore, 
antibodies against varicella-zoster, rubella, measles, mumps, and influenza were 
very low or negative despite having received vaccinations for these viruses. 
HHV-6 IgG antibodies were also undetected.
DISCUSSION: The patient here exhibited a marked MOPD I phenotype complicated by 
various immunodeficiencies. Previous studies have not demonstrated 
immunodeficiency comorbidities within MOPD I subjects, but this report suggests 
an evident immunodeficiency in MOPD I. Patients with MOPD I should be treated 
with one of the immunodeficiency syndromes.
