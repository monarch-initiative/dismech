Vitiligo is an acquired dermatological disease frequently associated with 
autoimmune thyroid disorders. Several theories have been proposed so far to 
unravel the complex vitiligo pathogenesis. Currently, the autocytotoxic and the 
autoimmune theories are the most accredited hypothesis, since they are sustained 
by several important clinical and experimental evidences. A growing body of 
evidences shows that autoimmunity and oxidative stress strictly interact to 
finally determine melanocyte loss. In this scenario, associated thyroid 
autoimmunity might play an active and important role in triggering and 
maintaining the depigmentation process of vitiligo.
