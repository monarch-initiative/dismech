BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is a highly infectious disease that is spread from 
person to person by infected aerosols emitted by patients with respiratory forms 
of the disease. We describe a novel device that utilizes immunosensor and 
bio-optical technology to detect M. tuberculosis antigen (Ag85B) in cough and 
demonstrate its use under field conditions during a pilot study in an area of 
high TB incidence.
METHODS: The TB Breathalyzer device (Rapid Biosensor Systems Ltd) was field 
tested in the outpatient clinic of Adama Hospital, Ethiopia. Adults seeking 
diagnosis for respiratory complaints were tested. Following nebulization with 
0.9% saline patients were asked to cough into a disposable collection device 
where cough aerosols were deposited. Devices were then inserted into a portable 
instrument to assess whether antigen was present in the sample. Demographic and 
clinical data were recorded and all patients were subjected to chest radiogram 
and examination of sputum by Ziehl-Nielsen microscopy. In the absence of culture 
treatment decisions were based on smear microscopy, chest x-ray and clinical 
assessment. Breathalyzer testing was undertaken by a separate physician to 
triage and diagnostic assessment.
RESULTS: Sixty individuals were each subjected to a breathalyzer test. The 
procedure was well tolerated and for each patient the testing was completed in 
less than 10 min. Positive breath test results were recorded for 29 (48%) 
patients. Of 31 patients with a diagnosis of tuberculosis 23 (74%; 95% CI 55-87) 
were found positive for antigen in their breath and 20 (64%; 95% CI 45-80) were 
smear positive for acid fast bacilli in their sputum. Six patients provided 
apparent false positive breathalyzer results that did not correlate with a 
diagnosis of tuberculosis.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the breathalyzer device described warrants further 
investigation as a tool for studying exhalation of M. tuberculosis. The 
portability, simplicity of use and speed of the test device suggest it may also 
find use as a tool to aid early identification of infectious cases. We recommend 
studies be undertaken to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 
the device when compared to microbiological and clinical indicators of 
tuberculosis disease.
