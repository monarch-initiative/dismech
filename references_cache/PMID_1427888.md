Construction of dense genetic linkage maps is hampered, in practice, by the 
occurrence of laboratory typing errors. Even relatively low error rates cause 
substantial map expansion and interfere with the determination of correct 
genetic order. Here, we describe a systematic method for overcoming these 
difficulties, based on incorporating the possibility of error into the usual 
likelihood model for linkage analysis. Using this approach, it is possible to 
construct genetic maps allowing for error and to identify the typings most 
likely to be in error. The method has been implemented for F2 intercrosses 
between two inbred strains, a situation relevant to the construction of genetic 
maps in experimental organisms. Tests involving both simulated and real data are 
presented, showing that the method detects the vast majority of errors.
