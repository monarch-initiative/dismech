Results of conventional or high-dose chemotherapy for peripheral T-cell lymphoma 
(PTCL) are unsatisfactory, leaving a potential role for autologous or allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation. There are a number of retrospective studies and a few 
prospective studies on autologous transplantation for first-line PTCL treatment. 
Studies show that autologous transplant is feasible in relapsed and previously 
untreated patients, and efficacy is comparable to results in aggressive B-cell 
lymphomas. Allogeneic transplant may also have a role in relapsed PTCL, 
especially in the context of reduced-intensity conditioning, which has decreased 
nonrelapse mortality. However, it is unclear whether there is a role for 
allogeneic transplant as a frontline treatment option.
