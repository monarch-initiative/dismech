Hearing aid users with longstanding and severe dermatitis in the ear canal were 
examined by a dermatologist and patch tested. In 6 of 22 (27%) patients, contact 
allergy to the earmold material was found. Four of the six had a positive test 
reaction to methyl methacrylate and two also to triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate 
and urethane dimethacrylate. Positive patch test reactions to substances used 
for topical treatment were found as well. Routines including liberal patch 
testing for this group of patients are suggested.
