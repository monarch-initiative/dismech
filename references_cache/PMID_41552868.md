AIM: Given the chronic nature of acne, two 6-month studies were conducted to 
evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of clindamycin phosphate 
1.2%/adapalene 0.15%/benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 3.1% gel (CAB)-the only approved 
triple-combination acne topical-and its effects on scarring/dyspigmentation in 
participants with moderate to severe acne.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were pooled from 2 identical, open-label, 
single-center studies conducted in participants (N = 50) aged ≥12 years with 
Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3/4. Endpoints included change 
from baseline in IGA score, inflammatory/noninflammatory lesions, skin 
appearance (dryness, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation [PIH], postinflammatory 
erythema [PIE]), and scarring. Adverse events and tolerability (itching, 
burning, redness, swelling) were assessed.
RESULTS: At week 24, 67% of participants achieved treatment success, and 
significant reductions from baseline in inflammatory (88%) and noninflammatory 
(68%) lesions were observed (p < 0.001, both). Significant reductions in 
scarring (33%), investigator- and participant-assessed PIH (71%; 78%, 
respectively), and PIE (77%; 77%, respectively) were demonstrated (p < 0.001, 
all). Most participants (>70%) reported no tolerability issues throughout the 
studies. Seven adverse events occurred; 4 were related to CAB, and 3 led to 
study discontinuation (BPO allergy [n = 2], irritant contact dermatitis to BPO 
[n = 1]).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CAB is an appropriate and effective 
topical option for the long-term treatment of acne vulgaris.
