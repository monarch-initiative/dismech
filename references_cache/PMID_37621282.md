OBJECTIVE: To expand our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms 
underlying vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis by identifying any difference 
in the vestibulo-ocular reflex for each semicircular canal.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.
SETTING: The Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Chosun 
University Hospital, from January 2015 to December 2021.
METHODS: We included 23 vestibular neuritis and 27 labyrinthitis patients who 
had been hospitalized. Pure-tone audiometry, a bithermal caloric test, and a 
video head-impulse test were performed within 5 days of symptom onset.
RESULTS: In the vestibular neuritis group, mean vestibulo-ocular reflex gains 
were decreased to 0.51 in the ipsilesional horizontal canal and 0.55 in anterior 
canal, leading to marked asymmetry, whereas the gain of the ipsilesional 
posterior canal was relatively preserved at 0.85. In the labyrinthitis group, 
the mean vestibulo-ocular reflex gain was 0.72 in the ipsilesional horizontal 
canal, 0.73 in the ipsilesional anterior canal, and 0.55 in the ipsilesional 
posterior canal. We observed statistical differences in the vestibulo-ocular 
reflex gain and incidence of corrective saccades on the ipsilesional side in 
three semicircular canals between the groups (p = .002 for horizontal canal, 
p = .003 for anterior canal, and p < .001 for posterior canal). The receiver 
operating characteristic curve showed that pure-tone audiometry, ipsilesional 
posterior canal gain, and gain asymmetry of posterior canal were excellent 
parameters for distinguishing labyrinthitis from vestibular neuritis.
CONCLUSION: Vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis patients have different 
degrees and patterns of video head-impulse test involvement in the three 
semicircular canals, suggesting that the two distinct disorders may have 
different etiologies.
