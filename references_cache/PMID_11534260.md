The mechanisms of thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are highly 
heterogeneous and multifactorial, and some genetic factors may be involved in 
its pathophysiology. The genetic variants of representative antigen, beta 
2-glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI), have been known, and valine/leucine247 
polymorphism is a genetic risk for having anti beta 2GPI antibodies and APS. 
Congenital beta 2GPI deficiency did not correlate with thrombophilia, thus its 
responsible gene (beta 2GPI-Sapporo) was not a risk for thrombosis. Many other 
thrombosis-related genetic factors have been investigated in APS, but no 
additional risk for thrombosis has been indicated in patients with 
antiphospholipid antibodies.
