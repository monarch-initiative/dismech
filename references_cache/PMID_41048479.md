INTRODUCTION: In patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), repeated laparotomy 
and bowel resection can lead to short bowel syndrome and adhesions. Minimizing 
surgical invasiveness while effectively managing intussusception caused by 
polyps is therefore essential. We present a pediatric case of recurrent 
intussusception due to a jejunal polyp near the ligament of Treitz, successfully 
treated with a hybrid approach combining laparoscopic reduction and 
double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE)-assisted polypectomy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-year-old girl presented with small bowel intussusception 
and underwent laparoscopic-assisted resection of a 40-cm jejunal segment 
containing a 35-mm polyp and multiple adjacent polyps. Postoperative findings 
led to a diagnosis of PJS. Two weeks later, she developed recurrent 
intussusception. CT revealed a lead-point mass without signs of ischemia or 
strangulation. At reoperation, laparoscopic reduction was achieved except for 
residual intussusception near the ligament of Treitz. Under continuous 
laparoscopic observation, DBE identified a 40-mm polyp 30-40 cm distal to the 
pylorus. En bloc removal was not feasible; therefore, piecemeal resection was 
performed, resulting in complete release of the intussusception. Follow-up 
capsule endoscopy at 2 months confirmed no residual lesion.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the feasibility and safety of a hybrid 
laparoscopic-endoscopic approach for intussusception caused by proximal small 
bowel polyps in PJS, allowing bowel preservation and effective lesion removal. 
This strategy may serve as a valuable treatment option in selected cases.
