Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is caused by a deletion of a segment on the short arm 
(p) of chromosome 4. The major features of this disorder include a 
characteristic facial appearance known as the "Greek helmet," delayed growth and 
development; prenatally and postnatally, intellectual disabilities, and 
seizures. To provide comprehensive and appropriate nursing and medical care to 
infants with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, it is imperative to know and understand 
the disorder. A case study of a 36 weeks' gestational age white-Hispanic male 
infant with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is presented with the purpose of increasing 
clinical knowledge and the implications for the clinical nurse and neonatal 
nurse practitioner.
