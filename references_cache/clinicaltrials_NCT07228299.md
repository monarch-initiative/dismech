# Supporting Families in the ICU: The Chaplain Family Project Multicenter RCT

## Content

The overarching goal of our work is to test the effect of high-quality spiritual care for ICU family surrogates on outcomes of psychological and spiritual well-being and medical decision making. Our team has developed an approach to high quality spiritual care intervention for ICU surrogates, called the Spiritual Care Assessment and Intervention (SCAI) framework, which is delivered by a chaplain interventionist to ICU surrogates.
