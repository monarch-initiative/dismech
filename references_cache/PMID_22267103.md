Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is produced in the liver and peripheral 
tissues including the growth plate, in response to growth hormone (GH) and is 
commonly used as a diagnostic marker of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and to 
monitor GH replacement therapy, as recommended by an international GH 
consensus.1 However, while it is a useful biochemical tool, there are 
limitations to its use and results should be interpreted with care.
