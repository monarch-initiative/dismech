Two views of catatonia influence clinical practice. In the classical European 
view, adopted by DSM classifications, the signs of catatonia indicate a form of 
schizophrenia. In the syndromal view, the signs of catatonia are motor signs 
that are readily identified in many psychiatric disorders. Catatonia is a 
parallel behavior phenomenon to delusions (in thought) and delirium (in 
cognition). The syndromic view includes the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. It 
encourages a different treatment algorithm, the use of benzodiazepines and 
electroconvulsive therapy, to replace the customary use of antipsychotic drugs 
alone. The benefits of such treatment warrant the recommended change in concept 
and classification.
