Cholera is an acute form of diarrhoeal disease that plagued human civilization 
over the centuries. The sudden and explosive onset of the disease in the form of 
an outbreak or epidemic, coupled with high mortality and morbidity rates, had a 
tragic impact on the personal as well as social life of people living in the 
affected areas. The enormity of human sufferings led clinicians and scientists 
to carry out extensive research on cholera and Vibrio cholerae (the causative 
bacterium of the disease) leading to major discoveries that opened up novel 
areas of research or new disciplines in biomedical sciences. An attempt is made 
here to summarize some of these breakthroughs and outline their significance in 
broader perspectives. Finally, the possible impact of the global socio-political 
scenario on the spread of cholera epidemics (pandemicity of cholera) is briefly 
discussed.
