PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the absence of 
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, remains clinically challenging due to the 
lack of effective targeted therapies. This investigation revealed the anti-TNBC 
potential of Trichoderma viride ethyl acetate extract (TVEAE) from the 
endophytic fungus Trichoderma viride isolated from Coreopsis basalis.
METHODS: Pharmacological validation of TVEAE's anti-TNBC efficacy was conducted 
through in vitro and in vivo pharmacological models. The cell death mechanisms 
were systematically investigated using Hoechst staining, reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) detection, and lipid peroxidation assays. Potential therapeutic targets 
and signaling pathways were identified by integrating network pharmacology, 
transcriptomics, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). 
Furthermore, this study validated key tumor-related proteins involved in tumor 
progression and cell death pathways via Western blotting. Finally, chemical 
constituents were characterized through molecular network coupled with Global 
Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) analysis.
RESULTS: Both in vitro and in vivo models established TVEAE's significant 
anti-TNBC efficacy. Mechanistic interrogation established TVEAE-mediated 
ferroptosis induction via selective modulation of leukocyte transendothelial 
migration (TEM) signaling cascades. Integrative analysis combining 
transcriptomics, WGCNA, and network pharmacology identified IL-6/TNF-α/HSP90AA1 
as core therapeutic targets regulating TEM pathway dynamics. GNPS-assisted 
molecular networking uncovered six structurally novel anti-TNBC metabolites, 
including N-lauryldiethanolamine, erucamide, and Gliotoxin.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of TVEAE's anti-TNBC activity 
through multi-target engagement along the leukocyte TEM signaling axis, 
effectively triggering ferroptosis. The mechanistic elucidation advances TNBC 
therapeutic development, offering a multi-dimensional targeting strategy against 
this recalcitrant malignancy.
