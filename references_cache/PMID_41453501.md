BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy for Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria is threatened by the emergence of partial resistance.
METHODS: Molecular characterization of antimalarial resistance-associated genes 
Pfk13, Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr, Pfdhps and PfCytB was performed on blood samples 
collected from two patients with recurrent episodes of P. falciparum malaria.
RESULTS: Two severe P. falciparum malaria in Italian travelers from sub-Saharan 
Africa showed recrudescence after standard treatment with intravenous artesunate 
and oral dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. In one case, the validated marker R561H 
of artemisinin partial resistance was identified. In the second patient, no 
Pfkelch13 mutations were detected, and the recrudescent episode was probably the 
consequence of low blood drug concentration administered by nasogastric tube, 
although the possible role of Pfkelch13-independent pathways or reduced 
artemisinin susceptibility cannot be ruled out.
CONCLUSION: The first imported case of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum in 
Italy from sub-Saharan Africa underscores the need for continuous surveillance 
and eventually adapting treatment protocols.
