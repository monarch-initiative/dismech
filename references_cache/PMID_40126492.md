IMPORTANCE: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is 
characterized by progressive development of kidney cysts and is the most common 
inherited kidney disorder worldwide. ADPKD accounts for 5% to 10% of kidney 
failure in the US and Europe, and its prevalence in the US is 9.3 per 10 000 
individuals.
OBSERVATIONS: ADPKD is typically diagnosed in individuals aged 27 to 42 years 
and is primarily caused by pathogenic variants in the PKD1 (78%) or PKD2 (15%) 
genes. Most persons with ADPKD have an affected parent, but de novo disease is 
suggested in 10% to 25% of families. More than 90% of patients older than 35 
years have hepatic cysts, which may cause abdominal discomfort and occasionally 
require medical or surgical intervention. Hypertension affects 70% to 80% of 
patients with ADPKD, and approximately 9% to 14% develop intracranial aneurysms, 
which have a rupture rate of 0.57 per 1000 patient-years. Approximately 50% of 
individuals with ADPKD require kidney replacement therapy by 62 years of age. 
The severity of kidney disease can be quantified using the Mayo Imaging 
Classification (MIC), which stratifies patients based on total kidney volume 
adjusted for height and age and ranges from 1A to 1E. Patients with MIC 1C to 
MIC 1E have larger kidneys because of more rapid growth (6%-10% per year) 
compared with those with MIC 1A and 1B (1%-5% per year) and have earlier 
progression to kidney replacement therapy, which occurs at a mean age of 58.4 
years for MIC 1C, 52.5 years for MIC 1D, and 43.4 years for MIC 1E. Optimal 
management of ADPKD includes systolic blood pressure lower than 120 mm Hg for 
most patients, but lower than 110/75 mm Hg for patients with MIC 1C to 1E who 
have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 
m2 and are younger than 50 years, dietary sodium restriction (<2000 mg/d), 
weight management, and adequate hydration (>2.5 L daily). The vasopressin type 2 
receptor antagonist tolvaptan reduces the annual rate of eGFR decline by 0.98 to 
1.27 mL/min/1.73 m2 and is indicated for patients with MIC 1C to 1E or an eGFR 
decline greater than 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year to slow disease progression and 
delay the onset of kidney failure.
CONCLUSION: ADPKD is the most common genetic kidney disease worldwide and is 
characterized by progressive development of kidney cysts. Patients typically 
have hypertension and liver cysts, and 9% to 14% develop intracranial aneurysms. 
First-line treatment includes blood pressure control, dietary and weight 
management, and adequate hydration. Tolvaptan reduces the rate of eGFR decline 
for those at high risk of rapid progression to kidney failure.
