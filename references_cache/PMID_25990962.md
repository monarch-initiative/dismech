Differences in the seroprevalence and unique pattern of parvovirus B19 (B19V) 
acute infections have been documented around the world. This study was conducted 
to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-parvovirus B19V IgG antibodies in the 
Israeli population and to assess the pattern of acute infection based on data 
from two laboratories in Israel. The overall IgG prevalence in the 1008 
representative sera samples was 61·4% and the age-adjusted prevalence rate was 
58·2%. Seropositivity was significantly associated with age, ranging from 25·7% 
in children aged 20 years. While no significant differences in seropositivity 
were detected between sexes and population groups, significantly lower 
seroprevalence was observed in older Jews born in Africa or Asia. Acute 
infection rates of 4·1% (234 cases) were found based on the positive IgM results 
identified in samples from 5663 individuals collected between 2008 and 2013. 
Annual peaks of infection were observed in 2008 and 2011-2012 and major seasonal 
peak of B19V IgM positivity was identified in June each year. The number of 
requests for B19V serology was significantly higher for women aged 20-39 years 
while the majority IgM-positive cases were identified in young children. With 
more than 30% of the adult population being susceptible to B19V infection, 
monitoring B19V status should be considered in specific risk groups such as 
pregnant women.
