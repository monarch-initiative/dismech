Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a rare multi-system disorder associated with cardiac 
anomalies. All patients with a diagnosis of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome were 
identified from our electronic medical record. Chart review was performed to 
document the presence and types of CHD. Out of 58 patients, 14 (24.1%) had CHD 
and a wide variety of cardiac lesions were identified.
