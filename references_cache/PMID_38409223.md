Generative pretrained models have achieved remarkable success in various domains 
such as language and computer vision. Specifically, the combination of 
large-scale diverse datasets and pretrained transformers has emerged as a 
promising approach for developing foundation models. Drawing parallels between 
language and cellular biology (in which texts comprise words; similarly, cells 
are defined by genes), our study probes the applicability of foundation models 
to advance cellular biology and genetic research. Using burgeoning single-cell 
sequencing data, we have constructed a foundation model for single-cell biology, 
scGPT, based on a generative pretrained transformer across a repository of over 
33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT effectively distills 
critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through further 
adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior 
performance across diverse downstream applications. This includes tasks such as 
cell type annotation, multi-batch integration, multi-omic integration, 
perturbation response prediction and gene network inference.
