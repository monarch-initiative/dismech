# Classification and Functional Stratification of the Patients With Ciliopathy and Identification of Biomarkers to Improve Their Prognosis

## Content

The purpose of the C'IL-LICO RICM study is to develop innovative and transformative diagnostic and prognostic for patients suffering from ciliopathies leading to renal failure.

The objectives is to decipher disease mechanisms and highlight signaling pathways altered in at-risk to develop renal failure patient groups and to produce a prognostic biomarker-based kit to predict the evolution of ciliopathy patients towards renal impairment.
