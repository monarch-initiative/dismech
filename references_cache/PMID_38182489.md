α-Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by decreased 
synthesis of α-globin chains that results in an imbalance of α and β globin and 
thus varying degrees of ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased red blood cell 
(RBC) survival, chronic hemolytic anemia, and subsequent comorbidities. Clinical 
presentation varies depending on the genotype, ranging from a silent or mild 
carrier state to severe, transfusion-dependent or lethal disease. Management of 
patients with α-thalassemia is primarily supportive, addressing either symptoms 
(eg, RBC transfusions for anemia), complications of the disease, or its 
transfusion-dependence (eg, chelation therapy for iron overload). Several novel 
therapies are also in development, including curative gene manipulation 
techniques and disease modifying agents that target ineffective erythropoiesis 
and chronic hemolytic anemia. This review of α-thalassemia and its various 
manifestations provides practical information for clinicians who practice beyond 
those regions where it is found with high frequency.
