Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disease that affects the skeletal system 
among other organ systems. Kyphoscoliosis, spondylolisthesis, and atlantoaxial 
subluxation are common spinal deformities in Marfan syndrome, and distinctive 
vertebral morphology within such patients presents significant treatment 
challenges. Although most scoliosis curves in patients who have Marfan syndrome 
are minor, those that require treatment progress rapidly; brace treatment has 
proven ineffective for most patients. Surgical correction is associated with 
complications, such as failure of fixation and additional deformity; however 
good results are possible when consideration is given to the unique challenges 
presented by patients who have Marfan syndrome.
