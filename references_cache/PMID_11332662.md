BACKGROUND: The optimal control of communicable diseases requires accurate 
information on incubation periods, periods of infectiousness and the 
effectiveness of exclusion. We collected the available evidence for a wide range 
of infections and infestations and produced evidence-based guidelines for their 
control in schools and preschools.
METHODS: A thorough MEDLINE literature search was conducted on the incubation 
period, period of infectiousness and effectiveness of exclusion for 41 
infections. The quality of the information obtained was indicated by levels of 
evidence. The information was used to produce guidelines on exclusion, and the 
recommendations were graded according to the levels of evidence available. 
Grades A, B and C represented strongly, reasonably and poorly evidence-based 
recommendations, respectively.
RESULTS: The quality of data obtained was highly variable. Information on 
incubation periods was obtained for all 41 infections and was generally of good 
quality. Information on periods of infectiousness and effectiveness of exclusion 
was of a lesser quality and was found for only 11 and 4 conditions, 
respectively. There were 3 Grade A, 17 Grade B and 21 Grade C recommendations on 
exclusion. Examples of exclusion periods include: 5 days for chickenpox, 
measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis and scarlet fever; and 24 h from the 
cessation of diarrhea for most gastrointestinal diseases In contrast to existing 
guidelines exclusion was not recommended for school age children with hepatitis 
A.
CONCLUSIONS: We have been able to present the best available data on the 
incubation periods and periods of infectiousness of 41 childhood infections. It 
was possible to produce strongly or reasonably evidence-based guidelines on 
exclusion periods for approximately one-half of the infections.
