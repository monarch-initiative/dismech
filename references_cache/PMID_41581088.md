Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) refers to a constellation of chronic 
symptoms and deficits experienced by both adult and paediatric survivors of 
critical illness. These may include impairment in physical, cognitive and mental 
domains several months after admission to the intensive care unit. Affected 
patients may experience chronic pain, sleep disturbances and swallowing 
dysfunction, which may impact their quality of life. Beyond the medical 
consequences, PICS poses psychological and financial challenges to both patients 
and their caregivers. This state-of-the-art review provides a comprehensive 
overview of current evidence on PICS, including key risk factors, screening 
instruments and potential treatment strategies. Future efforts should prioritise 
standardised data collection, family-centred care and restoration of 
health-related quality of life.
