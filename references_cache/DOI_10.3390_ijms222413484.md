## Content

Mitochondrial functional integrity depends on protein and lipid homeostasis in the mitochondrial membranes and disturbances in their accumulation can cause disease. AGK, a mitochondrial acylglycerol kinase, is not only involved in lipid signaling but is also a component of the TIM22 complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which mediates the import of a subset of membrane proteins. AGK mutations can alter both phospholipid metabolism and mitochondrial protein biogenesis, contributing to the pathogenesis of Sengers syndrome. We describe the case of an infant carrying a novel homozygous AGK variant, c.518+1G>A, who was born with congenital cataracts, pielic ectasia, critical congenital dilated myocardiopathy, and hyperlactacidemia and died 20 h after birth. Using the patient’s DNA, we performed targeted sequencing of 314 nuclear genes encoding respiratory chain complex subunits and proteins implicated in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). A decrease of 96-bp in the length of the AGK cDNA sequence was detected. Decreases in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the OCR:ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) ratio in the patient’s fibroblasts indicated reduced electron flow through the respiratory chain, and spectrophotometry revealed decreased activity of OXPHOS complexes I and V. We demonstrate a clear defect in mitochondrial function in the patient’s fibroblasts and describe the possible molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenicity of this novel AGK variant. Experimental validation using in vitro analysis allowed an accurate characterization of the disease-causing variant.
