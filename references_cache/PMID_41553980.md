HTLV-1 is a retrovirus associated with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and 
inflammatory diseases, including HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) and 
HTLV-1-associated bronchopneumonopathy (HAB). Although pulmonary complications 
are common in HTLV-1-associated diseases, the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. We compared HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and chemokine receptor 
expression in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from asymptomatic carriers (ACs) and patients with 
HAB, HAM, or ATL. T cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the 
expression of CXCR3 and CXCL10 in lung tissue was assessed by 
immunohistochemistry. HTLV-1 proviral DNA was detectable in BAL cells not only 
from HAB and ATL cases with pulmonary involvement, but also from some ACs and 
HAM cases without clinical respiratory symptoms, suggesting subclinical 
pulmonary infiltration. BAL samples from HAB and ATL showed increased CD8 + T 
cell frequency. Both CD4+ and CD8 + T cells in BAL expressed higher CXCR3 than 
their PBMC counterparts, whereas CCR4 and CXCR5 were not elevated. 
CADM1 + CD4 + T cells in BAL also exhibited higher CXCR3 than in PBMCs, and 
CXCR3+ frequencies were similar between CADM1+ and CADM1- CD4 + T cells within 
BAL, indicating that enhanced CXCR3 expression was largely independent of 
infection status. Histology revealed CD3+ mononuclear cell infiltration in 
alveolar septa and peribronchiolar regions in HAB and HAM, consistent with T 
cell-mediated alveolitis and bronchiolitis, and CXCL10 expression was elevated 
in infiltrated lesions. Collectively, these findings implicate the CXCR3/CXCL10 
axis as a common pathway for pulmonary T cell recruitment in HTLV-1-associated 
diseases.
