Craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia and foot abnormalities: an autosomal
dominant phenotype in a large Amish kindred.

Jackson CE, Weiss L, Reynolds WA, Forman TF, Peterson JA.

An unusual spectrum of craniofacial and foot abnormalities has been detected
within a large midwestern Amish kindred. Enlarged great toes and craniofacial
abnormalities suggested Pfeiffer acrocephalosynadactyly type V; however, thumb
abnormalities were not present. Eighty-eight affected individuals were observed
and another 50 were reliably reported to be affected. An autosomal dominant
inheritance pattern was observed associated with variable expressivity. All
affected individuals had some clinical or radiologic abnormality of the feet.
