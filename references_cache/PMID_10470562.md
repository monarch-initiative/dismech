A comprehensive review of all major agents causing bacterial 
meningitis--meningococcus of the groups A, B, C, W135, and Y, pneumococcus, and 
Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib)--is done in terms of preventing them by 
chemoprophylaxis or vaccination. Some evidence suggests that the group B 
meningococcal disease may also be very likely preventable by a vaccine that is 
already available. Excellent Hib conjugates use a technique that is expected to 
revolutionize immunoprophylaxis against most meningococcal and pneumococcal 
diseases in the near future. Unfortunately, the high cost of conjugate vaccines 
restricts their use in many poor countries.
