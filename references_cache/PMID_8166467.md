Lung cancer cases were abstracted from cancer registries in 20 countries to 
study the distribution of small cell lung cancer around 1985. The international 
patterns of small cell lung cancer resemble those of squamous cell tumours, and 
of lung cancer as a whole. Cigarette smoking and occupational risk factors are 
more strongly associated with squamous and small cell lung cancers than with 
adenocarcinoma. Inspection of sex differences and time trends in incidence show 
some differences which may relate to a higher risk for small cell lung cancer in 
female smokers than in males, and a less rapid decline in risk on smoking 
cessation.
