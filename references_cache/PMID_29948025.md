Few data exist regarding predictors of rapid aortic root dilation and referral 
for aortic surgery in Marfan syndrome (MFS). To identify independent predictors 
of the rate of aortic root (AoR) dilation and referral for aortic surgery, we 
investigated the data from the Pediatric Heart Network randomized trial of 
atenolol versus losartan in young patients with MFS. Data were analyzed from the 
echocardiograms at 0, 12, 24, and 36 months read in the core laboratory of 608 
trial subjects, aged 6 months to 25 years, who met original Ghent criteria and 
had an AoR z-score (AoRz) > 3. Repeated measures linear and logistic regressions 
were used to determine multivariable predictors of AoR dilation. Receiver 
operator characteristic curves were used to determine cut-points in AoR dilation 
predicting referral for aortic surgery. Multivariable analysis showed rapid AoR 
dilation as defined by change in AoRz/year > 90th percentile was associated with 
older age, higher sinotubular junction z-score, and atenolol use (R2 = 0.01) or 
by change in AoR diameter (AoRd)/year > 90th percentile with higher sinotubular 
junction z-score and non-white race (R2 = 0.02). Referral for aortic root 
surgery was associated with higher AoRd, higher ascending aorta z-score, and 
higher sinotubular junction diameter:ascending aorta diameter ratio (R2 = 0.17). 
Change in AoRz of 0.72 SD units/year had 42% sensitivity and 92% specificity and 
change in AoRd of 0.34 cm/year had 38% sensitivity and 95% specificity for 
predicting referral for aortic surgery. In this cohort of young patients with 
MFS, no new robust predictors of rapid AoR dilation or referral for aortic root 
surgery were identified. Further investigation may determine whether generalized 
proximal aortic dilation and effacement of the sinotubular junction will allow 
for better risk stratification. Rate of AoR dilation cut-points had high 
specificity, but low sensitivity for predicting referral for aortic surgery, 
limiting their clinical use. Clinical Trial Number ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT00429364.
