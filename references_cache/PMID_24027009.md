Lynch syndrome (LS) is a common cancer predisposition caused by an inactivating 
mutation in one of four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Frequently a variant of 
uncertain significance (VUS), rather than an obviously pathogenic mutation, is 
identified in one of these genes. The inability to define pathogenicity of such 
variants precludes targeted healthcare. Here, we have modified a cell-free assay 
to test VUS in the MMR gene PMS2 for functional activity. We have analyzed 
nearly all VUS in PMS2 found thus far and describe loss of MMR activity for 
five, suggesting the applicability of the assay for diagnosis of LS.
