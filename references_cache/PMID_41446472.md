Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare hereditary condition characterized by 
mucocutaneous pigmentation and hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps. We 
describe the case of a 14-year-old girl who presented with rectal bleeding, in 
whom endoscopic evaluation revealed multiple hamartomatous polyps, including two 
large rectal lesions. Histopathological analysis showed areas of high-grade 
dysplasia and in situ carcinoma developing within a hamartomatous polyp. 
Although this syndrome is generally benign, affected individuals have a lifelong 
predisposition to gastrointestinal and extra-digestive malignancies. Malignant 
transformation during adolescence is exceptionally uncommon, highlighting the 
importance of early diagnosis and structured surveillance to reduce cancer risk.
