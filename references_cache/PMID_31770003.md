Nasal nitric oxide concentrations are extremely low in primary ciliary 
dyskinesia (PCD), and measurement of this nasal gas is recommended as a PCD 
diagnostic test in cooperative patients aged 5 years and older. However, nasal 
nitric oxide measurements must be performed with chemiluminescence analyzers 
using a standardized protocol to ensure proper results, because nasal nitric 
oxide values can be influenced by various internal and external factors. Repeat 
nasal nitric oxide testing on separate visits is required to ensure that low 
diagnostic values are persistent and consistent with PCD. This technical paper 
presents the standard operating procedures for nasal nitric oxide measurement 
used by the PCD Foundation Clinical and Research Centers Network at various 
specialty centers across North America. Adherence to this document ensures 
reliable nasal nitric oxide testing and high diagnostic accuracy when employed 
in a population with appropriate clinical phenotypes for PCD.
