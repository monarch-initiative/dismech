## Content

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest forms of cancer worldwide. CRC development occurs mainly through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, which can last decades, giving the opportunity for primary prevention and early detection. CRC prevention involves different approaches, ranging from fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy screening to chemoprevention. In this review, we discuss the main findings gathered in the field of CRC chemoprevention, focusing on different target populations and on various precancerous lesions that can be used as efficacy evaluation endpoints for chemoprevention. The ideal chemopreventive agent should be well tolerated and easy to administer, with low side effects. Moreover, it should be readily available at a low cost. These properties are crucial because these compounds are meant to be used for a long time in populations with different CRC risk profiles. Several agents have been investigated so far, some of which are currently used in clinical practice. However, further investigation is needed to devise a comprehensive and effective chemoprevention strategy for CRC.
