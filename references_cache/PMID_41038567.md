Vertigo is a frequent reason for medical consultation and may result from a wide 
range of aetiologies. Betahistine and the fixed low-dose combination of 
cinnarizine 20 mg and dimenhydrinate 40 mg are commonly used therapeutic 
options, each with distinct antivertigo profiles. This systematic review, 
conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, aims to compare the efficacy 
and safety of these two treatments in patients with vertigo of various origins. 
A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google 
Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov, with no restrictions on language or publication 
date. Eligible studies included clinical trials and meta-analyses comparing the 
fixed low-dose combination (20 mg/40 mg) versus betahistine (12 or 16 mg), 
assessing efficacy through the Mean Vertigo Score (MVS) and safety based on the 
incidence of adverse events (AEs). The RoB 2 and ROBIS tools were used to 
evaluate the risk of bias. A total of nine studies were identified (six clinical 
trials and three meta-analyses). In five of the six clinical trials, the fixed 
low-dose combination significantly reduced MVS compared with betahistine at 
weeks 1 and/or 4 (p < .05); these findings were corroborated by the three 
meta-analyses. Regarding safety, both treatments were well tolerated, with no 
serious AEs reported and a generally lower incidence observed in the fixed 
low-dose combination group. Overall, the fixed low-dose combination demonstrated 
superior clinical efficacy from the first week of treatment, along with a more 
favourable tolerability and safety profile. These results support its 
preferential use in the management of acute vestibular syndrome.
