Whole blood dried onto filter paper constitutes a potentially useful material 
for molecular testing of viruses, including dengue. In order to assess the 
stability of viral RNA, we carried out dengue-RNA detection in whole blood 
infected with dengue virus that had been previously spotted onto filter paper. 
Filter papers were stored at room temperature, 4 and -70 degrees C and processed 
for PCR assay at intervals of 2, 4, 6 and 9 weeks. Our results demonstrated that 
dengue-RNA was stable in filter paper for 9 weeks at all tested temperatures. 
Furthermore, we evaluated these conditions using frozen sera and dried blood 
samples onto filter paper from 52 patients with confirmed clinical diagnosis of 
dengue infection. PCR results showed a 100% specificity and 93% sensitivity for 
dried blood samples. This storage method facilitates the transportation and 
analysis by nucleic acid amplification techniques even when freezing conditions 
are not available.
