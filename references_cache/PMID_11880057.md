Cholera dynamics in endemic regions display regular seasonal cycles and 
pronounced interannual variability. We review here the current quantitative 
evidence for the influence of climate on cholera dynamics with reference to the 
early literature on the subject. We also briefly review the incipient status of 
mathematical models for cholera and argue that these models are important for 
understanding climatic influences in the context of the population dynamics of 
the disease. A better understanding of disease risk related to the environment 
should further underscore the need for changing the socioeconomic conditions 
conducive to cholera.
