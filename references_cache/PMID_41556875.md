The scimitar syndrome is a rare congenital condition including a partial 
anomalous pulmonary venous return from the right lung into the inferior vena 
cava (IVC) which leads to a left-to-right shunt. Atypical variants with a dual 
drainage to both the IVC and the left atrium may be amenable to transcatheter 
occlusion. We report 3 patients diagnosed with scimitar syndrome with this dual 
drainage. Explorations confirmed the connection of the scimitar vein (SV) into 
both the IVC and the left atrium, with a significant left-to-right shunt and a 
right ventricular dilation. Pulmonary pressures were normal or mildly elevated. 
A compliant balloon occlusion test was performed at the IVC connection of the 
SV. All the patients underwent successfully a transcatheter occlusion of SV at 
the IVC junction using occlusion devices allowing proximal re-rerouting to the 
left atrium through the fistula. Aberrant systemic artery arising from the 
abdominal aorta was embolized in 2 cases during the same intervention.
