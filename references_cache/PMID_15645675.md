The human parvovirus B19 (B19), the only known human pathogenic parvovirus, was 
discovered in 1975. Like other parvoviruses it is a small (22-24 nm diameter) 
non-enveloped icosahedral virus, with a single-stranded genome. As part of its 
life history it replicates to high titre in the bone marrow, and in acute 
infection high titres of infectious virus are present in the peripheral blood. 
Parvovirus B19 is therefore not an uncommon 'contaminant' of blood and blood 
products. In addition the lack of lipid membrane envelope renders parvoviruses 
insensitive to solvent detergents, and the small genome confers relative 
resistance to heat and gamma irradiation. Many medical reviews have been written 
on the molecular biology, clinical features, approaches to diagnosis and 
management, and these should be consulted for more information. This review will 
give an overview of the biology of parvovirus B19 infection, and the more 
recently described variants of parvovirus B19.
