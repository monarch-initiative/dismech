Lyme disease is a tick-borne multisystem disorder transmitted by the family of 
Ixodes and caused by a spirochete, Borrelia. An early manifestation of the 
disease presents with skin lesions typically called Erythema chronicum migrans 
(ECM). Doxycycline should be the antibiotic of choice used for its treatment. 
However, we present the case of Lyme's disease in an adult male with dog tick, 
Rhipecephalus as a vector.
