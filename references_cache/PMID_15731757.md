We report heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding either type I or type II 
transforming growth factor beta receptor in ten families with a newly described 
human phenotype that includes widespread perturbations in cardiovascular, 
craniofacial, neurocognitive and skeletal development. Despite evidence that 
receptors derived from selected mutated alleles cannot support TGFbeta signal 
propagation, cells derived from individuals heterozygous with respect to these 
mutations did not show altered kinetics of the acute phase response to 
administered ligand. Furthermore, tissues derived from affected individuals 
showed increased expression of both collagen and connective tissue growth 
factor, as well as nuclear enrichment of phosphorylated Smad2, indicative of 
increased TGFbeta signaling. These data definitively implicate perturbation of 
TGFbeta signaling in many common human phenotypes, including craniosynostosis, 
cleft palate, arterial aneurysms, congenital heart disease and mental 
retardation, and suggest that comprehensive mechanistic insight will require 
consideration of both primary and compensatory events.
