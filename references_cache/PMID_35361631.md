BACKGROUND: Severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), phenotype PiZZ, is a 
risk factor for pulmonary emphysema and liver disease, but its effect on cancer 
risk is unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the risk and the risk factors for 
incident cancer in PiZZ individuals compared with the general population with 
known smoking habits.
METHODS: A longitudinal study of PiZZ individuals (n=1595) from the Swedish 
National AATD Register, and controls (n=5999) from Swedish population-based 
cohorts. Data on cancer and mortality were obtained by cross-linkage with 
national registers. Individuals who had undergone lung transplantation (n=10) 
and those with a cancer diagnosis within 5 years prior to inclusion (n=63) were 
excluded. The risk factors for developing cancer were analysed using 
proportional hazards and Fine-Gray regression models, adjusting for age, sex, 
smoking habits and the presence of liver disease.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 17 years (interquartile range 11 years) 
for the whole study population. The incidence rates of hepatic and non-hepatic 
cancer per 1000 person-years were 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3) and 8.5 (95% CI 
7.2-10.0), respectively, for the PiZZ individuals, and 0.1 (95% CI 0.04-0.2) and 
6.6 (95% CI 6.0-7.1), respectively, for the controls. The adjusted hazard ratios 
for hepatic and for non-hepatic cancer were 23.4 (95% CI 9.9-55.4) and 1.3 (95% 
CI 1.1-1.5), respectively, in the PiZZ individuals compared with the controls.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that individuals with severe AATD may have an 
increased risk of developing both hepatic and non-hepatic cancer, compared with 
the general population.
