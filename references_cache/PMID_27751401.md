In China, where air pollution has become a major threat to public health, public 
awareness of the detrimental effects of air pollution on respiratory health is 
increasing-particularly in relation to haze days. Air pollutant emission levels 
in China remain substantially higher than are those in developed countries. 
Moreover, industry, traffic, and household biomass combustion have become major 
sources of air pollutant emissions, with substantial spatial and temporal 
variations. In this Review, we focus on the major constituents of air pollutants 
and their impacts on chronic respiratory diseases. We highlight targets for 
interventions and recommendations for pollution reduction through industrial 
upgrading, vehicle and fuel renovation, improvements in public transportation, 
lowering of personal exposure, mitigation of the direct effects of air pollution 
through healthy city development, intervention at population-based level 
(systematic health education, intensive and individualised intervention, 
pre-emptive measures, and rehabilitation), and improvement in air quality. The 
implementation of a national environmental protection policy has become urgent.
