Haemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic diseases affecting patients 
of northern European ancestry. It is overdiagnosed in patients without iron 
overload and is underdiagnosed in many patients. Early diagnosis by genetic 
testing and therapy by periodic phlebotomy can prevent the most serious 
complications, which include liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. This 
Seminar includes an update on the origins of haemochromatosis; and an overview 
pathophysiology, genetics, natural history, signs and symptoms, differential 
diagnoses, treatment with phlebotomy, outcomes, and future directions.
