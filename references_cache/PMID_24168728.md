Absent calretinin-immunoreactive (CRir) mucosal innervation in aganglionic 
rectal biopsies is considered a useful diagnostic finding for Hirschsprung 
disease. Analysis of a series of rectosigmoid resections from patients with 
short-segment (>2-cm aganglionic, n  =  9) and very short-segment (≤2-cm 
aganglionic, n  =  9) Hirschsprung disease demonstrates that CRir mucosal nerves 
extend into the proximal 1-2 cm of aganglionic bowel, where their presence in 
distal rectal biopsies could complicate diagnosis of very short-segment disease. 
Indeed, retrospective analysis of preoperative, aganglionic, distal rectal 
biopsies from 4 of 9 patients with very short-segment Hirschsprung disease 
revealed CRir mucosal innervation. Accurate diagnosis was possible based on 
generous histopathological submucosal sampling to exclude ganglion cells and the 
presence of abundant large-caliber submucosal nerves (more than 4 nerves >30 µm 
thick/×200 field or more than 2 nerves >40 µm thick/×200 field). Absent CRir 
mucosal innervation supports the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease, but the 
presence of CRir mucosal nerves does not exclude aganglionosis, especially in 
distal rectal biopsies from patients with very short-segment Hirschsprung 
disease.
