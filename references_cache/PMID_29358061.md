Skeletal tuberculosis, otherwise known as Pott's disease, has been recognized 
for centuries. Although typically diagnosed in citizens from countries with 
endemic tuberculosis, long-term workers in these regions, such as military 
deployees, can also acquire the disease. We present a case report of a military 
veteran presenting with neck pain and initially diagnosed with cervical disc 
disease. The patient's pain progressed to the point of developing paresthesias 
in his bilateral upper extremities. Eventually, cervical spine radiographs were 
obtained that revealed complete cervical vertebral body destruction from spinal 
tuberculosis. Epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the disorder are 
discussed.
