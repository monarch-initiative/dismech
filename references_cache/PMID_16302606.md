Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 
various ocular and extraocular malformations. Dental abnormalities are 
considered as definitive features for the diagnosis and differentiation of 
Rieger syndrome from other anterior chamber of the eye malformations. A case of 
Rieger syndrome with distinct dental and craniofacial anomalies is described. 
Significant cranio-dento-facial findings that have been observed are, teeth with 
short and dilacerated roots, hyperplastic frenums and underdeveloped maxilla. 
There was an anterior crossbite, bilateral posterior open-bite and moderate to 
severe anterior crowding.
