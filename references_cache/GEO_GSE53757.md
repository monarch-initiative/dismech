# Gene array analysis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissue versus matched normal kidney tissue

## Content

Currently there is a lack of effective therapies which result in long-term durable response for patients presenting with advanced and metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This is due in part to a lack of molecular factors which can be targeted pharmacologically. In order to identify novel tumor-specific targets, we performed high throughput gene array analysis screening numerous patient ccRCC tumor tissues across all stages of disease, and compared their gene expression levels to matched normal kidney. Our results identify a number of genes which demonstrate tumor-specific overexpression, and may present as novel targets for therapy.
