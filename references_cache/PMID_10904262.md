Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease and 
rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata are progressive disorders characterized by 
loss of multiple peroxisomal metabolic functions. These diseases are inherited 
in an autosomal recessive manner, are caused by defects in the import of 
peroxisomal matrix proteins and are referred to as the peroxisome biogenesis 
disorders (PBDs). Recent studies have identified the PEX genes that are mutated 
in 11 of the 12 known complementation groups of PBD patients. This article 
reviews these advances in PBD genetics and discusses how studies of human PEX 
genes, their protein products and PBD cell lines are shaping current models of 
peroxisome biogenesis.
