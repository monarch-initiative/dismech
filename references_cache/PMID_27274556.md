Vitiligo is an acquired depigmentation disorder of unknown etiology. Medical 
treatments are usually reasonably effective for nonstable vitiligo patches; 
however, for vitiligo patches that have been stable for a substantial period of 
time, surgical intervention should be considered. In this article, surgical 
interventions for vitiligo are reviewed, including split-thickness skin 
grafting, suction blister grafting, miniature punch grafting, and cultured 
melanocyte transplantation.
