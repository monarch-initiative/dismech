A predisposing gene for breast and ovarian cancer has recently been mapped to 
chromosome 17q12-21. If this gene is a tumour suppressor gene, allele losses 
would be expected in the tumours of affected family members and the losses 
should affect the wild-type chromosome, reflecting the need for inactivation of 
the wild-type allele at the predisposing locus. In four multiple case 
breast-ovarian cancer families, we have found that in each of nine tumours which 
showed allele losses, the losses were from the wild-type chromosome. This 
suggests that the putative 'breast-ovarian' cancer gene is indeed a tumour 
suppressor gene.
