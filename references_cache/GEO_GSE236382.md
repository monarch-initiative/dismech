# Single-cell transcriptome characterization of the livers from patients with alcoholic liver disease

## Content

The immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) are still not fully understood. Here, we conducted an analysis of the transcriptome of liver immune cells using single-cell RNA sequencing. This study utilized single-cell data from liver samples of 5 ALD human cases. The study provides insights into the cellular diversity of liver immune cell populations in the pathogenesis of ALD and may offer potential foundations for tailored therapies in the future.
