Three interferon beta preparations (Betaseron, Avonex, and Rebif) have shown 
efficacy in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Attack 
frequency is reduced by 30% and major attacks to an even greater extent. 
Accumulating disease burden as measured by annual T2-weighted magnetic resonance 
imaging is markedly lessened, and disease activity as measured by serial 
gadolinium-enhanced MRI scanning is reduced by over 80%. A fourth preparation, 
Copaxone, a basic copolymer of four amino acids, lessens MS attack frequency by 
30% and also lessens disease activity as measured by gadolinium-enhanced MRI. 
Betaseron lessens accumulation of disability in MS patients with secondary 
progressive disease regardless of the severity of disability at the time 
treatment is commenced. MS is now a treatable disease.
