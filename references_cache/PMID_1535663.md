What ethical justification can be found for informing a person that he or she 
will later develop a lethal disease for which no therapy is available? This 
question has been discussed during the past twenty years by specialists 
concerned with the prevention of Huntington's Disease, an incurable late-onset 
hereditary disorder. Many of them have played an active role in developing 
experimental testing programmes for at-risk persons. This paper is based on a 
corpus of 119 articles; it reviews the development of their reflection and 
includes an outline of the ethical problems identified and the solutions adopted 
in pre-clinical protocols. Seen in a broader perspective, the experience of 
presymptomatic testing for Huntington's Disease has given medical geneticists 
the opportunity to clarify their ethical position in the as yet little explored 
field of predictive medicine.
