Livedo Reticularis: An Enigma.

Sangle SR, D'Cruz DP.

Livedo reticularis is a common cutaneous manifestation of APS and may be a 
prognostic marker of more severe disease. It is associated with arterial and 
venous thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity irrespective of the presence of 
antiphospholipid antibodies. Recent results suggest the possibility of an 
association with accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with livedo. Given the 
similarities between APS and livedo (aPL negative), experts in this field 
believe that livedo may represent the so-called seronegative antiphospholipid 
syndrome, although the exact relationship of livedo with seronegative APS 
remains to be elucidated. LV may present as painful cutaneous ulcers that are 
often difficult to treat. The underlying pathology involves prothrombotic as 
well as immunological processes with some overlap with APS. Treatment remains 
challenging and results are often variable.
