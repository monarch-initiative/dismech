# Genotype, Phenotype, and Disease Progression of Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy With Onset Before 2 Years of Age

## Content

According to estimates by the World Health Organization in 2019, more than 50 million people around the world have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of patients with epilepsy live in developing countries. Among them, children under 2 years old are the group with the highest incidence of epilepsy, and at the same time, the most dangerous epilepsy groups are also likely to start at these ages. World medical literature on epileptic encephalopathy and early-onset development before 2 years of age records that 71% of children have severe intellectual disability and 60% of children show signs of autism spectrum disorder, of which Children with epileptic and developmental encephalopathy due to genetic causes are at higher risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders than children with epileptic and developmental encephalopathy due to other causes. However, in Vietnam, there is no research on this topic.

The question is what are the phenotypes, genotypes, and progression after 2 years of follow-up of Vietnamese children with epileptic and developmental encephalopathy with onset before 2 years of age?
