BACKGROUND: High microsatellite instability (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC), 
caused by deficient mismatch repair, accounts for about 15% of all CRC cases and 
is more common in right-sided tumors. While early-stage MSI-H CRC has a 
relatively good prognosis, advanced cases often respond poorly to standard 
chemotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, have shown 
strong and lasting effects in MSI-H CRC. Pembrolizumab is now approved as a 
first-line treatment for metastatic MSI-H CRC due to its superior outcomes 
compared to traditional chemotherapy.
CASE SUMMARY: A 44-year-old male with MSI-H transverse colon cancer presented 
with hematochezia, abdominal pain, and significant weight loss. Imaging revealed 
a bulky tumor with invasion of adjacent structures and multiple liver lesions. A 
diverting ileostomy was performed followed by 36 cycles of pembrolizumab. The 
patient achieved a clinical and radiologic complete response. One month after 
completing the treatment, the patient underwent laparoscopic right 
hemicolectomy. A spontaneous transection of the colon at the original tumor site 
was unexpectedly identified. Final pathology confirmed pathological complete 
response (ypT0N0) with fibrosis. The patient recovered well after surgery, and 
follow-up showed no evidence of recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors may cause delayed structural damage to 
bowel tissue even after apparent complete tumor regression.
