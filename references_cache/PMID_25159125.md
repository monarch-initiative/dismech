Axonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis: can we predict and prevent permanent 
disability?

Lee JY, Taghian K, Petratos S.

Axonal degeneration is a major determinant of permanent neurological impairment 
during multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to the variable course of clinical disease 
and the heterogeneity of MS lesions, the mechanisms governing axonal 
degeneration may differ between disease stages. While the etiology of MS remains 
elusive, there now exist potential prognostic biomarkers that can predict the 
conversion to clinically definite MS. Specialized imaging techniques identifying 
axonal injury and drop-out are becoming established in clinical practice as a 
predictive measure of MS progression, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, these imaging techniques are still 
being debated as predictive biomarkers since controversy surrounds their 
lesion-specific association with expanded disability status scale (EDSS). A more 
promising diagnostic measure of axonal degeneration has been argued for the 
detection of reduced N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and Creatine ratios via magnetic 
resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging, but again fail with its specificity for 
predicting actual axonal degeneration. Greater accuracy of predictive biomarkers 
is therefore warranted and may include CSF neurofilament light chain (NF-L) and 
neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H) levels, for progressive MS. Furthermore, 
defining the molecular mechanisms that occur during the neurodegenerative 
changes in the various subgroups of MS may in fact prove vital for the future 
development of efficacious neuroprotective therapies. The clinical translation 
of a combined Na+ and Ca2+ channel blocker may lead to the establishment of a 
bona fide neuroprotective agent for the treatment of progressive MS. However, 
more specific therapeutic targets to limit axonal damage in MS need 
investigation and may include such integral axonal proteins such as the 
collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a molecule which upon 
post-translational modification may propagate axonal degeneration in MS. In this 
review, we discuss the current clinical determinants of axonal damage in MS and 
consider the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may initiate these 
neurodegenerative changes. In particular we highlight the therapeutic candidates 
that may formulate novel therapeutic strategies to limit axonal degeneration and 
EDSS during progressive MS.
