# Evaluation of the Impact of Anterior Veneers on the Quality of Life of Children With Amelogenesis Imperfecta

## Content

This project aims to evaluate the impact of anterior veneer treatment on oral health-related quality of life in children with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). AI is an inherited disorder that causes structural defects in enamel due to genetic abnormalities, leading to aesthetic, functional, and psychosocial challenges. Enamel defects, particularly in the anterior teeth, negatively affect patients' self-confidence and social interactions. In this study, the short-term aesthetic, functional, and psychosocial effects of veneer restorations applied to children with AI will be assessed.

This research is designed as a single-center, prospective clinical study. The study population will include pediatric patients aged 11-14 years who have been clinically and radiographically diagnosed with AI at our faculty clinic. Participants' oral health-related quality of life will be evaluated before treatment and one month after treatment using the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ11-14). Psychosocial improvement will be measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire (PIDAQ), while aesthetic satisfaction will be assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In addition, to objectively evaluate the participants' oral hygiene and dental health, the plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing index, and DMFT index will be recorded.

The data obtained are expected to demonstrate the positive impact of veneer treatment on the quality of life of children with AI, emphasizing the importance of early aesthetic rehabilitation in pediatric patients. In this respect, the study aims to provide a novel clinical and psychosocial contribution to the existing literature on the management of AI in pediatric dentistry.
