# Single-cell RNA landscape of osteoimmunology microenvironment in Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fracture (OVCF) and Kümmell's Disease (KD)

## Content

KD known as avascular necrosis after OVCF. we used scRNA-seq analysis to investigate the osteoimmunology microenvironment and cellular composition in OVCF and KD.
