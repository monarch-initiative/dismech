Gastrointestinal symptoms are a common feature of Addison's disease, but the 
diagnosis may be delayed because of the nonspecific nature of the symptoms. This 
report describes nine patients with Addison's disease who presented to our unit 
over the past 3 yr. Eight had severe or unusual gastrointestinal symptoms at 
presentation. One, already known to have Addison's disease, required several 
admissions to the hospital because of unexplained abdominal pain and vomiting 
before inadequate glucocorticoid replacement was diagnosed. All but one had 
previously attended the hospital, but the diagnosis of Addison's disease had 
been overlooked. Five eventually presented in crisis. It is important to exclude 
Addison's disease in all patients with unexplained abdominal symptoms.
