Schizophrenia is a complex disease with multifactorial etiology. The 
schizophrenia phenotype has been traditionally defined by chronic psychosis and 
functional deterioration. However, the boundary of the phenotype is likely to be 
more extensive than the one defined by chronic psychosis. This is highlighted by 
the findings of subtle, schizophrenia- like deficits in the nonschizophrenic, 
first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients. Subtle clinical signs and 
symptoms, cognitive impairment particularly in attention and memory, and 
neurophysiologic deficits such as in sensory gating and smooth-pursuit eye 
movements all define aspects of the schizophrenia phenotype.
