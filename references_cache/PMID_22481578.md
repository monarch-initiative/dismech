Dermoscopy is a noninvasive, in vivo method for the early diagnosis of malignant 
melanoma and the differential diagnosis of pigmented lesions of the skin. By 
allowing visualization of sub-macroscopic pigmented structures that correlate 
with specific underlying histopathologic structures, dermoscopy provides a more 
powerful tool than the naked-eye examination for clinicians to determine the 
need to excise a lesion. This article reviews the principles of dermoscopy, the 
most common dermoscopic patterns associated with nevi and melanoma, and the 
factors influencing the nevus pattern in a given individual.
