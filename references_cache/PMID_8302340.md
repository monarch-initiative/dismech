BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive motor neuron disease 
for which there is no adequate treatment. Some research suggests that the 
excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate may be involved in the 
pathogenesis.
METHODS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the antiglutamate agent 
riluzole, we conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 
155 outpatients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The dose of riluzole was 100 
mg per day. Randomization was stratified according to the site of disease onset 
(the bulbar region or the limbs). The primary end points were survival and rates 
of change in functional status. The main secondary end point was change in 
muscle strength. Analyses were undertaken after 12 months of treatment and at 
the end of the placebo-controlled period (median follow-up, 573 days).
RESULTS: After 12 months, 45 of 78 patients (58 percent) in the placebo group 
were still alive, as compared with 57 of 77 patients (74 percent) in the 
riluzole group (P = 0.014). For patients with bulbar-onset disease, one-year 
survival rates were 35 percent (6 of 17) with placebo and 73 percent (11 of 15) 
with riluzole (P = 0.014), whereas for those with limb-onset disease one-year 
survival was 64 percent and 74 percent, respectively (P = 0.17). The survival 
advantage with riluzole was smaller (37 percent [29 of 78] with placebo vs. 49 
percent [38 of 77] with riluzole) at the end of the placebo-controlled period, 
but it remained significant in the overall population (P = 0.046) as well as in 
the patients with bulbar-onset disease (18 percent [3 of 17] vs. 53 percent [8 
of 15], P = 0.013). The deterioration of muscle strength was significantly 
slower in the riluzole group than in the placebo group (P = 0.028). Adverse 
reactions to riluzole included asthenia, spasticity, and mild elevations in 
aminotransferase levels. Twenty-seven patients in the riluzole group withdrew 
from the study, as compared with 17 in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: The antiglutamate agent riluzole appears to slow the progression of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and it may improve survival in patients with 
disease of bulbar onset.
