Hypophosphatemia is a clinically significant but often underrecognized 
electrolyte abnormality in acute medicine, arising from decreased intake, 
increased losses, or intracellular redistribution. One uncommon cause is 
hyperventilation-induced respiratory alkalosis, which promotes intracellular 
phosphate shifting and enhanced glycolysis, leading to depletion of serum 
phosphate. Severe hypophosphatemia may result in neuromuscular, cardiovascular, 
and metabolic complications, necessitating prompt recognition and management. We 
report a case of a 38-year-old male patient referred to the Accident and 
Emergency (A&E) department by his general practitioner with severe 
hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate <0.20 mmol/L) and an elevated lactate level 
(2.4 mmol/L). He presented with shortness of breath, paresthesias of the upper 
and lower limbs, near-collapse episodes, hunger, sugar cravings over four 
months, and recurrent diarrheal episodes (six to eight per month). His history 
included Crohn's disease, anxiety disorder, muscle cramps, and recent weight 
gain (~6 kg). On examination, he demonstrated hyperventilation, with arterial 
blood gas showing respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.535). Investigations revealed 
normal calcium (2.6 mmol/L; reference range 2.1-2.6mmol/L) and ionized calcium 
on venous blood gas (1.27 mmol/L; reference range 0.8-1.5 mmol/L), normal 
thyroid function (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 1.5 mU/L), and no evidence 
of malabsorption or renal phosphate wasting. Differential diagnoses, including 
malabsorption syndromes, vomiting, hyperparathyroidism, Fanconi syndrome, and 
refeeding syndrome, were excluded. The patient received intravenous phosphate 
replacement with serial electrolyte monitoring to assess response and prevent 
hypocalcemia, followed by transition to oral phosphate supplementation. Symptoms 
resolved completely, and the serum phosphate level normalized. Hyperventilation 
related to anxiety likely caused excessive CO2 loss, triggering respiratory 
alkalosis, which increased intracellular phosphate utilization and lactate 
production. Although often overlooked, severe hypophosphatemia can cause muscle 
weakness, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, arrhythmias, and altered mental status if 
untreated. This case underscores the importance of recognizing metabolic 
disturbances in patients presenting with panic-like hyperventilation and 
supports early electrolyte assessment to prevent serious complications.
