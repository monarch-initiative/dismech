CD95 (Fas-ligand) is a key mediator of cell death in multiple setting, thus its 
loss within the MRL-lpr (Faslpr) homozygote mice results in spontaneous 
autoimmunity. This is characterized by the development of arthritis and immune 
complex glomerulonephrosis making this strain a useful model for studying 
systemic lupus erythematosus. Herein we describe a method to exploit the 
heterozygote offspring of this strain in a model to study the effects of a CD95L 
blocking peptide on lupus-like disease in vivo.
