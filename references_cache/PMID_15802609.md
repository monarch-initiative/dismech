Meningitis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality among children 
>5 years of age and is especially prevalent in developing countries. Effective 
routine immunization against Hib, pneumococcus and serogroupC meningococcus has 
had a significant impact on both invasive disease and carriage caused by these 
encapsulated bacteria. The major challenge in prevention of meningitis remains 
the delivery of vaccines worldwide, especially to resource-poor regions with the 
greatest disease burden.
