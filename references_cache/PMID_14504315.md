BACKGROUND: In response to Gulf War veterans' concerns of high rates of ALS, 
this investigation sought to determine if Gulf War veterans have an elevated 
rate of ALS.
METHODS: A nationwide epidemiologic case ascertainment study design was used to 
ascertain all occurrences of ALS for the 10-year period since August 1990 among 
active duty military and mobilized Reserves, including National Guard, who 
served during the Gulf War (August 2, 1990, through July 31, 1991). The 
diagnosis of ALS was confirmed by medical record review. Risk was assessed by 
the age-adjusted, average, annual 10-year cumulative incidence rate.
RESULTS: Among approximately 2.5 million eligible military personnel, 107 
confirmed cases of ALS were identified for an overall occurrence of 0.43 per 
100,000 persons per year. A significant elevated risk of ALS occurred among all 
deployed personnel (RR = 1.92; 95% CL = 1.29, 2.84), deployed active duty 
military (RR = 2.15, 95% CL = 1.38, 3.36), deployed Air Force (RR = 2.68, 95% CL 
= 1.24, 5.78), and deployed Army (RR = 2.04; 95% CL = 1.10, 3.77) personnel. 
Elevated, but nonsignificant, risks were observed for deployed Reserves and 
National Guard (RR = 2.50; 95% CL = 0.88, 7.07), deployed Navy (RR = 1.48, 95% 
CL = 0.62, 3.57), and deployed Marine Corps (RR = 1.13; 95% CL = 0.27, 4.79) 
personnel. Overall, the attributable risk associated with deployment was 18% 
(95% CL = 4.9%, 29.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Military personnel who were deployed to the Gulf Region during the 
Gulf War period experienced a greater post-war risk of ALS than those who were 
not deployed to the Gulf.
