## Content

Abstract
Background
Wnt/β-catenin signalling impairment accounts for 85% of colorectal cancers (CRCs), including sporadic and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) settings. An altered PI3K/mTOR pathway and gut microbiota also contribute to CRC carcinogenesis. We studied the interplay between the two pathways and the microbiota composition within each step of CRC carcinogenesis.

Methods
Proteins and target genes of both pathways were analysed by RT-qPCR and IHC in tissues from healthy faecal immunochemical test positive (FIT+, n = 17), FAP (n = 17) and CRC (n = 15) subjects. CRC-related mutations were analysed through NGS and Sanger. Oral, faecal and mucosal microbiota was profiled by 16 S rRNA-sequencing.

Results
We found simultaneous hyperactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/mTOR pathways in FAP-lesions compared to CRCs. Wnt/β-catenin molecular markers positively correlated with Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and negatively with Bacteroides in FAP faecal microbiota. Alistipes, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae were enriched in FAP stools and adenomas, the latter also showing an overabundance of Lachnoclostridium, which positively correlated with cMYC. In impaired-mTOR-mutated CRC tissues, p-S6R correlated with Fusobacterium and Dialister, the latter also confirmed in the faecal-ecosystem.

Conclusions
Our study reveals an interplay between Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/mTOR, whose derangement correlates with specific microbiota signatures in FAP and CRC patients, and identifies new potential biomarkers and targets to improve CRC prevention, early adenoma detection and treatment.
