Nutrition therapy and physical activity can assist persons with diabetes to 
achieve metabolic goals. Several lifestyle strategies can be used. Monitoring 
metabolic parameters, including blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, lipids, 
blood pressure, and body weight, as well as assessing for quality of life are 
essential to determine whether treatment goals are being achieved by lifestyle 
changes. If not, adjustments in the overall management plan need to be made.
