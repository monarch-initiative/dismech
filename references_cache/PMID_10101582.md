Multiple sclerosis frequently results in a wide range of symptoms which often 
coexist, creating a complex pattern of disability. Chief among these symptoms, 
both in relation to their frequency and their impact on the patient, are 
spasticity, ataxia and fatigue. This chapter discusses the pathological basis 
and current treatment of these symptoms and stresses the importance of a 
multidisciplinary approach to their management, producing a comprehensive care 
plan which incorporates these and any other coexisting problems.
