Teplizumab (teplizumab-mzwv; TZIELD™) is a CD3-directed monoclonal antibody 
(humanized IgG1κ) that is being developed by Provention Bio, Inc. for the 
treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). In November 2022, teplizumab was approved in 
the USA to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adults and pediatric patients 8 
years of age and older with Stage 2 T1D, based on results of a clinical trial in 
high-risk relatives of individuals with T1D. This article summarizes the 
milestones in the development of teplizumab leading to this first approval in 
the treatment of T1D.
