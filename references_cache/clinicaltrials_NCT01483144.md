# Phase III Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Eflornithine Combined With Sulindac Compared to Eflornithine, Sulindac as Single Agents in Patients With Familial Adenomatous Polyposis

## Content

The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, Phase III trial is to determine if the combination of eflornithine plus sulindac is superior to sulindac or eflornithine as single agents in delaying time to the first occurrence of any FAP-related event. This includes: 1) FAP related disease progression indicating the need for excisional intervention involving the colon, rectum, pouch, duodenum and/or 2) clinically important events which includes progression to more advanced duodenal polyposis, cancer or death.
