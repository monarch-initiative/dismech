Complications of Meckel's diverticulum.

Moore T, Johnston AO.

This paper reviews the presentation and surgical pathology of 50 Meckel's 
diverticula encountered in one hospital in a 20-year period. It is concluded 
that in children with intestinal bleeding or a "raspberry tumour" of the 
umbilicus a Meckel's diverticulum is usually suspected. In adults with an acute 
surgical emergency Meckel's diverticulum is unlikely to be considered. However, 
a Meckel's diverticulum can give rise to surgical problems in many ways and at 
any age. In particular, the possiblity of an attached mesodiverticular band 
leading to obstruction must be stressed.
