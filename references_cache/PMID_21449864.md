OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and diagnosis rates of Klinefelter 
syndrome (KS) in Victoria, Australia, and compare these to previous 
international findings.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A Victorian population-based descriptive study 
of all cytogenetic examinations resulting in a diagnosis of KS, including 
prenatal diagnoses from 1986 to 2006 and postnatal diagnoses from 1991 to 2006.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Birth prevalence and diagnosis rates of KS.
RESULTS: The birth prevalence of KS in Victoria is estimated to be 223 per 
100,000 males (95% CI, 195-254), with about 50% of cases remaining undiagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS: KS may be occurring more frequently than has been reported 
previously, yet many cases remain undiagnosed. Our results highlight the need 
for increased awareness leading to timely detection.
