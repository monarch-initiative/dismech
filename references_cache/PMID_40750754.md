This study examines the quality of life, functional independence, and family 
impact of children diagnosed with Joubert Syndrome (JS) to address gaps in the 
literature on its developmental and psychosocial challenges. A descriptive, 
cross-sectional study was conducted with 49 parents of children with JS in 
Turkey. Data were collected using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, 
Pediatric Functional Independence Measure, and Impact on Family Scale. 
Statistical analyses included descriptive and reliability assessments. Children 
with JS exhibited significant motor and cognitive delays, reduced functional 
independence, and lower quality of life. Feeding difficulties affected 38.8% of 
participants, highlighting the need for early nutritional interventions. 
Consanguineous marriage was reported by 61.2% of families, yet only 8.2% 
underwent genetic screening, emphasizing the importance of genetic counseling. 
Parents faced high psychosocial and economic burdens, underscoring the need for 
structured family support programs. The findings highlight the need for early, 
multidisciplinary interventions, including physical and speech therapy, 
nutritional support, and psychosocial care, to enhance functional independence 
and overall well-being. A comprehensive care model integrating neurology, 
pulmonology, rehabilitation, and genetic counseling is essential for improving 
outcomes in JS. A family-centered, multidisciplinary approach should be 
prioritized to improve patient care and caregiver support. Expanding 
rehabilitation services, genetic counseling, and structured family education can 
enhance long-term quality of life and independence in children with JS.
