The BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate induces complete cytogenetic 
response (CCR) in a high proportion of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) 
patients. However, patients in CCR usually demonstrate evidence of residual 
BCR-ABL-positive progenitors. The mechanisms underlying persistence of small 
numbers of malignant progenitors in imatinib-sensitive patients are unclear. 
BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations affecting drug binding can lead to secondary 
resistance to imatinib. We show here that kinase mutations could be detected in 
CD34+ cells isolated from CML patients in CCR on imatinib. Most mutations seen 
have not been reported in previous clinical studies. Interestingly, several of 
the involved amino acid positions have been implicated in an in vitro 
mutagenesis screen. These BCR-ABL mutations were associated with varying levels 
of imatinib resistance. Two of 5 patients in whom mutations were detected on 
initial evaluation have relapsed. In addition, 4 patients in whom mutations were 
not initially detected, but with rising BCR-ABL mRNA levels on quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) analysis, had mutations detected on follow-up 
evaluation. We conclude that BCR-ABL kinase mutations can be detected in CD34+ 
cells from CML patients in CCR on imatinib, may contribute to persistence of 
small populations of malignant progenitors, and could be a potential source of 
relapse.
