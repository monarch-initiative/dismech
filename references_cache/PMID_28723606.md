Visual snow is a symptom described as the continuous perception of tiny 
flickering dots in the entire field of vision, similar to static of an analog 
television. Visual snow syndrome is a cluster of symptoms found highly prevalent 
in patients that present with visual snow. While most of these symptoms appear 
to be visual in nature, approximately 63% of patients studied also report 
continuous bilateral tinnitus. The high correlation of visual-snow-syndrome 
patients presenting with tinnitus suggests that they may share a common 
underlying pathophysiology.
