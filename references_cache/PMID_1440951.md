Kawasaki syndrome, also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, is an acute 
vasculitis of infants and young children. We describe a four-year-old girl who 
presented with fever, a diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash, bilateral 
nonpurulent bulbar conjunctivitis, dry, red, fissured lips, a tongue with a 
strawberry "appearance", an erythematous pharynx, indurative erythema, and edema 
and desquamation of the face, hands and feet. She probably developed mitral 
valve prolapse during the course of the disease. The diagnosis of Kawasaki 
syndrome was arrived at by excluding other diseases and by the presence of all 
the clinical criteria for Kawasaki syndrome. Since this syndrome is rarely 
encountered in Turkey, this case is presented and the literature regarding the 
syndrome is reviewed.
