A new generation of bronchodilators is being developed for acute asthma 
management-single-isomer beta-agonists. These drugs consist only of the active 
bronchodilatory isomer (eutomer); they do not have the inactive and potentially 
harmful isomer (distomer) that is present in marketed racemic beta-agonists. 
Clinical studies comparing the effectiveness of (R)-albuterol (levalbuterol) 
with racemic albuterol established a strong rationale for using single-isomer 
beta-agonists in place of the racemic mixture: reduced dosages provide 
equivalent bronchodilatory effects with fewer beta-mediated side effects. Higher 
dosages achieve superior bronchodilation in episodes of severe asthma and may 
reduce costs of emergency department treatment.
