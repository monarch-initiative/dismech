OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and etiology of 
congestive heart failure (CHF) in older adults.
METHODS: Published reports relevant to the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and 
etiology of CHF were systematically reviewed. Studies involving older adults and 
more recent studies were emphasized.
RESULTS: More than 75% of patients with CHF in the United States are older than 
65 years of age, and CHF is the leading cause of hospitalization in older 
adults. CHF is also a major cause of chronic disability, and annual expenditures 
for CHF currently exceed $10 billion. In addition, both the incidence and 
prevalence of CHF are increasing, largely as a result of the aging of the 
population. Older adults are predisposed to developing CHF as a result of 
age-related changes in the cardiovascular system and the high prevalence of 
hypertension, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease in this age 
group. Although the fundamental pathophysiology of CHF is similar in younger and 
older patients, older individuals are more prone to develop CHF in the setting 
of preserved left ventricular systolic function. This syndrome, referred to as 
diastolic heart failure, accounts for up to 50% of all cases of CHF in adults 
more than 65 years of age. Coronary heart disease and hypertension are the most 
common etiologies of CHF in older adults, and they often coexist. Valvular heart 
disease, especially aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, are also common in 
older adults, whereas nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy occur less frequently.
CONCLUSIONS: Congestive heart failure is a major public health problem in the 
United States today as a result of its high and increasing prevalence in the 
older population as well as its substantial impact on healthcare costs and 
quality of life. There is an urgent need to develop more effective strategies 
for the prevention and treatment of CHF in older individuals.
