## Content

AbstractBackgroundThe Roma are a European ethnic minority threatened by several recessive diseases.Variants inMANBAcause a rare lysosomal storage disorder named beta-mannosidosis whose clinical manifestation includes deafness and mental retardation. Since 1986, only 23 patients with beta-mannosidosis and biallelicMANBAvariants have been described worldwide.ResultsWe now report on further 10 beta-mannosidosis patients of Roma origin from eight families in the Czech and Slovak Republics with hearing loss, mental retardation and homozygous pathogenic variants inMANBA.MANBAvariant c.2158-2A>G screening among 345 anonymized normal hearing controls from Roma populations revealed a carrier/heterozygote frequency of 3.77%. This is about 925 times higher than the frequency of this variant in the gnomAD public database and classifies the c.2158-2A>G variant as a prevalent, ethnic-specific variant causing hearing loss and mental retardation in a homozygous state. The frequency of heterozygotes/carriers is similar to another pathogenic variant c.71G>A (p.W24*) inGJB2, regarded as the most frequent variant causing deafness in Roma populations.ConlcusionBeta-mannosidosis, due to a homozygous c.2158-2A>GMANBAvariant, is an important and previously unknown cause of hearing loss and mental retardation among Central European Roma.
