The C. elegans Q neuroblasts and their descendants migrate along the 
anteroposterior (A/P) body axis to positions that are not associated with any 
obvious landmarks. We find that a novel protein, MIG-13, is required to position 
these cells correctly. MIG-13 is a transmembrane protein whose expression is 
restricted to the anterior and central body regions by Hox gene activity. MIG-13 
functions non-cell autonomously within these regions to promote migration toward 
the anterior: loss of mig-13 activity shifts the Q descendants toward the 
posterior, whereas increasing the level of MIG-13 shifts them anteriorly in a 
dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that MIG-13 is a component of a 
global A/P migration system, and that the level of MIG-13 determines where along 
the body axis these migrating cells stop.
