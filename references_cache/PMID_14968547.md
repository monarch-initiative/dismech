Aromatase, a key enzyme in estrogen synthesis, is tissue-specifically regulated 
in various tissues and plays an important role through endocrine and intracrine 
estrogen production in various physiological functions. Therefore, aromatase 
deficiency caused crucial impairments of physiological functions in the gonadal 
tissues as well as extra-gonadal tissues. Because aromatase is protective for 
androgenic exposure by catabolizing, virilization of a pregnant mother and 
pseudohermaphroditism of a baby girl consequently result from the deficiency. 
Similarly, because aromatase is productive for a multifunctional physiological 
factor, estrogens, impaired metabolisms of bone, carbohydrate, and fat etc. 
result from the deficiency. We discuss the etiology, clinical symptoms, and 
therapeusis by classifying it into two types of complete and incomplete 
aromatase deficiencies.
