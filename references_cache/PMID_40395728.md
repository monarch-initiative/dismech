Campylobacter jejuni is a typical zoonotic bacterium, colonizing the gut of many 
bird species as commensal. In humans, C. jejuni is a major foodborne pathogen. 
Infection of humans causes campylobacteriosis in the small intestine, 
constituting a main source of bacteria-dependent gastroenteritis cases 
worldwide. In particular, the ingestion of under-cooked rooster meat, raw milk 
and contaminated water, as well as cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food 
after handling raw chicken meat, are responsible for the majority of C. jejuni 
infections. As a consequence, infected individuals may acquire watery and/or 
bloody diarrhea associated with abdominal pain, and eventually post-infection 
illnesses of the neural system and joints, including the Guillain-Barré, Miller 
Fisher and Reiter syndromes. One therapeutic strategy is to reduce C. jejuni 
colonization in chicken farms using vaccination, bacteriocins and phage therapy 
protocols. Prevention approaches during poultry meat processing comprise the 
compliance to high hygiene standards. Furthermore, substantial progress has been 
also made in recent years to combat campylobacteriosis using established mouse 
and in vitro cell model systems. In this regard, specific C. jejuni 
colonization- and pathogenicity-associated components were considered as favored 
treatment structures, targeting bacterial movement, host cell interaction, 
intracellular survival, propagation and spread of the bacteria. This has been 
complemented by a number of pharmaceutical compounds to reduce C. jejuni-induced 
epithelial cell damage, inflammation and apoptosis in infected mice. Here we 
review these novel treatment and prevention as well as "One World - One Health" 
approaches that aim to diminish the consequences of acute campylobacteriosis and 
post-infection sequelae in humans.
