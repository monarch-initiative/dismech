## Content

Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by SPINK5 mutations, resulting in a deficiency in its processed protein LEKTI. It is clinically characterized by the triad of congenital ichthyosis, atopic diathesis, and hair shaft abnormalities. The SPINK5 (NM_006846.4): c.1258A>G polymorphism (rs2303067) shows a significant association with atopy and atopic dermatitis (AD), which share several clinical features with NS. We describe an NS patient, initially misdiagnosed with severe AD, who carried the heterozygous frameshift (null) mutation (NM_006846.4): c.957_960dup combined with homozygous rs2303067 in the SPINK5 gene. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis, whereas an immunohistochemical study showed normal epidermal expression of LEKTI, despite the genetic findings. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of SPINK5, in the presence of a SPINK5 null heterozygous mutation in combination with homozygous SPINK5 rs2303067 polymorphism, can be causative of an NS phenotype, impairing the function of LEKTI despite its normal expression. Due to the clinical overlap between NS and AD, we suggest performing SPINK5 genetic testing to search for the SPINK5 (NM_006846.4): c.1258A>G polymorphism (rs2303067) and ensure a correct diagnosis, mainly in doubtful cases.
