Trisomy-21 mosaicism (mT21) with subclinical intellectual development disorder 
or physical phenotype has very rarely been associated with early-onset cognitive 
decline. Notably, early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) patients' family 
histories frequently suggest genetic causes other than autosomal-dominant 
APP/PSEN-1/2 mutations. We present an EOAD patient in his late fifties newly 
diagnosed with low-degree mT21 (13%/21% blood lymphocytes/ectodermal cells). We 
applied fluorescence in-situ hybridization to confirm a diagnosis of mT21. 
Multimodal positron-emission-tomography applying 18F-fluodesoxyglucose 
(metabolism), 18F-florbetaben (amyloid-β deposits) and 18F-PI-2620 
(tau-deposits) tracers was used to confirm a diagnosis of EOAD according to the 
ATN-criteria of AD. Initial PET-studies revealed marked cerebral amyloid-β- and 
tau-pathology and parietotemporal hypometabolism, confirming EOAD according to 
the ATN-criteria of AD. A marked cognitive decline was accompanied by an 
increase in tau pathology in follow-up studies. This is the first case 
demonstrating that a low-degree APP gene-dose increase suffices to cause EOAD 
with prominent amyloid-β/tau pathology.
