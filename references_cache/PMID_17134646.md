Marfan syndrome is a widespread disorder of connective tissue. It is 
characterized by systemic and ocular features due to mutations in the fibrillin 
gene. Awareness and prompt recognition of the ocular complications of Marfan 
syndrome may enable improvement and preservation of sight. Studies have been 
performed in the last few years that enable a better understanding of the 
genetics of the syndrome, earlier diagnosis, and improvement in the surgical 
techniques and options.
