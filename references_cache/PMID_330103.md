Kidney in lupus erythematosus.

Rothfield NF.

The pathologic abnormalities present in patients with SLE have been classified 
as follows: minimal lupus nephritis, mild (focal) proliferative lupus nephritis, 
severe (diffuse) proliferative lupus nephritis, and membranous lupus nephritis. 
Changes in individual patients from one form of nephritis to another are 
observed infrequently. Pathologic evidence of activity is usually present in 
patients with hematuria, although it may be found in patients with no evidence 
of clinical renal disease. Complement components and titer of antibody to native 
DNA may be helpful in estimating disease activity.
