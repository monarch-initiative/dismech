Heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the human progranulin gene 
(GRN) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) by a mechanism of 
haploinsufficiency. Patients present most frequently with frontotemporal 
dementia, which is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia at young 
age. Currently, no disease-modifying therapies are available for these patients. 
Stimulating GRN protein expression or inhibiting its breakdown is an obvious 
therapeutic strategy, and is indeed the focus of current preclinical research 
and clinical trials. Multiple studies have demonstrated the heterogeneity in 
clinical presentation and wide variability in age of onset in patients carrying 
a GRN LOF mutation. Recently, this heterogeneity became an opportunity to 
identify disease modifiers, considering that these might constitute suitable 
targets for developing disease-modifying or disease-delaying therapies.
