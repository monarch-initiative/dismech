BACKGROUND: Some hydatid cysts of cystic echinococcosis type 1 (CE1) lack 
well-defined cyst walls or distinctive endocysts, making them difficult to 
differentiate from simple hepatic cysts.
AIM: To investigate the diagnostic methods for atypical hepatic CE1 and the 
clinical efficacy of laparoscopic surgeries.
METHODS: The clinical data of 93 patients who had a history of visiting endemic 
areas of CE and were diagnosed with cystic liver lesions for the first time at 
the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (China) from January 
2018 to September 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical diagnoses were 
made based on findings from serum immunoglobulin tests for echinococcosis, 
routine abdominal ultrasound, high-frequency ultrasound, abdominal computed 
tomography (CT) scan, and laparoscopy. Subsequent to the treatments, these 
patients underwent reexaminations at the outpatient clinic until October 2023. 
The evaluations included the diagnostic precision of diverse examinations, the 
efficacy of surgical approaches, and the incidence of CE recurrence.
RESULTS: All 93 patients were diagnosed with simple hepatic cysts by 
conventional abdominal ultrasound and abdominal CT scan. Among them, 16 patients 
were preoperatively diagnosed with atypical CE1, and 77 were diagnosed with 
simple hepatic cysts by high-frequency ultrasound. All the 16 patients 
preoperatively diagnosed with atypical CE1 underwent laparoscopy, of whom 14 
patients were intraoperatively confirmed to have CE1, which was consistent with 
the postoperative pathological diagnosis, one patient was diagnosed with a 
mesothelial cyst of the liver, and the other was diagnosed with a hepatic cyst 
combined with local infection. Among the 77 patients who were preoperatively 
diagnosed with simple hepatic cysts, 4 received aspiration sclerotherapy of 
hepatic cysts, and 19 received laparoscopic fenestration. These patients were 
intraoperatively diagnosed with simple hepatic cysts. During the follow-up 
period, none of the 14 patients with CE1 experienced recurrence or implantation 
of hydatid scolices. One of the 77 patients was finally confirmed to have CE 
complicated with implantation to the right intercostal space.
CONCLUSION: Abdominal high-frequency ultrasound can detect CE1 hydatid cysts. 
The laparoscopic technique serves as a more effective diagnostic and therapeutic 
tool for CE.
