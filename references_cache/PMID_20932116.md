Evidence of a link between headache symptoms and cardiovascular disease has 
rapidly grown in recent years and it is of utmost importance for the 
cardiologist and neurologist to be aware of this intimate connection. A brief 
overview of different cardiovascular diseases (namely hypertension, stroke, 
coronary heart disease, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defects, atrial 
septal aneurisms, mitral valve prolapse, and aortic and carotid disease) that 
may be related to headache is presented in this article. Proposed 
pathophysiological mechanisms for this association and landmark studies are 
reviewed and discussed.
