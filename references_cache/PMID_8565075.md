Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through 
signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a 
TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. 
Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal 
transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 
mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative 
inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced 
apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a 
dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit 
NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to 
bifurcate at TRADD.
