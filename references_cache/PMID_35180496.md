A simple, ready-to-use concentrated specimen smear microscopy method employing a 
nanometer silicon polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer membrane sandwich 
filtration vessel to concentrate acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in samples (SFV-CSSM, 
Hunan-Tech New Medical System Co. Ltd. China) was compared with direct sputum 
smear microscopy (DSSM) to determine its performance using culture on modified 
Ogawa agar as reference. The results for 4114 clinical samples collected from 
health facilities in Sabah were interpreted with reference to culture results, 
sample collection-transportation conditions and clinical data including 
responses to anti-TB drug treatment. The SFV-CSSM showed higher sensitivity than 
DSSM (79.4% versus 60.5%) and less background interference. Its ability to 
detect low levels of AFB at an affordable cost makes it an excellent tool for 
the screening of pauci-bacillary samples as well as for active case finding in 
TB control programs.
