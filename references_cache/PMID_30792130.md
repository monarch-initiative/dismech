Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), also known as immotile-cilia syndrome, is a 
rare genetic disease that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Several 
studies have explored certain aspects of PCD in the Arab world, yet much is 
still lacking in terms of identifying the different characteristics of this 
disease. In this paper, we aim to briefly cover those studies published about 
PCD in Arab countries, as well as to provide recommendations and guidelines for 
future studies.
