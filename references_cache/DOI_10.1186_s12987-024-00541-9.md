Abstract
Background
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a central feature of cerebral malaria (CM), a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infections. In CM, sequestration of Pf-infected red blood cells (Pf-iRBCs) to brain endothelial cells combined with inflammation, hemolysis, microvasculature obstruction and endothelial dysfunction mediates BBB disruption, resulting in severe neurologic symptoms including coma and seizures, potentially leading to death or long-term sequelae. In vitro models have advanced our knowledge of CM-mediated BBB disruption, but their physiological relevance remains uncertain. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells (hiPSC-BMECs), we aimed to develop a novel in vitro model of the BBB in CM, exhibiting enhanced barrier properties.

Methods
hiPSC-BMECs were co-cultured with HB3var03 strain Pf-iRBCs up to 9 h. Barrier integrity was measured using transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and sodium fluorescein permeability assays. Localization and expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin, zonula occludens-1, claudin-5), cellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), and endothelial surface markers (EPCR) were determined using immunofluorescence imaging (IF) and western blotting (WB). Expression of angiogenic and cell stress markers were measured using multiplex proteome profiler arrays.

Results
After 6-h of co-culture with Pf-iRBCs, hiPSC-BMECs showed reduced TEER and increased sodium fluorescein permeability compared to co-culture with uninfected RBCs, indicative of a leaky barrier. We observed disruptions in localization of occludin, zonula occludens-1, and claudin-5 by IF, but no change in protein expression by WB in Pf-iRBC co-cultures. Expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 but not EPCR was elevated in hiPSC-BMECs with Pf-iRBC co-culture compared to uninfected RBC co-culture. In addition, there was an increase in expression of angiogenin, platelet factor-4, and phospho-heat shock protein-27 in the Pf-iRBCs co-culture compared to uninfected RBC co-culture.

Conclusion
These findings demonstrate the validity of our hiPSC-BMECs based model of the BBB, that displays enhanced barrier integrity and appropriate TJ protein localization. In the hiPSC-BMEC co-culture with Pf-iRBCs, reduced TEER, increased paracellular permeability, changes in TJ protein localization, increase in expression of adhesion molecules, and markers of angiogenesis and cellular stress all point towards a novel model with enhanced barrier properties, suitable for investigating pathogenic mechanisms underlying BBB disruption in CM.
