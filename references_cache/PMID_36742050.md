BACKGROUND: Third window syndrome is a vestibular-cochlear disorder in humans in 
which a third mobile window of the otic capsule creates changes to the flow of 
sound pressure energy through the perilymph/endolymph. The nature and location 
of this third mobile window can occur at many different sites (or multiple 
sites); however, the most common third mobile window is superior semicircular 
canal dehiscence (SSCD). There are two essential objective diagnostic 
characteristics needed to validate a model of SSCD: the creation of a 
pseudoconductive hearing loss and cVEMP increased amplitude and decreased 
threshold.
METHODS: Adult Mongolian gerbils (n = 36) received surgical fenestration of the 
superior semicircular canal of the left inner ear. ABR and c+VEMP testing were 
carried out prior to surgery and over acute (small 1 mm SSCD, 1-10 days) or 
prolonged (large 2 mm SSCD, 28 days) recovery. Because recovery of function 
occurred quickly, condenser brightfield stereomicroscopic examination of the 
dehiscence site was carried out for the small SSCD animals post-hoc and compared 
to both ABRs and c+VEMPs. Micro-CT analysis was also completed with 
representative samples of control, day 3 and 10 post-SSCD animals.
RESULTS: The SSCD created a significant worsening of hearing thresholds of the 
left ear; especially in the lower frequency domain (1-4 kHz). Left (EXP)/right 
(CTL) ear comparisons via ABR show significant worsening thresholds at the same 
frequency representations, which is a proxy for the human pseudoconductive 
hearing loss seen in SSCD. For the c+VEMP measurements, increased amplitude of 
the sound-induced response (N1 2.5 ms and P1 3.2 ms) was observed in animals 
that received larger fenestrations. As the bone regrew, the c+VEMP and ABR 
responses returned toward preoperative values. For small SSCD animals, micro-CT 
data show that progressive osteoneogenesis results in resurfacing of the SSCD 
without bony obliteration.
CONCLUSION: The large (2 mm) SSCD used in our gerbil model results in similar 
electrophysiologic findings observed in patients with SSCD. The changes observed 
also reverse and return to baseline as the SSCD heals by bone resurfacing (with 
the lumen intact). Hence, this model does not require a second surgical 
procedure to plug the SSCD.
