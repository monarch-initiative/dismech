Infections caused by human parvovirus B19 result in a variety of clinical 
manifestations, the severity of which depends on the immune and hematologic 
status of the host. Arthropathy is known to occur in children and adults with 
acute parvovirus B19 infection. In adults, the arthropathy is common and is 
usually brief and self-limited, although a chronic arthropathy due to HPV B19 
infections can occur rarely. It is important to differentiate between such 
chronic infection and RA, because of the similar clinical manifestations and 
different modes of treatment. An association between HPV B19 and other 
rheumatologic diseases such as vasculitis needs further research before 
confirmation is possible.
