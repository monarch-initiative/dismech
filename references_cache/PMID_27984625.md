Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized 
by retinopathy, obesity, and polydactyly. So far 21 candidate genes have been 
discovered, and mutations of such genes can all cause the BBS phenotype. As one 
of the main features of the disease, the obesity in BBS has been associated with 
leptin resistance and abnormal adipogenesis. However, its molecular etiology is 
not yet completely clear. Here the molecular mechanism of BBS-associated obesity 
is reviewed.
