Echinococcosis is a zoonotic larval infection that infects humans globally. The 
parasite Echinococcus causes the disease. According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the global burden of controlling the disease exceeds three 
billion US dollars annually. There are several identified species of 
Echinococcosis, four of which are of concern in humans: 1. Echinococcus 
granulosus: infections cause cystic echinococcosis, also called hydatidosis. 2. 
Echinococcus multilocularis: infections cause alveolar echinococcosis. 3. 
Echinococcus vogeli: infections cause polycystic echinococcosis. 4. Echinococcus 
oligarthrus: infections cause polycystic echinococcosis. This article will 
discuss and summarize the essential aspects of Echinococcus granulosus 
infections.
