The association with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in adults with atopic dermatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, but findings are inconsistent. Objectives: To examine the association between adult AD and the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Methods: We performed a systematic review and random effects meta-analysis. Results: No association was observed between AD and unspecified but suspected type 2 diabetes [pooled odds ratio (OR) 1·11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·87-1·42]. However, AD was associated with type 2 diabetes when explicitly defined, with a pooled OR of 1·37 (95% CI 1·17-1·61). Conclusions: Adult AD is associated with type 2 diabetes when explicitly defined, whereas no association was seen for unspecified but suspected type 2 diabetes.
