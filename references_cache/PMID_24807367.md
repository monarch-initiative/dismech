Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and is the commonest 
cause of dementia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were developed under 
the cholinergic hypothesis of AD. Therapeutic strategies with these drugs aimed 
to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in specific parts of the brain, and to 
improve the clinical symptoms of AD. Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are 
commonly used AChEIs in pharmacotherapy for AD, slowing the progression and 
controlling the symptoms of AD. Although these drugs have different 
pharmacological properties, there is no clear evidence of differences between 
them with respect to efficacy. It is possible to adapt AChEIs for the 
pharmacotherapy of other conditions, such as vascular dementia, dementia with 
Lewy bodies, and Down syndrome.
