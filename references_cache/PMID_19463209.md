Common asthma triggers during recreational activities include allergen exposure, 
concomitant viral infection, and exercise. We present the case of a 42-year-old 
man with a 2-year history of wheezing, chest tightness, and upper respiratory 
symptoms that were associated with surfing. He denied symptoms with other forms 
of exercise and had no personal history of asthma. His physical exam was 
unremarkable and his pre- and postbronchodilator spirometry was normal. After 
detailed history and keen observation on the patient's part, a diagnosis was 
made and he enjoyed good response to the therapy for this condition. 
Underrecognized asthma triggers and exposures in the recreational environment 
should be investigated.
