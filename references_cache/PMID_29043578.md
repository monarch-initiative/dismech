Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease is rare as most often the disease is found in the 
terminal ileum and colon rather than the upper gastrointestinal tract. The most 
common phenotype is stricturing disease which can lead to obstructive-like 
symptoms. Medical treatment options include proton pump inhibitors and biologic 
therapy. Endoscopic and surgical intervention may be needed to relieve the 
obstructive-like symptoms from the stricturing phenotype.
