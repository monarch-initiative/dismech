Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of insoluble aggregates of the 
microtubule-associated protein tau. In Alzheimer's disease the accumulation of 
neurofibrillary tangles occurs in the absence of tau mutations. Here we present 
mice that develop pathology from non-mutant human tau, in the absence of other 
exogenous factors, including beta-amyloid. The pathology in these mice is 
Alzheimer-like, with hyperphosphorylated tau accumulating as aggregated paired 
helical filaments. This pathologic tau accumulates in the cell bodies and 
dendrites of neurons in a spatiotemporally relevant distribution.
