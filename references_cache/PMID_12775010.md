Taurodontism is a morphoanatomical change in the shape of a tooth, which usually 
occurs in multirooted teeth. An enlarged body and pulp chamber, as well as 
apical displacement of the pulpal floor, are characteristic features. Endodontic 
treatment of a taurodont tooth is challenging, because it requires special care 
in handling and identifying the number of root canals. A case of endodontic 
treatment of a maxillary first molar with taurodontism is presented.
