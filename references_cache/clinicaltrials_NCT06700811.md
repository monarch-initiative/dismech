# Phase 1 Study of Ketogenic Diet for Prevention of Epileptic Spasms in Infantile Onset Genetic Epilepsies

## Content

Epileptic spasms (ES) are a predominantly infantile seizure type observed frequently in certain genetic disorders. Ketogenic diet (high ratio of fat to carbohydrate/protein) is an established non-medication treatment for difficult to control seizures, including ES. Because ES are associated with worse developmental and cognitive outcomes if not detected or treated quickly and effectively, this trial aims to test the ketogenic diet to prevent ES in this high-risk population. This trial is a single-center pilot study of 10 infants with genetic seizure disorders to establish if the protocol of early ketogenic diet administration and ES evaluation is safe and feasible.
