# Single-cell RNA-seq of endothelial and pericyte populations in the mouse cochlear stria vascularis

## Content

The cochlear stria vascularis (SV) maintains the endocochlear potential and relies on specialized vascular endothelial cells and pericytes. To characterize the transcriptional profiles of these vascular populations at single-cell resolution, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on SV tissue from reporter mice. SV was microdissected from temporal bones of 1–3 month-old Tie2-GFP (endothelial reporter) and NG2-DsRed (pericyte reporter) mice, enzymatically dissociated to obtain single-cell suspensions, and, when applicable, subjected to FACS enrichment for Tie2-GFP–positive endothelial cells or NG2-DsRed–positive pericytes. Viable cells were loaded onto the 10x Genomics Chromium platform for single-cell capture and 3′ barcoded library preparation. This dataset contains two independent batches corresponding to SV endothelial cell–enriched and pericyte-enriched preparations and enables analysis of vascular heterogeneity within the mouse stria vascularis.
