This article aims to discuss the concepts of Social Determination of Health and 
Social Determinants of Health, by establishing a comparison between each of 
their guiding perspectives and investigating their implications on the 
development of health policies and health actions. We propose a historical and 
conceptual reflection, highlighting the Theory on the Social Production of 
Health, followed by a debate on the concepts, with a comparative approach among 
them.
