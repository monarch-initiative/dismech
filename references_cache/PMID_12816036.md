Hemoptysis is a common respiratory symptom that always requires investigation. 
Its severity varies from bloodstained sputum to life-threatening hemoptysis. 
Blood originates most often from bronchial circulation. The most common causes 
of hemoptysis are tuberculosis, lung carcinoma, bronchiectasis but idiopathic 
forms are frequent. The diagnostic investigation is based mainly on history, 
chest radiograph, fibroscopy and CT scan of the thorax. The goal is to determine 
the cause as well as the site of bleeding. The management of life-threatening 
hemoptysis is mainly based on either surgical approach or bronchial artery 
embolization. The majority of centers favor this latter approach.
