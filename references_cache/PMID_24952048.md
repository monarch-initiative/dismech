Cholera.

Burnett MW.

Vibrio cholerae is a comma-shaped, gram-negative rod that produces an 
enterotoxin, which causes an acute-onset diarrheal disease ranging in severity 
from mild to life threatening. Worldwide, there are an estimated 3?5 million 
cases per year, with more than 100,000 deaths. The disease remains a significant 
cause of death and illness in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia (especially 
Bangladesh and India), and Haiti, and the infection should be recognized by the 
Special Operations Forces (SOF) medical provider.
