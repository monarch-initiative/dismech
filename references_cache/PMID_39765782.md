Hypertension (HTN) is a major contributor to kidney damage, leading to 
conditions such as nephrosclerosis and hypertensive nephropathy, significant 
causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). HTN 
is also a risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease. Oxidative stress, 
inflammation, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
play critical roles in causing kidney injury in HTN. Genetic and environmental 
factors influence the susceptibility to hypertensive renal damage, with African 
American populations having a higher tendency due to genetic variants. Managing 
blood pressure (BP) effectively with treatments targeting RAAS activation, 
oxidative stress, and inflammation is crucial in preventing renal damage and the 
progression of HTN-related CKD and ESRD. Interactions between genetic and 
environmental factors impacting kidney function abnormalities are central to HTN 
development. Animal studies indicate that genetic factors significantly 
influence BP regulation. Anti-natriuretic mechanisms can reset the 
pressure-natriuresis relationship, requiring a higher BP to excrete sodium 
matched to intake. Activation of intrarenal angiotensin II receptors contributes 
to sodium retention and high BP. In HTN, the gut microbiome can affect BP by 
influencing energy metabolism and inflammatory pathways. Animal models, such as 
the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the chronic angiotensin II infusion 
model, mirror human essential hypertension and highlight the significance of the 
kidney in HTN pathogenesis. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
plays a crucial role in the development and progression of HTN, impacting renal 
function and BP regulation. Targeting specific NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms to 
inhibit ROS production and enhance antioxidant mechanisms may improve renal 
structure and function while lowering blood pressure. Therapies like SGLT2 
inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have shown promise in 
reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and RAAS activity, offering renal and 
antihypertensive protection in managing HTN and CKD. This review emphasizes the 
critical role of NOX in the development and progression of HTN, focusing on its 
impact on renal function and BP regulation. Effective BP management and 
targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and RAAS activation, is crucial in 
preventing renal damage and the progression of HTN-related CKD and ESRD.
