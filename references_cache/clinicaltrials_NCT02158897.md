# Effect of a Periodic Fasting-mimicking Diet on Risk Factors for Metabolic Syndrome and Age-related Diseases

## Content

Evidence from bio-gerontology research from our laboratory and others have showed that short-term fasting/starvation (STS) can improve the efficacy of chemotherapy by protecting normal cells and tissues and potentially sensitizing malignant cells to chemo drugs. Furthermore, STS improves risk factors associated with aging and age-related disease in rodent models. Prolonged fasting, however, is difficult to implement and may not be feasible or safe in humans. We have developed a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) that was well accepted in a pilot human trial. The objective of the study is to ascertain the impact of the fasting-mimicking diet given to adult subjects for 5 days a month for 3 consecutive months. The investigators hypothesize that the specially designed dietary regimen can reduce the risk factors for metabolic syndrome and biomarkers associated with aging and age-related diseases.
