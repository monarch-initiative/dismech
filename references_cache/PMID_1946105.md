Addison's disease is a possible diagnosis in any patient who presents with 
weakness, weight loss, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, and hypotension. 
Laboratory findings, including depressed levels of cortisol and aldosterone, 
help to confirm the diagnosis. Computed tomography may reveal adrenal 
calcification and abnormal-sized adrenal glands. In most cases, autoimmune 
destruction of the adrenal cortex is the cause of Addison's disease; however, as 
in the patient described here, tuberculosis is a possible cause.
