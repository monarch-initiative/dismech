Review of calcium-channel blockers.

Stowe HO.

Calcium-channel blocking drugs were introduced to the United States in 1982. The 
three approved calcium-channel blockers--nifedipine, verapamil and 
diltiazem--have offered new treatments for angina. This article presents an 
overview of these drugs with emphasis on their mechanisms of action, clinical 
use and guidelines for the nurse practitioner in assessing the need for 
calcium-channel blockers in the management of angina.
