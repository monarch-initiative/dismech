Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) is a common problem in clinical practice. Left 
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is pathognomonic of HHD. Echo-Doppler study is the 
modality of choice to document cardiac involvement in hypertension. 'Radiology 
of chest and electrocardiography (ECG) are highly insensitive. Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) produces similar results like echo but is not 
cost-effective. LVH is not merely related to haemodynamic load but several other 
factors are also involved in its genesis. LVH is a powerful and independent 
prognostic determinant for future cardiovascular and coronary events. LVH can be 
regressed by drugs but the aim in future should be prevention of LVH rather than 
its regression.
