## Content

The goal of the study was to analyze gene expression profle from the WD patients who underwent liver transplantation for acute or chronic liver failure. Control specimens were obtained from patients who underwent liver resections for other clinical reasons. We used microarrays (Affymetrix) to determine the gene expression profile in WD
