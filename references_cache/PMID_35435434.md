INTRODUCTION: During the recent past, dengue fever and associated complications 
have been the most important concern for health policy makers of Sri Lanka. The 
current notification system has considerable inevitable delays in preventive 
measures.
OBJECTIVES: Implementing a laboratory-based real-time antigen (NS1) surveillance 
system for notification coupled with a rapid preventive response within the 
Colombo district as a pilot project and compares the notifications with existing 
national surveillance systems.
METHODS: An online notification platform was established with a centralized 
database. Seven main laboratories of the private sector linked with the 
notification system, where they can create new notifications at the central 
database, whenever the NS1 test detected as positive. Relevant Medical Officers 
of Health should update action implemented to complete the response process. A 
dashboard was designed to visualize each notification and its status with a 
predefined colour code.
RESULTS: Patients from 14 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas out of 15 were 
captured. The immediate preventive response was recorded from the field 
preventive staff for 90% of the reporting. All most all attended patients have 
given health advice on awareness, prevention, and source reduction through 
premise inspection by trained field staff with 24hrs of notification.
CONCLUSIONS: Salient features of the novel system are notification of 
antigen-positive patients, the rapidity of notification (real-time) and 
response, user-friendliness, access to multiple stakeholders simultaneously 
without data duplication, early involvement of the field staff, the ability to 
trace the cases using checklists and a color-coding system from a dashboard.
