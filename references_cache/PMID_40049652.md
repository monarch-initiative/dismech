Early-life undernutrition is known to be a potentially important risk factor for 
the development of diabetes mellitus in adult life. Additionally, some 
literature suggests that undernutrition during later life or adulthood may lead 
to metabolic consequences, including diabetes, despite an individual's normal 
nutritional status earlier in life. Notably, individuals with diabetes and 
undernutrition show some unique features that do not fit the usual phenotype of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, such as a low body mass index of <18.5 kg/m2, 
resistance to ketosis, and low serum C-peptide levels. Many global descriptions 
of this unique phenotype have led to a controversy that 
"undernutrition-associated diabetes mellitus" is a distinct form of diabetes, 
deserving a separate diabetes category in the WHO classification of diabetes. 
However, a few investigators argue that undernutrition-associated diabetes 
mellitus is one of the variants of the classical forms of diabetes. The second 
controversy is whether adult undernutrition is independently associated with 
metabolic abnormalities. Its pathophysiology has been difficult to determine, 
given confounding factors such as infections that can complicate the direct 
effects of malnutrition. Studies have shown that insulin deficiency due to 
pancreatic β-cell impairment is likely to contribute to the development of 
undernutrition-associated diabetes. To examine these controversies, further 
research is warranted to understand the role of undernutrition in the 
pathogenesis of undernutrition-associated diabetes. This review aims to shed 
more light on these controversies, focusing on whether diabetes in malnourished 
individuals represents a distinct diabetes category and the association between 
malnutrition and diabetes in adults.
