Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS, OMIM 209900) is a ciliopathy causing multivisceral 
abnormalities. This disease is mainly characterized by obesity, post-axial 
polydactyly, hypogenitalism, intellectual disabilities, pigmentary retinopathy, 
and renal deficiency. The prevalence of BBS has been estimated in different 
populations, ranging from 1 in 160,000 in European populations to 1 in 13,000 in 
Bedouins from Kuwait. In the present report, we present the first 
epidemiological study of Bardet-Biedl syndrome in Tunisia. From 1984 to 2009, 46 
Tunisian families, including 67 affected members, were diagnosed as BBS. The 
patients' ages ranged between 6 months and 37 years, with median age of 
10.4 years. High level of consanguinity was noted in our cohort (93.47%). The 
overall minimum prevalence in our population was estimated to be approximately 1 
in 156,000 individuals. Our study reflects the actual frequency of BBS in North 
Africa and showed that this disease seems uncommon.
