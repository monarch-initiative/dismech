Infectious disease transmission is a nonlinear process with complex, sometimes 
unintuitive dynamics. Modeling can transform information about a disease process 
and its parameters into quantitative projections that help decision makers 
compare public health response options. However, modelers face methodologic 
challenges, data challenges, and communication challenges, which are exacerbated 
under the time constraints of a public health emergency. We review methods, 
applications, challenges and opportunities for real-time infectious disease 
modeling during public health emergencies, with examples drawn from the two 
deadliest pandemics in recent history: HIV/AIDS and coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19).
