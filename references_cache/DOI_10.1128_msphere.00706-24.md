ABSTRACT



              Recurrent
              C. difficile
              infection (rCDI) is an urgent public health threat, for which the last resort and lifesaving treatment is a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). However, the exact mechanisms that mediate a successful FMT are not well-understood. Here, we use longitudinal stool samples collected from patients undergoing FMT to evaluate intra-individual changes in the microbiome, metabolome, and lipidome after successful FMTs relative to their baselines pre-FMT. We show changes in the abundance of many lipids, specifically a decrease in acylcarnitines post-FMT, and a shift from conjugated bile acids pre-FMT to deconjugated secondary bile acids post-FMT. These changes correlate with a decrease in Enterobacteriaceae, which encode carnitine metabolism genes, and an increase in Lachnospiraceae, which encode bile acid altering genes such as bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) and the bile acid-inducible (
              bai
              ) operon, post-FMT. We also show changes in gut microbe-encoded amino acid biosynthesis genes, of which Enterobacteriaceae was the primary contributor to amino acids
              C. difficile
              is auxotrophic for. Liquid chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry, and mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS) revealed a shift from microbial conjugation of primary bile acids pre-FMT to secondary bile acids post-FMT. Here, we define the structural and functional changes associated with a successful FMT and generate hypotheses that require further experimental validation. This information is meant to help guide the development of new microbiota-focused therapeutics to treat rCDI.
            

IMPORTANCE

                Recurrent
                C. difficile
                infection is an urgent public health threat, for which the last resort and lifesaving treatment is a fecal microbiota transplant. However, the exact mechanisms that mediate a successful FMT are not well-understood. Here, we show changes in the abundance of many lipids, specifically acylcarnitines and bile acids, in response to FMT. These changes correlate with Enterobacteriaceae pre-FMT, which encodes carnitine metabolism genes, and Lachnospiraceae post-FMT, which encodes bile salt hydrolases and
                baiA
                genes. There was also a shift from microbial conjugation of primary bile acids pre-FMT to secondary bile acids post-FMT. Here, we define the structural and functional changes associated with a successful FMT, which we hope will help aid in the development of new microbiota-focused therapeutics to treat rCDI.
