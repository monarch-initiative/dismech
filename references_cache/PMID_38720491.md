Background: There is a clinical imperative to devise metrics to prognosticate 
dengue severity. Our objective was to determine the association between 
longitudinal trends in atypical lymphocytes and large immature cell count with 
platelet count and dengue severity. Materials and methods: Retrospective 
analysis of longitudinally measured clinical and hematological data from (n = 
79) hospitalized dengue patients was done. Results: The cohort consisted of 
patients with dengue fever without warning signs (DFWOWS) (n = 40, females = 14, 
and age = 19.9 ± 14.6 years), dengue fever with warning signs (DFWWS) (n = 36, 
females = 13, and age = 16.1 ± 14.1 years) and severe dengue (n = 3, females = 
2, and age = 5.3 ± 4 years). Platelet count increased at a rate of 11,524 
cells/mm3/day, with a slower rate of rise as the severity increased (p = 
0.001***). Concurrently hematocrit and neutrophil percentage decreased, while 
the lymphocyte percentage and white blood cell (WBC) count increased during the 
hospital stay. Every 1% increase in atypical lymphocyte count (ATY) was 
associated with a fall in platelet count by 16,963 cells/mm3 (p = 0.001***). A 
similar but weaker trend was found for large immature cells (LICs). Conclusion: 
The data support the usefulness of longitudinal tracking of atypical lymphocyte 
and large immature cell count for dengue prognosis. The time trends of the 
hematological parameters indicate the progression of patients from the critical 
to the recovery phase. How to cite this article: Peraka R, Koppula A, Muppala
