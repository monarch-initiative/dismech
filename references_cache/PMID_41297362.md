BACKGROUND: Each year, more than 30 million people worldwide are admitted to 
intensive care units (ICUs) with life-threatening illness or injury. While 
advances in intensive care have improved survival, many continue to face 
long-term consequences after discharge. Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), 
encompassing physical, cognitive, psychological, and social impairments, 
profoundly affects everyday life, family dynamics, and the ability to return to 
previous activity levels. Prevalence estimates vary, but more than half of 
individuals surviving an ICU admission remain affected 1 year after discharge. 
Although research has often focused on isolated symptoms, less is known about 
how these domains interact and shape recovery. Exploring this interconnectedness 
from the perspectives of individuals with a previous ICU admission and their 
relatives is essential for guiding person-centred rehabilitation strategies.
AIM: This study explored how individuals with a previous ICU admission and their 
relatives experience the interconnections between physical, cognitive, 
psychological, and social domains of PICS in the months following discharge.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary qualitative content analysis of data 
originally collected in a phenomenological-hermeneutic study. Semistructured 
single and dyadic interviews were carried out with 18 individuals with a 
previous ICU admission and 14 relatives (partners, parents, or children) at 3 
and 6 months after ICU discharge. Participants were recruited from two Danish 
hospitals. Data analysis followed Elo and Kyngäs' approach, combining deductive 
and inductive phases: the PICS framework guided the deductive coding, while 
inductive analysis allowed new themes to emerge. The study adhered to the 
Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research.
FINDINGS: Participants described persistent challenges across all four PICS 
domains. These were rarely experienced in isolation but overlapped, shaping 
everyday struggles such as managing energy, coping with memory difficulties, and 
maintaining social connections. Relatives provided perspectives that both 
complemented and extended the accounts of individuals with a prior ICU 
admission, highlighting how the interplay between domains influenced recovery 
trajectories.
CONCLUSION: Recovery after critical illness is shaped by the interconnected 
nature of physical, cognitive, psychological, and social challenges, with 
fatigue emerging as a central factor affecting all domains. The findings 
underscore the need for integrated, multidimensional rehabilitation strategies 
that actively include both individuals with a previous ICU admission and their 
relatives.
