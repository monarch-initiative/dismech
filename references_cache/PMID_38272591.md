Type 1 diabetes is associated with both acute and chronic complications. Acute 
complications include diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia. Chronic 
complications can be microvascular or macrovascular. Microvascular complications 
include retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. The pathophysiology of 
microvascular complications is complex. Hyperglycemia is a common underlying 
risk factor, underscoring the importance of optimizing glycemic management. 
Patients with type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk of macrovascular 
complications including coronary artery disease and vascular disease. The 
American Diabetes Association provides screening guidelines for chronic 
complications of diabetes. Adherence to these guidelines is an important aspect 
of diabetes care.
