The Hedgehog signaling pathway is essential for many aspects of normal embryonic 
development, including formation and patterning of the neural tube. Absence of 
the sonic hedgehog (shh) ligand is associated with the midline defect 
holoprosencephaly, whereas increased Shh signaling is associated with 
exencephaly and spina bifida. To complicate this apparently simple relationship, 
mutation of proteins required for function of cilia often leads to impaired Shh 
signaling and to disruption of neural tube closure. In this article, we review 
the literature on Shh pathway mutants and discuss the relationship between Shh 
signaling, cilia, and neural tube defects.
