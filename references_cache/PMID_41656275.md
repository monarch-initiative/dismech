Voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels are tetrameric complexes of proteins encoded by 
KCN genes. Gain-of-function (GoF) mutations in KCNH1 (Kv10.1, hEAG1) and KCNH5 
(Kv10.2, hEAG2) give rise to developmental disorders, intellectual disability, 
and epilepsy. Currently, clinical symptoms are not straightforwardly associated 
with functional properties of mutated channels. Here we investigated how members 
of the KCNH subfamily are affected by heteromerization with mutant Kv10.1 or 
Kv10.2 protein subunits. The de novo variant Kv10.1-G496E, which leads to 
impaired neurodevelopment and epilepsy, was expressed alone or with other 
wild-type subunits in HEK293T cells and characterized using whole-cell patch 
clamp. While Kv10.1-G496E alone did not yield functional K+ channels, 
coexpression with Kv10.1 or Kv10.2 shifted the half-maximum voltage of 
activation in the hyperpolarizing direction. Likewise, the homologous mutation 
Kv10.2-G465E did not yield functional channels but also induced GoF upon 
coexpression with wild-type Kv10.1 or Kv10.2. By contrast, the mutants did not 
affect the function of Kv11.1 (KCNH2, hERG1) channels. To infer the relevance of 
Kv10 GoF mutations under physiological conditions, we used the fluorescent 
genetically encoded voltage indicator mK2-rEstus and found that both, Kv10.1 and 
Kv10.2, hyperpolarized HEK293T cells, and that coexpression of the GoF mutants 
augmented this hyperpolarization. Our findings imply that interpretation of 
clinical symptoms related to Kv10 GoF mutations requires considering the 
functional crosstalk with Kv10.1 and Kv10.2 subunits, which are both expressed 
in glutamatergic neurons in cortical Layers III and IV.
