BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is the standard treatment for end-stage renal 
disease. Particularly, rare and specific pathogenic infections which are 
asymptomatic are often difficult to diagnose, causing delayed and ineffective 
treatment and thus seriously affecting prognosis. Tropheryma whipplei (T. 
whipplei) is a Gram-positive actinomycete widely found in soil, sewage, and 
other external environments and is present in the population as an asymptomatic 
pathogen. There is relatively little documented research on T. whipplei in renal 
transplant patients, and there are no uniform criteria for treating this group 
of post-transplant patients. This article describes the treatment of a 
42-year-old individual with post-transplant T. whipplei infection following 
kidney transplantation.
CASE SUMMARY: To analyze clinical features of Whipple's disease and summarize 
its diagnosis and treatment effects after renal transplantation. Clinical data 
of a Whipple's disease patient treated in the affiliated hospital of Guizhou 
Medical University were collected and assessed retrospectively. The treatment 
outcomes and clinical experience were then summarized via literature review. The 
patient was admitted to the hospital due to recurrent diarrhea for 1 mo, 
shortness of breath, and 1 wk of fever, after 3 years of renal transplantation. 
The symptoms of the digestive and respiratory systems were not significantly 
improved after adjusting immunosuppressive regimen and anti-diarrheal, empirical 
antibiotic treatments. Bronchoscopic alveolar fluid was collected for 
meta-genomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). The deoxyribonucleic acid 
sequence of Tropheryma whipplei was detected, and Whipple's disease was 
diagnosed. Meropenem, ceftriaxone, and other symptomatic treatments were given, 
and water-electrolyte balance was maintained. Symptoms resolved quickly, and the 
patient was discharged after 20 d of hospitalization. The compound 
sulfamethoxazole tablet was continued for 3 mo after discharge. No diarrhea, 
fever, and other symptoms occurred during the 6-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Whipple's disease is rare, with no specific symptoms, which makes 
diagnosis difficult. Polymerase chain reaction or mNGS should be immediately 
performed when the disease is suspected to confirm the diagnosis.
