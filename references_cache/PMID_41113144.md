OBJECTIVE: Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is a potentially life-threatening 
complication during nutritional rehabilitation in malnourished patients, 
especially those in intensive care units (ICUs). This study aimed to develop and 
internally validate a clinical prediction model for assessing the risk of RFS in 
adult ICU patients.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted at Beijing 
Jishuitan Hospital from January 2022 to November 2023. Adult ICU patients at 
high risk for RFS, identified by nutritional assessment, were included. RFS was 
defined as a >10% decrease in serum phosphorus, potassium, or magnesium within 5 
days after refeeding. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected 
from electronic medical records. For the biochemical data, the baseline (the day 
before refeeding), peak (highest measurements during the first five days after 
refeeding), and latest value (the fifth day after refeeding) value were 
analyzed. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, with stepwise 
selection, identified independent predictors. Model performance was evaluated by 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (area under the curve, 
AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA), with internal 
validation performed using bootstrap resampling.
RESULTS: A total of 132 ICU patients were included (RFS group, n=86; non-RFS 
group, n=46). Baseline characteristics, illness severity scores, and 
comorbidities, were generally comparable between groups. Multivariable analysis 
showed that higher peak urine epithelial cell count (OR=1.145, 95% CI: 
1.023-1.282), lower baseline total bilirubin (OR=0.969, 95% CI: 0.940-1.000), 
lower peak potassium (OR=0.383, 95% CI: 0.147-0.995), and lower latest relative 
lymphocyte count (OR=0.946, 95% CI: 0.897-0.997) were independently associated 
with RFS risk. The model demonstrated good discrimination (AUC=0.78, 95% CI: 
0.69-0.87) and calibration. DCA indicated clinical utility across a range of 
risk thresholds.
CONCLUSION: This internally validated model accurately predicts RFS risk in 
high-risk adult ICU patients, potentially improving early identification and 
individualized nutritional management. Further external validation is needed 
before wider clinical application.
