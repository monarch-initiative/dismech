The first known Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreak caused by Bundibugyo 
Ebola virus occurred in Bundibugyo District, Uganda, in 2007. Fifty-six cases of 
EHF were laboratory confirmed. Although signs and symptoms were largely 
nonspecific and similar to those of EHF outbreaks caused by Zaire and Sudan 
Ebola viruses, proportion of deaths among those infected was lower (≈40%).
