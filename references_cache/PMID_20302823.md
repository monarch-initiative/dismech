Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that affects 1% of the population 
worldwide. Although its molecular etiology remains unclear, recent advances in 
human psychiatric genetics have identified a large number of candidate genetic 
risk factors involved in schizophrenia. Modeling the disease in genetically 
tractable animals is thus a challenging but increasingly important task. In this 
review, I discuss the potential problems and perspectives associated with 
modeling schizophrenia in fruit flies, and briefly review the recent studies 
analyzing the molecular and cellular functions of Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 
(DISC1) in transgenic flies.
