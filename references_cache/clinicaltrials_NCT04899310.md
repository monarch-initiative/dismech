# A Global Phase 1/2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacodynamics, and Pharmacokinetics of mRNA-3705 in Participants With Isolated Methylmalonic Acidemia Due to Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase Deficiency

## Content

This is a study of mRNA-3705 in participants with isolated elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) due to methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) mutase (MUT) deficiency. The main goal of the study is to assess safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of intravenously (IV)-infused mRNA-3705.
