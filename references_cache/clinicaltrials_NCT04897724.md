# The Clinical Performance of Direct Posterior Composite Restorations in Patients With Amelogenesis Imperfecta

## Content

In AI patients, adhesion still remains the first option in order to achieve an early, minimally invasive intervention, and the altered enamel still represents an acceptable substrate for bonding in some AI variants. Many cases have revealed that the direct composite restorations provide satisfactory esthetic and functionality in restoring AI-affected teeth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of composite restorations in posterior teeth in patients afflicted with Amelogenesis Imperfecta using nanohybrid and nanofill composite materials
