a substantial proportion of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 
adenocarcinoma in particular, depends on a so-called 'driver mutation' for their 
malignant phenotype. This genetic alteration induces and sustains tumorigenesis, 
and targeting of its protein product can result in growth inhibition, tumor 
response and increased patient survival. NSCLC can thus be subdivided into 
clinically relevant molecular subsets. Mutations in EGFR best illustrate the 
therapeutic relevance of molecular classification. This article reviews the 
scope of presently known driving molecular alterations, including ROS1, BRAF, 
KRAS, HER2 and PIK3CA, with a special emphasis on aLK rearrangements, and 
outlines their potential therapeutic applications.
