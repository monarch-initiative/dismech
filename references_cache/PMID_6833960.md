Kawasaki disease.

Soman M, Faulkner S, Snively GG.

Kawasaki disease is an acute, multisystem illness that predominantly affects 
young children and has been described throughout the world. The triphasic course 
includes an initial phase of acute illness marked by high fever, conjunctival 
injection, oral changes, and erythematous rash. The second, subacute, phase 
begins with a decline of the acute findings and proceeds with desquamation of 
rash, joint manifestations, thrombocytosis, and cardiac disease. Most deaths (1 
to 2 percent of cases) occur in this phase, usually resulting from myocardial 
infarction. During the third phase all signs of clinical illness subside. The 
prognosis is related to the degree of cardiac involvement, and 14 to 20 percent 
of patients develop coronary artery aneurysms. Inhibition of platelet 
aggregation, combined with symptomatic relief and supportive measures, forms the 
cornerstone of therapy. Family physicians need to be aware of this illness, 
particularly since it can no longer be considered rare.
