In the course of China's rapid economic development, the coexistence of 
industrial development and dominant industrial agglomeration (AGG), along with 
growing environmental problems, has attracted widespread attention from 
scholars. Although the linear relationship between the two has been analyzed in 
depth in the research literature, a concomitant phenomenon, i.e., the gradual 
expansion in the scale of foreign direct investment (FDI), has been overlooked. 
By employing threshold panel regression model, this paper attempts to construct 
a theoretical model with embedded AGG and FDI, and incorporates other factors 
affecting environmental pollution (POL). For examining the mechanism of AGG on 
POL, we proposed a testable theoretical hypothesis, and conducted an empirical 
study by combining panel data of POL and AGG at the provincial level in China. 
The measurement index of a control variable was changed to check the robustness 
of our results, and the coefficient sign of each explanatory variable was not 
changed, confirming the robustness of main results. Overall, AGG improves 
regional POL, but the impact of FDI is stage-specific and roughly there are 
three stages. Specifically, the positive effect of AGG on POL is strong when FDI 
is at a low level. When the level of FDI crosses the first threshold and 
continues to rise, the positive effect of AGG on POL reaches its strongest; 
until the second threshold is crossed, the positive effect of AGG starts 
diminishing slowly. Concluding this, for promoting economic development and 
environmental protection in the region in parallel, government and enterprises 
should prioritize the increment in FDI, with an equalization of levels of AGG 
and FDI, in order to enhance the improvement effect of AGG on POL.
