We identified 21 children (14 boys and seven girls) with long-segment 
Hirschsprung's disease defined as aganglionosis extending proximal to the 
ileocecal valve. Long-segment Hirschsprung's disease is difficult to diagnose 
and treat; symptoms may be mild, and diagnosis delayed. Abdominal distention and 
constipation or delayed passage of meconium are the most common symptoms. 
Radiologic studies are unreliable in establishing the diagnosis. The morbidity 
rate is high because of the high transition zone and short gut. The long-term 
outcome of patients after the standard Duhamel procedure is satisfactory, except 
with extremely high transition zones. Pull-through procedures should not be 
performed in the small infant, but should be delayed until patients are old 
enough to be continent.
