BACKGROUND: Peutz-Jeghers (PJ) syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomal dominant 
genetic disease characterized by the association of intestinal polyposis, 
mucosal skin pigmentation, and cancer susceptibility. PJS patients have a 
significantly increased risk of malignant tumors in the gastrointestinal tract 
and extra-gastrointestinal tract, including various epithelial malignant tumors 
(colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and 
ovarian cancer, etc.). PJS is commonly seen in children and adolescents with 
multiple small intestinal polyps, often causing intussusception.
CASE SUMMARY: A 62-year-old male presented with intermittent left lower 
abdominal pain after drinking or consuming cold beverages that was accompanied 
by occasional hematochezia. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography 
indicated an isolated sigmoid colon grape-like lesion. Subsequently, the patient 
underwent laparoscopic surgery, and the pathological diagnosis was PJ 
hamartomatous polyp. PJS was not considered at the initial visit, as the patient 
was older, and the facial pigmentation was not obvious. However, significant 
pigmentation was observed in the perineum during digital rectal examination. 
Interestingly, we observed that the patient exhibited nodular shadows in the 
adrenal glands computed tomography images that may be related to pigmentation. 
Therefore, we performed the determination of adrenal cortical hormones, but the 
results were not abnormal. Combined with skin and mucosal pigmentation and 
laboratory examinations, the patient was diagnosed with PJS. After laparoscopic 
sigmoid colon resection, the patient's symptoms improved, and no discomfort 
symptoms were reported in the later follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The age of onset and lesion location of this case are different from 
those of typical or isolated PJS patients.
