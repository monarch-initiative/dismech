Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) progresses through multiple 
phases, including immune tolerant, immune active, immune control, and, in a 
subset of patients who achieve immune control, reactivation. The first, the 
immune tolerant phase, is considered to be prolonged in duration but essentially 
benign in nature, lacking long-term consequences, and thus not recommended for 
antiviral therapy. This review challenges the notion that the immune tolerant 
phase is truly benign and considers the possibility that events during this 
phase may contribute significantly to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
and the premature death of 25% of HBV carriers worldwide. Thus, earlier 
treatment than recommended by current guidelines should be considered. Low 
therapeutic coverage exacerbated by restrictive treatment guidelines may 
facilitate disease progression in many patients but also increase the risk of 
neonatal and horizontal transmission from untreated mothers to their children. 
While a prophylactic vaccine exists, there are many areas worldwide where the 
treatment of adults and the delivery of an effective vaccination course to 
newborns present difficult challenges.
