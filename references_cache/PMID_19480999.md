B19 infection-associated joint symptoms occur most frequently in adults, usually 
presenting as a self-limited, acute symmetric polyarthritis affecting the small 
joints of the hands, wrists, and knees. A small percentage of patients persist 
with chronic polyarthritis that mimics rheumatoid arthritis raising the question 
of whether B19 virus may have a role as a concomitant or precipitating factor in 
the pathogenesis of autoimmune conditions. Comprehensive and updated reviews 
address different aspects of human parvovirus infection. This article focuses on 
the evidence supporting the arthritogenic potential of the B19 virus and the 
proposed mechanisms that underlie it.
