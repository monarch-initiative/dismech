Previous studies found conflicting results about associations of vitiligo with 
different autoimmune diseases. To evaluate associations of vitiligo with 
multiple autoimmune diseases. A cross-sectional study representative of 
612,084,148 US patients from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) 
2015-2019 was performed. Vitiligo and autoimmune diseases were identified using 
International Classification of Diseases-10 codes. The most frequent autoimmune 
disorders in patients with vitiligo were type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoimmune thyroiditis, Addison's disease, 
and systemic sclerosis (SSc). Vitiligo was associated with any autoimmune 
disorder (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.45 [1.32-1.58]). 
Cutaneous disorders with largest effect-sizes were alopecia areata (186.22 
[115.31-300.72]) and SSc (32.13 [25.28-40.82]). Non-cutaneous comorbidities with 
largest effect-sizes were primary sclerosing cholangitis (43.12 [18.98-97.99]), 
pernicious anemia (41.26 [31.66-53.78]), Addison's disease (33.85 [26.68-42.9]), 
and autoimmune thyroiditis (31.65 [26.34-38.02]). Vitiligo is associated with 
multiple cutaneous and non-cutaneous autoimmune diseases, especially in females 
and older age.
