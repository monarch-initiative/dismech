Monkeypox in Patient Immunized with ACAM2000 Smallpox Vaccine During 2022 
Outbreak.

We report a case of monkeypox in the United States in a patient who had been 
vaccinated with ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine 8 years earlier. Despite his 
vaccination status, he still contracted disease. He showed prodromal symptoms 
preceding development of painless penile lesions that later coalesced.
