Glucose and ketone body kinetics in diabetic ketoacidosis.

Miles JM, Gerich JE.

The hyperglycaemia and hyperketonaemia of diabetic ketoacidosis are initiated 
primarily by overproduction of these substrates; subsequent maintenance of 
hyperglycaemia occurs, in large part, due to impaired utilization of glucose, 
whereas overproduction of ketone bodies continues to be the major mechanism for 
maintenance of hyperketonaemia. Insulin deficiency results in increased rates of 
lipolysis and provides increased substrate (free fatty acids) for ketogenesis. 
Hyperglucagonaemia can augment ketogenesis further in the setting of insulin 
deficiency. It is likely that other counter-insulin hormones (growth hormone, 
catecholamines) also contribute to the pathogenesis of DKA, though their role is 
less well defined. Insulin corrects DKA largely via suppression of lipolysis 
(and thus ketone body production); insulin suppresses glucose production at 
lower levels than it does ketone body production.
