Labyrinthitis ossificans (LO) is a rare pathological ossification of the 
membranous labyrinth, typically arising after inflammatory or infectious insults 
to the inner ear. We present a case of a 65-year-old male with type 2 diabetes 
presenting with progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and a history 
of recurrent childhood ear infections treated with repeated lavages. Imaging 
revealed advanced ossification of the right cochlea, vestibule, and semicircular 
canals, despite no history of meningitis or trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) revealed near-complete loss of the normal fluid signal in the affected 
labyrinth, while high-resolution CT confirmed extensive bony obliteration with a 
small residual segment of the basal turn spared. The absence of vestibular 
symptoms despite semicircular canal ossification highlights the variable 
clinical presentation of LO. This case illustrates how advanced LO can closely 
mimic congenital inner ear malformations on imaging, making accurate diagnosis 
particularly challenging. Differential diagnoses such as cochlear otosclerosis, 
temporal bone fractures, and autoimmune inner ear disease must be carefully 
excluded based on clinical and radiological features. Treatment options depend 
on the ossification stage; while cochlear implantation remains feasible in early 
or partial ossification, advanced cases may require alternative rehabilitation 
strategies. Early diagnosis is crucial for optimizing hearing outcomes. This 
report emphasizes the importance of combining clinical history, audiometry, and 
multimodal imaging in the diagnosis and management of LO.
