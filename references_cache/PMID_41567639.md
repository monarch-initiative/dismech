BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of 
cancer-associated deaths worldwide with an estimated of 900,000 new cases 
annually. HCC typically arises in patients with chronic liver disease, including 
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Identifying of the 
main driver genetic alterations in oncogenic genes is essential for 
understanding HCC pathogenesis and defining prognostic biomarkers in high-risk 
patients. This study aimed to identify both germline and somatic mutations 
associated with HCC in a Tunisian patient's cohort.
METHODS: Forty HCC patients with different etiologies were included in this 
study. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 24 patients with 
advanced-stage HCC. Paired tumor and adjacent non-tumoral liver tissue samples 
were obtained from 16 early-stage HCC patients undergoing hepatic resection, 
including 10 fresh-frozen samples and 6 FFPE samples. DNA was extracted using 
the MagCore® Plus II system. Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed 
using the Illumina AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2.
RESULTS: A total of 35 germline mutations were identified across 25 genes. 
Recurrently altered genes included FGFR3 (100%), PDGFRA (100%), RET (98%), APC 
(92%), TP53 (88%), and EGFR (75%). In addition, 14 somatic mutations were 
detected in 13 genes, with frequent alterations observed in APC (100%), ALK 
(94%), HNF1A (56%), CDKN2A (50%), and HRAS (50%).
CONCLUSION: This study offers the first comprehensive overview of novel germline 
and somatic mutations in Tunisian HCC patients, representing a North African 
cohort, and highlights key molecular drivers of hepatocarcinogenesis. These 
findings support the integration of genetic profiling into clinical practice to 
enhance early diagnosis and guide personalized therapies.
