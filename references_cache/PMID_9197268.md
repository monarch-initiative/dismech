Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a lifetime 
incidence of approximately 2 percent. A pattern of familial aggregation has been 
documented for the disorder, and it was recently reported that a PD 
susceptibility gene in a large Italian kindred is located on the long arm of 
human chromosome 4. A mutation was identified in the alpha-synuclein gene, which 
codes for a presynaptic protein thought to be involved in neuronal plasticity, 
in the Italian kindred and in three unrelated families of Greek origin with 
autosomal dominant inheritance for the PD phenotype. This finding of a specific 
molecular alteration associated with PD will facilitate the detailed 
understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder.
