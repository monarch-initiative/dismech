PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The mechanisms implicated in the clinical manifestations of 
zonular diseases, especially ectopia lentis, are reviewed.
RECENT FINDINGS: The molecular mechanisms involve fibrillin in a large spectrum 
of heritable diseases characterized by zonular stretching. The usual 
complications are refractive errors, especially myopia, glaucoma (either primary 
open angle, secondary angle closure and pupil block by anterior displacement of 
the lens) and retinal detachment.
SUMMARY: The genetics and molecular understanding provide information for 
genetic counseling. Treatment of myopia and glaucoma depend on the underlying 
mechanism, and lens surgery techniques are continuously improved.
