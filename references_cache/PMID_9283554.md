BACKGROUND: The sentinel lymph node is the first node or nodes to drain a 
cutaneous melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed to determine whether 
regional metastases are present. The authors' experience with the new technique 
of sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma of the head and neck is reported.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the period of January of 1992 to December of 1995, 
58 consecutive patients were identified from the melanoma database who had 
localization of the sentinel lymph node for primary cutaneous melanoma of the 
head and neck. Techniques for identification of the sentinel node(s) include 
preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative Lymphazurin dye (vital blue 
dye) and technetium-99m-labeled sulfur colloid injection around the primary 
tumor site with Neoprobe mapping.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (13 female, 45 male), mean age 61 years, with 
melanoma of the head and neck with a mean Breslow thickness of 2.21 mm. (range, 
0.82-6.87 mm.) and no regional lymphadenopathy underwent sentinel node mapping. 
The sentinel node was successfully identified in 55 patients (95 percent). Blue 
dye was visualized in 85 of 126 sentinel nodes excised (67 percent), whereas the 
remainder of the sentinel nodes were localized with the Neoprobe. Forty-nine 
patients who had successful mapping and sentinel node biopsy had no evidence of 
metastatic disease in the sentinel node or other nodes in the basin. Six of the 
fifty-five patients (11 percent) had evidence of micrometastatic disease, and 
all six had the sentinel node as the only site of metastasis. Five of six 
patients with micrometastases had a subsequent neck dissection and/or 
superficial parotidectomy. None of these patients had evidence of "skip 
metastases" with a negative sentinel node and higher level nodes positive for 
metastases. In total, 6 of the 18 sentinel nodes (33 percent) identified in 
these six patients contained micrometastatic disease, whereas none of the 139 
other nodes sampled had any evidence of metastases. The exact probability that 
all six unpaired observations would consist of involvement of only the sentinel 
nodes is p = 0.0312.
CONCLUSIONS: By combining the two mapping techniques in patients with melanoma 
of the head and neck, the sentinel node(s) can be mapped and identified 
individually, similar to melanoma in other locations. The sentinel nodes have 
been shown to contain the first evidence of regional metastatic melanoma. This 
staging information can be used to plan therapeutic node dissections and 
adjuvant therapy that may have a survival benefit in patients with stage III 
melanoma of the head and neck. Lymphatic mapping can be used to make the 
surgical care of the melanoma patient more conservative, so that only those 
patients with solid evidence of regional node metastases are subjected to the 
morbidity and expense of a complete node dissection and the toxicities of 
adjuvant therapy.
