Persistent liver injury halts the regenerative capacity of hepatocytes and 
activates mechanisms that result in the replacement of normal hepatic parenchyma 
with extracellular matrix deposits. As liver fibrosis develops, the liver 
undergoes architectural changes and alterations in microcirculation that lead to 
increased intrahepatic vascular resistance and portal hypertension. 
Thrombocytopenia is a prevalent condition in patients with chronic liver disease 
and portal hypertension. Multiple mechanisms related to increased platelet 
destruction or decreased platelet production contribute to thrombocytopenia. 
Increased platelet destruction occurs due to splenic sequestration caused by 
hypersplenism or immune-mediated conditions. Decreased platelet production 
results from a decline in thrombopoietin production, bone marrow suppression by 
medications, or toxic insults. Therapies aimed at improving thrombocytopenia are 
controversial, and individual factors must be considered. Although hepatic 
venous pressure gradient measurement is the gold standard for diagnosing portal 
hypertension, non-invasive tests show adequate correlation with hepatic venous 
pressure gradients. Various clinical risk scores consider platelet counts as 
independent predictors of adverse liver outcomes, such as the development of 
esophageal varices and the presence of advanced fibrosis. Nonselective 
beta-blockers are the cornerstone of long-term management for clinically 
significant portal hypertension. Indications for transjugular intrahepatic 
portosystemic shunt placement include failure to control portal 
hypertension-related bleeding, early rebleeding, and refractory or recurrent 
ascites. Ultimately, liver transplantation is the only definitive cure for 
portal hypertension and its major complications, including thrombocytopenia. 
Understanding the mechanisms underlying thrombocytopenia in patients with portal 
hypertension and chronic liver disease is essential for accurate diagnosis and 
effective patient management. This review aimed to evidence on the 
pathophysiological mechanisms linking chronic liver disease, portal 
hypertension, and thrombocytopenia, and to discuss their diagnostic and 
therapeutic implications.
