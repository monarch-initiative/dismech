The correlation between portal vein pressure (PVP) and flow (PVF) has not been 
established, and there is still lack of consensus about the optimal hemodynamics 
during liver transplantation (LT). We aimed to establish the correlation between 
systemic and hepatic hemodynamics during LT by applying the hepatokinetic power 
hypothesis, based on the law of energy conservation and hydrodynamics.A total of 
103 adult liver transplant recipients were enrolled in this study from September 
2012 to December 2014. Systemic and hepatic hemodynamics were assessed 
intraoperatively to calculate the hepatokinetic power status. Severe surgical 
complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III) were recorded as the main outcome 
measure, and potential covariates were evaluated including recipient, donor, 
donor-recipient match, surgery-related factors, conventional hemodynamics, and 
the intraoperative hepatokinetic power profile.In multivariate analysis, 
hepatokinetic power gradient >4260 mL mmHg min100 g graft weight (P = 0.001), 
2.2 < ratio of hepatokinetic power from the portal vein to the hepatic artery 
≤8.7 (P = 0.012), and hepatic resistance of partial grafts ≤0.006 or >0.015 min 
mmHg mL (P = 0.012) were associated with a higher risk. None of the conventional 
hemodynamic parameters, such as PVP, PVF, and hepatic venous pressure gradient, 
entered into this regression model (c-statistic = 0.916) when competing with 
hepatokinetic power indexes.The hepatokinetic power hypothesis clarifies the 
correlation of systemic and hepatic hemodynamics in a simple, rational manner. 
The hepatic resistance, derived from the hepatokinetic power equation, can be 
quantified and has an effect on the incidence of severe surgical complications. 
This finding offers a new objective clinical approach to evaluate graft quality 
during transplantation.
