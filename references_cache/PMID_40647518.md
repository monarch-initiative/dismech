Background: Gastric neoplasms remain pathologies of the malignant spectrum with 
high incidence and prevalence, with their management requiring a precise 
histopathological characterization for optimal treatment planning. Methods: The 
present study is a retrospective analysis that included 67 histopathologically 
confirmed gastric neoplasia subjects and was performed at a single surgical 
center from January 2020 to December 2021. Demographics, tumor characteristics, 
surgical procedures, and oncologic outcomes were included, filtered, and 
subsequently analyzed using SPSS Statistics 29.0. Results: This study involved 
67 patients (mean age 65.7 years, 56.7% men), with adenocarcinoma being the most 
common histologic type (91.0%) and most tumors being diagnosed directly as Stage 
III (40.3%). Lauren classification revealed the intestinal type as the most 
common (49.2%), followed by diffuse (36.1%) and mixed (14.8%). Poorly 
differentiated tumors (G3) accounted for 53.7% of cases. The surgical team 
performed curative resection in 75% (n = 50) of patients, achieving R0 margins 
in 88% of these cases. Subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy yielded the 
highest curative success rate with 96.6% R0 resection. Statistically, we 
identified two significant correlations between age and tumor grade (rho = 0.28; 
p = 0.021) and between the number of lymph nodes examined and the number of 
lymph nodes invaded (rho = 0.65, p < 0.001). This study again revealed that 
adenocarcinomas showed higher rates of lymph node invasion than other tumor 
types (p = 0.017). Conclusions: The analysis of patients with gastric neoplasms 
is vital for appropriate therapeutic management. Even though the study period 
included a pandemic, the analysis remained a complex one with high-quality 
surgical outcomes, confirming the importance of maintaining oncologic standards 
during medical crises.
