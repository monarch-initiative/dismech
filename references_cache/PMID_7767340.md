Recent studies have suggested an association between primary antiphospholipid 
syndrome (PAPS), antiphospholipid antibodies and some major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) antigens. We have studied the relationship between MHC class II 
antigens and PAPS in 19 patients from the south of Spain. Univariant analysis 
showed an association between PAPS and HLA-DQ7 (47% vs 25%l P = 0.3), DR4 (32% 
vs 16%; P = 0.08) and DQ3 (63% vs 39%; P = 0.04). However, multivariant analysis 
confirmed the association with DQ7 (RR = 2.5; CI 80%: 1.3-4.7) and DR4 (RR = 
2.2; CI 80%: 1.1-4.4) but not with DQ3. When we introduced DRw53 into this 
analysis, we noticed a DR4 confounding effect, with DQ7 (RR = 3.1; CI 80%: 
1.7-5.8) and Drw53 (RR = 2.3; CI 80%: 1.2-4.4) remaining as the most important 
HLA antigens related to PAPS. In conclusion, in PAPS patients from the South of 
Spain, HLA-DQ7 antigen showed the highest relative risk for PAPS, followed by 
DRw53.
