BACKGROUND: The MenAfriNet Consortium supports strategic implementation of 
case-based meningitis surveillance in key high-risk countries of the African 
meningitis belt: Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger, and Togo. We describe 
bacterial meningitis epidemiology in these 5 countries in 2015-2017.
METHODS: Case-based meningitis surveillance collects case-level demographic and 
clinical information and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) laboratory results. Neisseria 
meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae cases were 
confirmed and N. meningitidis/H. influenzae were serogrouped/serotyped by 
real-time polymerase chain reaction, culture, or latex agglutination. We 
calculated annual incidence in participating districts in each country in 
cases/100 000 population.
RESULTS: From 2015-2017, 18 262 suspected meningitis cases were reported; 92% 
had a CSF specimen available, of which 26% were confirmed as N. meningitidis (n 
= 2433; 56%), S. pneumoniae (n = 1758; 40%), or H. influenzae (n = 180; 4%). 
Average annual incidences for N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae, 
respectively, were 7.5, 2.5, and 0.3. N. meningitidis incidence was 1.5 in 
Burkina Faso, 2.7 in Chad, 0.4 in Mali, 14.7 in Niger, and 12.5 in Togo. Several 
outbreaks occurred: NmC in Niger in 2015-2017, NmC in Mali in 2016, and NmW in 
Togo in 2016-2017. Of N. meningitidis cases, 53% were NmC, 30% NmW, and 13% NmX. 
Five NmA cases were reported (Burkina Faso, 2015). NmX increased from 0.6% of N. 
meningitidis cases in 2015 to 27% in 2017.
CONCLUSIONS: Although bacterial meningitis epidemiology varied widely by 
country, NmC and NmW caused several outbreaks, NmX increased although was not 
associated with outbreaks, and overall NmA incidence remained low. An effective 
low-cost multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine could help further control 
meningococcal meningitis in the region.
