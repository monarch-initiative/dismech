This is a case report of a gastrointestinal infection caused by Dientamoeba 
fragilis. It is a flagellate protozoan that is an uncommon etiology of 
gastrointestinal disease. Primarily characterized by diarrhea and abdominal 
pain, other symptoms such as flatulence, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, and 
weight loss occur. Diagnosis is made using multiple fresh stool samples that are 
preserved and permanently stained looking for the typical binucleate 
trophozoite. Since there is a distinct association with Enterobius vermicularis 
(possibly the mode of protozoan transmission), the human pinworm is also sought. 
Treatment of choice consists of diiodohydroxyquin in adults and metronidazole in 
children.
