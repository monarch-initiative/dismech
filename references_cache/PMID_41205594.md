Long COVID (LC) manifests with sex-specific differences, particularly in those 
with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Our study 
reveals that female LC patients (LCF) with ME/CFS show a shift toward 
myelopoiesis, reduced lymphocytes, increased neutrophils/monocytes, and depleted 
regulatory T cells-suggesting persistent immune activation. Elevated CD71+ 
erythroid cells and disrupted erythropoiesis contribute to fatigue and tissue 
damage in LCF. Cytokine profiling indicates a stronger pro-inflammatory response 
in LCF compared to males (LCM), along with markers of gut barrier dysfunction. 
Hormonal analysis shows reduced testosterone in LCF and estradiol in LCM. 
Transcriptomic data reveal neuroinflammatory signatures in LCF, potentially 
explaining cognitive symptoms. We also identify biomarkers that distinguish LCF 
from LCM and correlate with sex-specific clinical symptoms. Overall, LC with 
ME/CFS is characterized by sex-specific immune, hormonal, and transcriptional 
alterations, with females exhibiting more severe inflammation. These insights 
underscore the need for sex-tailored interventions, including consideration of 
hormone replacement therapy.
