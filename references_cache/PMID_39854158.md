Post-acute coronavirus disease 2019 syndrome (PACS), following severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19), is typically characterized by long-term debilitating symptoms 
affecting multiple organs and systems. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack 
of effective treatment strategies. Altered gut microbiome has been proposed as 
one of the plausible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of PACS; extensive 
studies have emerged to bridge the gap between the persistent symptoms and the 
dysbiosis of gut microbiome. Recent clinical trials have indicated that gut 
microbiome modulation using probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) led to improvements in multiple symptoms related to PACS, 
including fatigue, memory loss, difficulty in concentration, gastrointestinal 
upset, and disturbances in sleep and mood. In this review, we highlight the 
latest evidence on the key microbial alterations observed in PACS, as well as 
the use of microbiome-based therapeutics in managing PACS symptoms. These novel 
findings altogether shed light on the treatment of PACS and other chronic 
conditions.
