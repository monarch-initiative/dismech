Thyroid function in Addison's disease.

Maisey MN, Lessof MH.

Clinical evidence of a thyroid disorder was present in 10 out of 40 patients 
with Addison's disease. Though the remaining 30 patients had no clinical 
evidence of thyroid disease, six (out of 15 tested) had thyroid microsomal 
antibodies and a considerably impaired response to thyrotrophin. These changes 
are interpreted as very early indications of developing thyroid failure. When 
circulating microsomal antibodies are found this seems to indicate the presence 
of established thyroid disease.
