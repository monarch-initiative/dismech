The protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) R620W polymorphism has 
been related to susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) with 
inconsistent results. Therefore, this meta-analysis was designed to assess a 
more accurate association between the PTPN22 R620W polymorphism and AITD 
susceptibility. A systematic search of the EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CBM, 
CNKI, and WanFang databases was performed to determine relevant publications. 
Statistical analyses of the odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), 
and p values were performed using STATA software. Our meta-analysis included 18 
separate studies comprised of 4,726 cases and 4,220 controls. In the allele and 
all genetic models, PTPN22 R620W polymorphism and Graves' disease (GD) (allele 
model TvsC: OR = 1.573; 95% CI = 1.378-1.795; P < .001) and Hashimoto's 
thyroiditis (HT) (allele model TvsC: OR = 1.737; 95% CI = 1.230-2.454; P = .002) 
susceptibility was positively associated. A racial subgroup analysis showed that 
the T allele significantly increased AITD susceptibility in all genetic models 
involving Caucasians, but not in Asians. This meta-analysis showed that the 
PTPN22 R620W polymorphism is associated with the risk of GD and HT in the 
overall study population. In addition, the PTPN22 R620W polymorphism is 
associated with elevated AITD risk in Caucasians, but not in Asians.
