## Content

Autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases affecting the inner ear can cause symptoms such as hearing loss, imbalance, vertigo, and tinnitus, presenting demanding and often underdiagnosed conditions. Diagnostic challenges arise due to their diverse manifestations, potential long-term consequences, and the absence of specific serological markers, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach combining clinical evaluation, audiological assessments, and imaging techniques. Various autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren’s syndrome, have been implicated in immune-mediated damage to auditory structures, resulting in inner ear dysfunction. Inflammatory processes in autoinflammatory diseases like Cogan’s syndrome and relapsing polychondritis can also affect the inner ear. While the exact mechanisms of inner ear involvement in these conditions are still being studied, immune-mediated inflammation, damage to auditory structures, and vascular involvement play significant roles in auditory impairments. Treatment strategies primarily focus on immunomodulation and inflammation control using corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and targeted biologic agents to ameliorate symptoms and preserve hearing function. Hearing aids and cochlear implants may be also considered for severe hearing loss. Individualized approaches are necessary due to patient response heterogeneity. This review provides a concise overview of key autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases impacting the inner ear, highlighting clinical manifestations, diagnostics, pathophysiology, and treatment options. Early recognition and appropriate management are crucial for optimizing patient outcomes. Further research is needed to understand underlying mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. Collaboration between otolaryngologists, rheumatologists, and immunologists is crucial for improving the quality of life in these complex conditions.
