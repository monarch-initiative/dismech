IMPORTANCE: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignancy, with an estimated 
434 840 incident cases worldwide in 2022. In the US, it is the sixth most common 
cancer among males and ninth among females.
OBSERVATIONS: Clear cell RCC is the most common histologic subtype (75%-80% of 
cases) and is characterized by inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor 
suppressor gene. Many patients (37%-61%) are diagnosed with RCC incidentally on 
an abdominal imaging study such as ultrasound or computed tomographic scan, and 
70% of patients have stage I RCC at diagnosis. Although its incidence has 
increased approximately 1% per year from 2015 through 2019, the mortality rate 
of RCC has declined about 2% per year in the US from 2016 through 2020. Patients 
with a solid renal mass or complex cystic renal mass should be referred to 
urology. Treatment options for RCC confined to the kidney include surgical 
resection with partial or radical nephrectomy, ablative techniques (eg, 
cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, radiation), or active surveillance for 
some patients (especially those with renal masses <2 cm). For patients with 
renal masses less than 4 cm in size (48% of patients), partial nephrectomy can 
result in a 5-year cancer-specific survival of more than 94%. For advanced or 
metastatic RCC, combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors or the combination 
of immune checkpoint inhibitors with tyrosine kinase inhibitors are associated 
with tumor response of 42% to 71%, with a median overall survival of 46 to 56 
months.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: RCC is a common malignancy that is often diagnosed 
incidentally on an abdominal imaging study. Seventy percent of patients are 
diagnosed with stage I RCC and 11% of patients with stage IV. First-line 
treatments for early-stage RCC are partial or radical nephrectomy, which can 
result in 5-year cancer-specific survival of more than 94%, ablative techniques, 
or active surveillance. New treatment options for patients with metastatic RCC 
include immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
