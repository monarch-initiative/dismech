BACKGROUND: Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm, 
characterized by trilineage hypercellularity, which increases the risk of 
thrombosis. Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a very rare autoimmune neuronal 
excitability disorder, in which antibodies disrupt the balance between 
excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, leading to stiffness and spasms of 
agonist and antagonist muscles.
CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes the first known case of PV and SPS 
occurring simultaneously in a middle-aged male patient. He presented with back 
stiffness and painful abdominal spasms and was found to have erythrocytosis 
incidentally. He had high JAK2 V617F mutation burden and was positive for 
anti-GAD65 antibody. Progressively intensified therapy was given until his 
symptoms resolved.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of 
these conditions as well as the need for further exploration of potential shared 
molecular mechanisms between PV and SPS.
