Abstract

Background
Whereas the exact aetiology of microscopic colitis [MC] remains unknown, a dysregulated immune response to luminal factors or medications is the most accepted pathogenesis hypothesis.


Methods
We conducted a systematic review of the pathogenesis of MC. We applied the Joanna Briggs Institute methodologies and the PRISMA statement for the reporting of systematic reviews [PROSPERO Trial Identifier: CRD42020145008]. Populations, Exposure of interest, and Outcome [PEO] questions were used to explore the following topics in MC: 1] intestinal luminal factors; 2] autoimmunity; 3] innate immunity; 4] adaptive immunity; 5] extracellular matrix; 6] genetic risk factors; and 7] mechanism of diarrhoea. A search was done in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to February 2020. A narrative description was performed explaining the findings for each aspect of MC aetiopathogenesis.


Results
Thirty-eight documents provided evidence for PEO1, 100 for PEO2, 72 for PEO3 and 4, 38 for PEO5, 20 for PEO6, and 23 for PEO7. The majority of documents were cohorts, case reports, and case series, with a few case-control and some experimental studies. Consistency among data provided by different studies was considered to support pathogenetic hypotheses. MC is a multifactorial disease believed to involve innate and adaptive immune responses to luminal factors, genetic risk, autoimmunity, and extracellular matrix alterations, all contributing by varied mechanisms to watery diarrhoea.


Conclusions
This is the first systematic review on the aetiology of MC supporting the notion that MC is a multifactorial disease. However, high-profile studies are lacking, and most evidence derives from small heterogeneous studies.
