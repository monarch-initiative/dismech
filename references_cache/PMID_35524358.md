Background: Long COVID (coronavirus disease 2019) syndrome includes a group of 
patients who, after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibit lingering mild-to-moderate symptoms and develop medical 
complications that can have lasting health problems. In this report, we propose 
a model for the pathophysiology of the long COVID presentation based on 
increased proinflammatory cytokine production that results from the persistence 
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or one of its molecular components. Associated with this 
hyperproduction of inflammatory cytokines is a heightened activity of nuclear 
factor κ B (NF-κB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways 
that regulate cytokine production. Objective: The purpose of the present report 
was to review the causes of long COVID syndrome and suggest ways that can 
provide a basis for a better understanding of the clinical symptomatology for 
the of improved diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for the condition. 
Methods: Extensive research was conducted in medical literature data bases by 
applying terms such as "long COVID" associated with "persistence of the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus" "spike protein' "COVID-19" and "biologic therapies." Results 
and Conclusions: In this model of the long COVID syndrome, the persistence of 
SARS-CoV-2 is hypothesized to trigger a dysregulated immune system with 
subsequent heightened release of proinflammatory cytokines that lead to chronic 
low-grade inflammation and multiorgan symptomatology. The condition seems to 
have a genetic basis, which predisposes individuals to have a diminished 
immunologic capacity to completely clear the virus, with residual parts of the 
virus persisting. This persistence of virus and resultant hyperproduction of 
proinflammatory cytokines are proposed to form the basis of the syndrome.
