# VRC 614: A Phase 1, Dose Escalation, Open-Label Clinical Trial With Experimental Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) to Evaluate Safety and Protective Efficacy of an Anti-Malaria Human Monoclonal Antibody, VRC-MALMAB0114-00-AB (L9LS), in Healthy Malaria-Naive Adults

## Content

Background:

Malaria is a parasitic disease carried by mosquitoes in tropical areas. There is no vaccine to prevent malaria infection. If not treated right away, it can become serious or deadly. Researchers want to test a drug to prevent malaria.

Objective:

To test if the drug L9LS is safe and if it prevents malaria infection in people.

Eligibility:

Healthy adults ages 18-50 who have never had malaria.

Design:

Participants were screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

Participants were divided into 6 groups:

* Three groups received L9LS by infusion into a vein, and gave blood samples before and after infusion.
* One group received L9LS injected into the fat under the skin.
* One group did not get L9LS.
* One group received L9LS injected into the muscle.

All participants who received L9LS were monitored for side effects. They had 2-3 follow-up visits during the week after the drug was given, and gave blood samples. They received a thermometer to check their temperature daily for 7 days. They received a tool to measure any redness, swelling, or bruising at the injection site.

Most participants took part in the controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) or malaria challenge to find out if L9LS prevents malaria after being bitten by infected mosquitos. Participants in the group who received L9LS injected in the muscle were enrolled after CHMI and did not take part in the CHMI. Participants who received CHMI were bitten by mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasites. A cup containing mosquitoes was placed on their arm for 5 minutes. On days 7-17 after exposure, they received daily study visits to give blood samples. Those who got malaria were treated immediately. On day 21, all CHMI participants received treatment for malaria.

Participation lasted 2-6 months, depending on study group.
