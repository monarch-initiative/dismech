We report on a 25 year old female patient who had a diagnosis of Jeavons 
syndrome since her childhood. Although valproate led to seizure freedom, she 
developed persistent reproductive endocrine disorders attributed to this drug. 
The withdrawal of valproate in parallel with an initiation of levetiracetam 
monotherapy resulted in a maintenance of clinical remission and a resolution of 
these abnormalities. This case together with relevant literature data supports 
the view that the use of levetiracetam might be of benefit for female patients 
with Jeavons syndrome.
