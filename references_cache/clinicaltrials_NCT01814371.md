# Individualized vs. Household Eradication of MRSA in Households With Children

## Content

The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of commonly used decolonization treatments (application of mupirocin antibiotic ointment to the nose and bleach baths) when performed by individuals with a history of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) in the prior year (individualized approach) in comparison to decolonization of all household members (household approach) in an attempt to prevent Staphylococcus aureus skin infections. The investigators hypothesize an individualized decolonization approach will be equally as effective as a household approach to prevent SSTI.
