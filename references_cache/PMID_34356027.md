The subject of this review is alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD), which is a 
rare hereditary disease with great impact in adults, especially smokers, quality 
of life and longevity. Early diagnosis is crucial for treatment outcome. The 
primary care physician should refer patients younger than 50-years-old with COPD 
or emphysema, familiar accumulation of A1AD or liver cirrhosis of unknown cause. 
Most important treatment is smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation and 
inhaled medication according to current guidelines. Substitution treatment with 
alpha-1-antitrypsin is now an option after its approval by the Danish medical 
council in January 2020.
