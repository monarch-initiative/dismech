Arnold Pick (1851-1924) provided the first description of the neurodegenerative 
disease associated with his name; but his importance to the field of 
neuroscience goes far beyond this eponymous gift. His view that the process of 
dementia should be seen as a mosaic of circumscribed neuropsychological deficits 
and not as a diffuse degradation of mental abilities is essential for progress 
in a cognitive neuropsychological approach to the study of dementias.
