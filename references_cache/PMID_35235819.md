Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) results in symptoms of heart failure, atrial and 
ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and profound autonomic 
dysfunction. These symptoms present unique management challenges as compared 
with patients without CA, and can be very debilitating. Thus, management of the 
cardiovascular symptoms of these patients plays a central role in their care. 
This review presents an overview of the typical cardiovascular manifestations 
encountered in patients with CA and highlights the key management considerations 
for each.
