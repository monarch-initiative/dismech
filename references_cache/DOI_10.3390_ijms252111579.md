## Content

Fibroblasts, the principal cellular mediators of connective tissue remodeling, play a crucial role in the formation of physiological and pathological scars. Understanding the intricate interplay between fibroblasts and other cellular and molecular components is essential for elucidating the underlying mechanisms driving scar formation. Hypertrophic scars, keloids and atrophic scars arise from dysregulated wound healing processes characterized by persistent inflammation, aberrant collagen deposition, and impaired extracellular matrix remodeling. Fibroblasts play a central role in the pathogenesis of such pathological scars, driving aberrant extracellular matrix remodeling, subsequently contributing to the formation of raised or depressed fibrotic lesions. The investigation of complex interactions between fibroblasts and the microenvironment is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating fibroblast activity and improving clinical outcomes in patients with pathological scars. Further research into the molecular pathways governing fibroblast behavior and their heterogeneity holds promise for advancing scar management strategies. This narrative review was performed to shed light on the mechanisms behind scar formation, with a special focus on the role of fibroblasts in the formation of different types of scars, providing insights into the pathophysiology of these conditions. Through the analysis of current knowledge, this review seeks to identify the key cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in fibroblast activation, collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling in hypertrophic scar, keloid, or atrophic scar formation.
