Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways interacting with 
altered structure and function of the formed elements including smooth muscle. 
While atopy and polarization of the airway T-cell response toward a Th-2 
phenotype are important factors in asthma pathogenesis, there is increasing 
realization that remodeling events are also important. Evidence is presented 
that inflammation and altered airway structure in asthma interact through the 
epithelium and underlying mesenchyme. As in other chronic inflammatory 
disorders, a dynamic interplay between mediators, cytokines, and growth factors 
provides a broader base on which to identify novel preventative and therapeutic 
strategies in asthma.
