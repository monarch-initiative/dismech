## Content

Polymerase I (Pol I) is at the epicenter of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. Pol I is a target for the treatment of cancer. Given the many cellular commonalities between cancer and neurodegeneration (i.e., different faces of the same coin), it seems rational to consider targeting Pol I or, more generally, rRNA synthesis for the treatment of disorders associated with the death of terminally differentiated neurons. Principally, ribosomes synthesize proteins, and, accordingly, Pol I can be considered the starting point for protein synthesis. Given that cellular accumulation of abnormal proteins such as α-synuclein and tau is an essential feature of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease and fronto-temporal dementia, reduction of protein production is now considered a viable target for treatment of these and closely related neurodegenerative disorders. Abnormalities in polymerase I activity and rRNA production may also be associated with nuclear and nucleolar stress, DNA damage, and childhood-onset neuronal death, as is the case for the UBTF E210K neuroregression syndrome. Moreover, restraining the activity of Pol I may be a viable strategy to slow aging. Before starting down the road of Pol I inhibition for treating non-cancerous disorders of the nervous system, many questions must be answered. First, how much Pol I inhibition can neurons tolerate, and for how long? Should inhibition of Pol I be continuous or pulsed? Will cells compensate for Pol I inhibition by upregulating the number of active rDNAs? At present, we have no effective and safe disease modulatory treatments for Alzheimer disease, α-synucleinopathies, or tauopathies, and novel therapeutic targets and approaches must be explored.
