Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) accounts for ~9-10% of 
gastric cancers worldwide and is defined by a distinctive molecular profile, 
including extreme hypermethylation of the DNA. Targeting this aberrant 
methylation may be a potential therapeutic strategy. EBV+ gastric cancer cell 
lines (YCCEL1, SNU719) and EBV- lines (AGS, SNU16, MKN74) were treated with a 
DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor (DNMT), decitabine (DCB), for three days 
followed by RNA sequencing to identify EBV-specific responses. DNA methylation 
profiling by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed in 
EBV+ cell-lines and integrated with expression data to identify epigenetically 
regulated networks. While DCB induced broad transcriptional changes across all 
lines, EBV+ cells exhibited the strongest transcriptional response, sharing many 
upregulated genes. Many of these EBV+ specific genes were expressed at lower 
baseline levels in EBV+ tumors from TCGA. DCB predominantly reduced methylation 
at highly methylated intergenic CpGs, with a subset of promoters undergoing 
significant demethylation. Integrated analysis revealed a strong inverse 
correlation between promoter demethylation and gene expression, implicating 
multiple cancer-relevant pathways. Upstream regulator analysis and motif 
enrichment indicated that regions losing methylation were enriched for retinoic 
acid receptor α (RARα) binding motifs, suggesting that DCB-mediated 
demethylation restores RA pathway accessibility and transcriptional activity. 
Further, inhibiting RAR signaling reduced DCB induced apoptosis. Although DCB 
can induce both host gene re-expression and viral lytic gene activation in 
EBV-positive tumors, its impact on RA signaling in EBVaGC has not been studied. 
Decitabine promotes extensive epigenetic reprogramming in EBVaGC, with 
preferential effects in CIMP-positive, EBV-infected cell lines.
