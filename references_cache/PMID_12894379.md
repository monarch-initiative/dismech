In recent years, the usefulness of interferon beta and glatiramer acetate in the 
treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) has been established. 
Interferon beta has also been shown to be efficacious in secondary-progressive 
multiple sclerosis (SPMS) as well as in patients with isolated syndromes at risk 
to develop clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS). Mitoxantrone is another 
disease-modifying drug that is available for SPMS and severe cases of RRMS. The 
clinical utility of disease-modifying agents in MS will be reviewed with respect 
to the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and immunosuppressive treatments 
that are currently available. Symptomatic therapies will not be considered.
