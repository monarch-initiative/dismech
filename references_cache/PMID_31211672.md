We investigated dengue virus (DENV) and asymptomatic DENV infections in rural 
villages of Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia, during 2012 and 2013. We conducted 
perifocal investigations in and around households for 149 DENV index cases 
identified through hospital and village surveillance. We tested participants 
0.5-30 years of age by using nonstructural 1 rapid tests and confirmed DENV 
infections using quantitative reverse transcription PCR or nonstructural 
1-capture ELISA. We used multivariable Poisson regressions to explore links 
between participants' DENV infection status and household characteristics. Of 
7,960 study participants, 346 (4.4%) were infected with DENV, among whom 302 
(87.3%) were <15 years of age and 225 (65.0%) were <9 years of age. We 
identified 26 (7.5%) participants with strictly asymptomatic DENV infection at 
diagnosis and during follow-up. We linked symptomatic DENV infection status to 
familial relationships with index cases. During the 2-year study, we saw fewer 
asymptomatic DENV infections than expected based on the literature.
