Biological monoclonal antibody drugs inhibit overactive cytokine signalling that 
drives chronic inflammatory disease in different organ systems. In the last 10 
years, interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors have attained an important position in the 
treatment of psoriatic skin and joint disease as well as inflammatory bowel 
diseases. Addressing an upstream pathological mechanism shared between these 
disorders, this drug class has high efficacy rates and a durable response that 
extends dosing intervals up to 3 months. Pooled clinical trial data show 
objective disease improvement for more than 70% of patients with psoriasis and 
up to 50% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The first antibody 
inhibitor for IL-23A targeted a p40 subunit shared with IL-12. Subsequently, 
even greater improvement was established for inhibitors of the p19 protein 
unique to IL-23A. IL-23 p19 inhibitors elicit clinical response in both 
bio-naive and bio-exposed patients and show superiority to tumour necrosis 
factor α inhibitors in plaque psoriasis. Reported differences in efficacy 
between p19 inhibitors suggest that individual drug action might be modulated by 
antibody affinity. Although long-term safety data are accumulating, rates of 
serious adverse events and infections for interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors are 
similar to the rates for placebo across approved indications.
