Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), also known as neurodermatitis, is a common 
chronic pruritic dermatosis defined by lichenified plaques resulting from 
persistent scratching. Though often secondary to underlying dermatologic, 
systemic, or psychological triggers, LSC represents a distinct clinical entity 
with significant morbidity. The hallmark itch-scratch cycle contributes not only 
to visible skin changes but also to substantial sleep disruption, emotional 
distress, and functional impairment. Psychological stress, anxiety, and 
depression are frequent comorbidities and can further perpetuate disease 
chronicity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evolving 
understanding of LSC, from its neuroimmune-driven pathogenesis to the wide 
spectrum of therapeutic strategies currently available. In addition to topical 
corticosteroids, novel approaches including immunomodulators, neuromodulators, 
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and biologics are being increasingly explored. 
Procedural therapies such as cryotherapy, fractional laser resurfacing, and 
botulinum toxin injections, have also emerged as valuable tools, particularly in 
treatment-refractory cases. Recent insights into type 2 inflammation and 
dysregulated sensory pathways have informed the rationale for these targeted 
strategies. In anatomically sensitive areas such as the genital region, where 
topical agents may be poorly tolerated, systemic treatments may be required. 
Given this complexity, individualized, multimodal treatment plans are critical 
to optimizing management and improving quality of life (QoL) in patients with 
LSC. By synthesizing current data on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and both 
established and emerging therapies, this review aims to guide clinicians in 
optimizing care for patients with LSC and addressing its far-reaching 
psychosocial burden.
