Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause chronic, lifelong infection of the liver 
that may lead to persistent or episodic immune-mediated inflammation against 
virus-infected hepatocytes. This immune response results in elevated rates of 
killing of virus-infected hepatocytes, which may extend over many years or 
decades, lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis, and play a role in the high incidence 
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HBV carriers. Immune-mediated inflammation 
appears to cause oxidative DNA damage to hepatocytes, which may also play a 
major role in hepatocarcinogenesis. An additional DNA damaging feature of 
chronic infections is random integration of HBV DNA into the chromosomal DNA of 
hepatocytes. While HBV DNA integration does not have a role in virus replication 
it may alter gene expression of the host cell. Indeed, most HCCs that arise in 
HBV carriers contain integrated HBV DNA and, in many, the integrant appears to 
have played a role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Clonal expansion of hepatocytes, 
which is a natural feature of liver biology, occurs because the hepatocyte 
population is self-renewing and therefore loses complexity due to random 
hepatocyte death and replacement by proliferation of surviving hepatocytes. This 
process may also represent a risk factor for the development of HCC. 
Interestingly, during chronic HBV infection, hepatocyte clones detected using 
integrated HBV DNA as lineage-specific markers, emerge that are larger than 
those expected to occur by random death and proliferation of hepatocytes. The 
emergence of these larger hepatocyte clones may reflect a survival advantage 
that could be explained by an ability to avoid the host immune response. While 
most of these larger hepatocyte clones are probably not preneoplastic, some may 
have already acquired preneoplastic changes. Thus, chronic inflammation in the 
HBV-infected liver may be responsible, at least in part, for both initiation of 
HCC via oxidative DNA damage and promotion of HCC via stimulation of hepatocyte 
proliferation through immune-mediated killing and compensatory division.
