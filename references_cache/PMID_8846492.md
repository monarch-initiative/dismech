A hospital-based survey was undertaken to investigate the relationship between 
the incidence and severity of malaria infection and various red cell disorders 
in Myanmar. The mean parasitaemia levels of patients with alpha- or 
beta-thalassaemia trait or with severe glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
deficiency were lower than those of individuals with normal haemoglobin AA or 
with heterozygous haemoglobin E. The double genetic defect of thalassaemia trait 
and severe G6PD deficiency appeared to confer some degree of protection against 
malaria.
