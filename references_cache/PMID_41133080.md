Lyme disease (LD), caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is a 
multisystemic zoonosis that can progress to severe autoimmune manifestations in 
its advanced stages. This article describes the case of a Brazilian patient who 
developed acquired epidermolysis bullosa (EBA) following an LD diagnosis. 
Initially, the patient presented with atypical erythema migrans, which later 
evolved into multiple bullous lesions characterized by cycles of exacerbation 
and remission. Histopathological investigation revealed subepidermal cleavage 
with linear IgG deposits along the basement membrane, confirming the diagnosis 
of EBA. Treatment consisted of doxycycline and dapsone for 90 days, leading to 
regression of the lesions, normalization of inflammatory markers, and 
significant clinical improvement. After completing antibiotic therapy, 
immunomodulation with colchicine and hydroxychloroquine was initiated to control 
the autoimmune response. This case highlights the immune-mediated impact of LD, 
where autoantibodies, such as anti-collagen VII, can play a central role in 
perpetuating symptoms. These findings emphasize the importance of a personalized 
diagnostic and therapeutic approach, incorporating both antibiotics and 
immunomodulators, to manage LD-associated autoimmune complications. The 
complexity of the disease underscores the necessity of multidisciplinary care 
and integrated interventions to minimize sequelae and improve the quality of 
life for affected patients.
