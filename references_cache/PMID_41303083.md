Background: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a rare contiguous gene deletion 
disorder associated with a high incidence of early-onset epilepsy. Despite the 
clinical relevance of seizures in this population, few large-scale studies have 
provided detailed data on epilepsy phenotypes and treatment outcomes. Methods: 
We analyzed a cohort of 140 individuals with WHS from Spain and Latin America. 
Using validated caregiver-reported questionnaires, we collected detailed 
information on seizure types, antiseizure medications (ASM) use, and associated 
comorbidities. Statistical comparisons were made to identify correlations 
between epilepsy severity, deletion size, and functional outcomes. Results: 
Epilepsy was observed in 92% of patients, typically beginning before 12 months 
of age. Multiple seizure types were common, particularly generalized 
tonic-clonic and atypical absence seizures. Status epilepticus occurred in 58% 
of cases, with a high proportion requiring multiple ASMs. Valproic acid and 
levetiracetam were the most commonly used treatments. Patients with more severe 
epilepsy tended to have larger deletions (>9 Mb) and poorer developmental 
outcomes. ASM discontinuation was significantly associated with older age at 
evaluation, supporting improved seizure control over time. Conclusions: Epilepsy 
in WHS is frequent, often severe in early childhood, and associated with 
neurodevelopmental impairment and increased treatment burden. While some 
patients show improvement with age, early aggressive management using 
appropriate ASMs may be critical to improve neurological prognosis. Advances in 
diagnosis, early intervention, and targeted therapies offer hope for improved 
long-term outcomes in this vulnerable population.
