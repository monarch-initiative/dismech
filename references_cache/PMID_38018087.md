INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal motility disorders are highly prevalent without 
satisfactory treatment. noninvasive electrical neuromodulation is an emerging 
therapy for treating various gastrointestinal motility disorders.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, several emerging noninvasive neuromodulation 
methods are introduced, including transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve 
stimulation, percutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation, transcutaneous 
cervical vagal nerve stimulation, transcutaneous electrical acustimulation, 
transabdominal interference stimulation, tibial nerve stimulation, and 
translumbosacral neuromodulation therapy. Their clinical applications in the 
most common gastrointestinal motility are discussed, including gastroesophageal 
reflux disease, functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, functional constipation, 
irritable bowel syndrome, and fecal incontinence. PubMed database was searched 
from 1995 to June 2023 for relevant articles in English.
EXPERT OPINION: Noninvasive neuromodulation is effective and safe in improving 
both gastrointestinal symptoms and dysmotility; it can be used when 
pharmacotherapy is ineffective. Future directions include refining the 
methodology, improving device development and understanding mechanisms of 
action.
