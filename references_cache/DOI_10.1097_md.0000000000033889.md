## Content

Rationale:
Autoimmune inner ear disease typically presents with bilateral hearing loss that progresses over weeks or months though its mechanisms are unknown. Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment, but their responses are variable and relapses are frequent. Thus, many experts have sought to replace corticosteroids with immunosuppressive agents.


Patient concerns:
A 35-year-old woman experienced a progressive hearing impairment, initially on the left side and later becoming bilateral. Her response to corticosteroid monotherapy was temporary, and there have been two relapse episodes over several months.


Diagnoses:
Autoimmune inner ear disease was considered due to evidence of autoimmunity combined with a clinical course of bilateral and recurrent sensorineural hearing loss and a partial response to corticosteroid therapy.


Interventions:
The patient received a 3-day mini-pulse of methylprednisolone at 250 mg/d, followed by 12 mg/d maintenance, and concurrently began an azathioprine regimen gradually increasing to 100 mg/day as a corticosteroid-sparing agent.


Outcomes:
Three weeks after immunosuppressive therapy, hearing and pure-tone audiometry improved, and after 7 weeks, methylprednisolone was tapered to 8 mg/d. The dosage was further reduced by adding methotrexate at 7.5 mg/week, resulting in a reduction to 4 mg/d as maintenance therapy after 4 weeks.


Lessons:
For patients who are unresponsive to corticosteroids or experience difficulty tolerating them, a combination therapy of methotrexate and azathioprine is recommended as a viable alternative as this regimen is well-tolerated and yields positive outcomes.
