# Upregulation of olfactory receptors and neuronal-associated genes highlights complex immune and neuronal dysregulation in Long COVID patients

## Content

In this study, we isolated RNA from the whole blood of 19 patients who developed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also isolated RNA from the whole blood of 17 healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed the genes that had differential expression between patients with ME/CFS and HCs.
