Exercise-induced asthma.

Gerhard H, Schachter EN.

Exercise-induced asthma can appear as one of many forms of airway 
hyperreactivity or as a unique clinical entity. Simple spirometry confirms the 
suspected clinical diagnosis in most instances, although more sensitive 
measurements of airway obstruction may be required. In general, the asthmatic 
need not restrict physical activity because of exercise-induced attacks. The 
disease responds well to prophylactic management with a wide variety of 
antiasthmatic agents, such as theophylline preparations, beta-agonists, and 
cromolyn sodium.
