BACKGROUND: Hypophosphatemia, defined as low serum phosphate levels, is a 
frequent yet underrecognized condition associated with significant morbidity. 
Its etiology ranges from chronic conditions such as osteomalacia to acute states 
such as refeeding syndrome. This review systematically summarizes evidence and 
guidelines for phosphate testing and supplementation in adults, aiming to 
support clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines. 
Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from 
inception to September 2024 included reviews, guidelines, and consensus 
statements addressing phosphate measurement for hypophosphatemia and 
supplementation in adults outside intensive care settings. Eligibility criteria 
included English-language publications focused on diagnostic and therapeutic 
recommendations. Quality assessment was performed using the AGREE II tool, and 
data were synthesized across chronic and acute clinical contexts.
RESULTS: Thirty-three publications (11 guidelines, 19 reviews, and 3 consensus 
statements) were included, with high heterogeneity in the recommendations. 
Phosphate measurement to evaluate chronic hypophosphatemia is recommended for 
persistent musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis evaluation, and rare 
conditions known to cause chronic hypophosphatemia, such as X-linked 
hypophosphatemia and tumor-induced osteomalacia. The post-kidney transplantation 
stage requires intensive early monitoring for hypophosphatemia. Recommendations 
for testing for drug-induced hypophosphatemia, such as with ferric 
carboxymaltose, vary. Phosphate measurement to evaluate acute hypophosphatemia 
is advised in high-risk settings: refeeding syndrome, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar 
syndrome, alcoholic ketoacidosis, worsening COPD or asthma exacerbations. 
Further potential indications for phosphate measurement include certain iron 
infusions, tenofovir treatment, immediate post-kidney transplantation, and 
intensive hemodialysis. Supplementation is indicated for severe or symptomatic 
cases, with oral therapy preferred for chronic conditions and intravenous routes 
for acute, severe hypophosphatemia.
CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity in the recommendations emphasizes the need for 
individualized approaches based on clinical context. While robust evidence 
supports testing and supplementation under select conditions, gaps remain 
regarding optimal dosing and monitoring protocols. Clinicians should consider 
phosphate testing in high-risk scenarios and follow evidence-based 
supplementation guidelines tailored to chronic and acute hypophosphatemia. 
Future research is needed to unify recommendations and address existing 
uncertainties.
