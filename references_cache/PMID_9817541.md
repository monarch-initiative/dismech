Although new disease-altering treatments offer hope for those with multiple 
sclerosis, they are not appropriate for most. Management of symptoms, however, 
can help everyone with the disease. Several new therapies, including tizanidine, 
intrathecal baclofen, botulinum toxin injections, gabapentin, ondansitron, 
thalamic stimulation, and lamotrigine, increase our treatment options. Better 
understanding of the sleep disorders that commonly occur in those with multiple 
sclerosis will help us treat another disabling symptom. This chapter reviews the 
medical and surgical management of multiple sclerosis symptoms, including these 
new options.
