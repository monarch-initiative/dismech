The incidence and geographical distribution of dengue have greatly increased in 
recent years. Dengue is an acute mosquito-transmitted viral disease 
characterised by fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, rash, nausea, and 
vomiting. Some infections result in dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), a syndrome 
that in its most severe form can threaten the patient's life, primarily through 
increased vascular permeability and shock. The case fatality rate in patients 
with dengue shock syndrome can be as high as 44%. For decades, two distinct 
hypotheses to explain the mechanism of DHF have been debated-secondary infection 
or viral virulence. However, a combination of both now seems to be the plausible 
explanation. The geographical expansion of DHF presents the need for 
well-documented clinical, epidemiological, and virological descriptions of the 
syndrome in the Americas. Biological and social research are essential to 
develop effective mosquito control, medications to reduce capillary leakage, and 
a safe tetravalent vaccine.
