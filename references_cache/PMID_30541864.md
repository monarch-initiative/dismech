OBJECTIVE: To delineate the epileptology, a key part of the SYNGAP1 phenotypic 
spectrum, in a large patient cohort.
METHODS: Patients were recruited via investigators' practices or social media. 
We included patients with (likely) pathogenic SYNGAP1 variants or chromosome 
6p21.32 microdeletions incorporating SYNGAP1. We analyzed patients' phenotypes 
using a standardized epilepsy questionnaire, medical records, EEG, MRI, and 
seizure videos.
RESULTS: We included 57 patients (53% male, median age 8 years) with SYNGAP1 
mutations (n = 53) or microdeletions (n = 4). Of the 57 patients, 56 had 
epilepsy: generalized in 55, with focal seizures in 7 and infantile spasms in 1. 
Median seizure onset age was 2 years. A novel type of drop attack was identified 
comprising eyelid myoclonia evolving to a myoclonic-atonic (n = 5) or atonic (n 
= 8) seizure. Seizure types included eyelid myoclonia with absences (65%), 
myoclonic seizures (34%), atypical (20%) and typical (18%) absences, and atonic 
seizures (14%), triggered by eating in 25%. Developmental delay preceded seizure 
onset in 54 of 56 (96%) patients for whom early developmental history was 
available. Developmental plateauing or regression occurred with seizures in 56 
in the context of a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). Fifty-five 
of 57 patients had intellectual disability, which was moderate to severe in 50. 
Other common features included behavioral problems (73%); high pain threshold 
(72%); eating problems, including oral aversion (68%); hypotonia (67%); sleeping 
problems (62%); autism spectrum disorder (54%); and ataxia or gait abnormalities 
(51%).
CONCLUSIONS: SYNGAP1 mutations cause a generalized DEE with a distinctive 
syndrome combining epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia with absences and 
myoclonic-atonic seizures, as well as a predilection to seizures triggered by 
eating.
