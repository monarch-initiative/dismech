Mineralocorticoid replacement in Addison's disease.

Thompson DG, Mason AS, Goodwin FJ.

Eight patients with treated Addison's disease were studied whilst receiving 
different doses of fludrocortisone together with a constant intake of 
glucocorticoid. Plasma renin activity (PRA), blood pressure, pulse rate and 
plasma potassium and urea concentrations were measured after 2-week periods on 
each dose. In two patients, PRA measurements indicated that mineralocorticoid 
replacement therapy had been inadequate. In four others, PRA remained normal 
throughout the study, even after fludrocortisone had been discontinued, 
suggesting that the drug was unnecessary for the maintenance of normal sodium 
balance in these patients. Asymptomatic fludrocortisone overdosage was indicated 
by a low plasma potassium concentration, but not by PRA measurements which 
failed in this study to distinguish between adequate and excessive 
mineralocorticoid replacement.
