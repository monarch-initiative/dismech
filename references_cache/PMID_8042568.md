The human parvovirus B19 has been identified as the causative agent in several 
diseases, including the benign childhood condition erythema infectiosum (fifth 
disease), a polyarthropathy that occurs in adults, aplastic crisis and hydrops 
fetalis. The virus has also been associated with numerous other hematologic, 
neurologic and rheumatic conditions. Except for the potential of neonatal death 
due to fetal hydrops, the prognosis of patients with parvovirus infection is 
generally good. The diagnosis of B19 infection may be established on clinical 
grounds but often requires confirmation with serum antibody testing. Treatment 
strategies may include supportive care, analgesic medications, transfusions with 
red blood cells or administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, depending on 
the clinical circumstances.
