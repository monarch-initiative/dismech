BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive gastric 
cancer (GC) represents a distinct molecular cancer subtype that is often 
associated with a poor prognosis. While perioperative chemotherapy regimens are 
currently the primary recommendation for locally advanced HER2-positive GC, 
combination therapies incorporating immune checkpoint inhibitors are under 
active investigation.
CASE SUMMARY: The present case describes a patient with locally advanced 
HER2-positive GC who underwent perioperative treatment with chemotherapy 
combined with trastuzumab. Although significant tumor shrinkage was observed, 
surgical pathology results did not confirm the achievement of a pathological 
complete response. The current treatment strategies for advanced GC were also 
reviewed. Relevant case reports, retrospective studies, and prospective clinical 
trials were retrieved for analysis after searching the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and American Society of Clinical 
Oncology/European Society for Medical Oncology conference abstracts between 2014 
and 2024.
CONCLUSION: Large-scale phase III clinical trials are needed to verify the 
efficacy of combined neoadjuvant treatment application for GC.
