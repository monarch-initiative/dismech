OBJECTIVES: The management of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) is 
challenging due to progressive functional disability, increased comorbidities, 
and high drug-related risks. EORA is defined as disease onset after 60 years 
since 1985. We assessed whether this cut-off age was optimal in a progressively 
ageing society.
METHODS: This study used two cohorts of consecutive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
patients: the Nippon Medical School (NMS) cohort (n = 204) and the Keio cohort 
(n = 296). Clinical findings independently correlated with the age of RA onset 
were selected as 'EORA features' from previously reported EORA characteristics 
using univariable and multivariable regression analyses. Receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis was conducted to determine the cut-off age that 
best selected patients with all EORA features.
RESULTS: Acute onset, negative anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and 
high erythrocyte sedimentation rate were selected as 'EORA features' in both 
cohorts. Patients with all EORA features were more numerous with age and almost 
exclusively older than 65 years. The optimal EORA cut-off age was 73 years with 
an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82 in the NMS cohort and 68 with an AUC of 
0.93 in the Keio cohort. In the NMS cohort, Health Assessment 
Questionnaire-Disability Index and comorbidities in patients with disease onset 
between 60 years and the projected cut-off age were similar to those in 
younger-onset RA, but differed from those in patients with disease onset older 
than the projected cut-off age.
CONCLUSION: The optimal EORA cut-off age was greater than the conventional 
definition, but this needs to be validated in different patient populations.
