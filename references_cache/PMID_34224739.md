BACKGROUND & AIMS: DNA mismatch repair deficiency drives microsatellite 
instability (MSI). Cells with MSI accumulate numerous frameshift mutations. 
Frameshift mutations affecting cancer-related genes may promote tumorigenesis 
and, therefore, are shared among independently arising MSI tumors. Consequently, 
such recurrent frameshift mutations can give rise to shared immunogenic 
frameshift peptides (FSPs) that represent ideal candidates for a vaccine against 
MSI cancer. Pathogenic germline variants of mismatch repair genes cause Lynch 
syndrome (LS), a hereditary cancer syndrome affecting approximately 20-25 
million individuals worldwide. Individuals with LS are at high risk of 
developing MSI cancer. Previously, we demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of 
an FSP-based vaccine in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in patients with a history 
of MSI colorectal cancer. However, the cancer-preventive effect of FSP 
vaccination in the scenario of LS has not yet been demonstrated.
METHODS: A genome-wide database of 488,235 mouse coding mononucleotide repeats 
was established, from which a set of candidates was selected based on repeat 
length, gene expression, and mutation frequency. In silico prediction, in vivo 
immunogenicity testing, and epitope mapping was used to identify candidates for 
FSP vaccination.
RESULTS: We identified 4 shared FSP neoantigens (Nacad [FSP-1], Maz [FSP-1], 
Senp6 [FSP-1], Xirp1 [FSP-1]) that induced CD4/CD8 T cell responses in naïve 
C57BL/6 mice. Using VCMsh2 mice, which have a conditional knockout of Msh2 in 
the intestinal tract and develop intestinal cancer, we showed vaccination with a 
combination of only 4 FSPs significantly increased FSP-specific adaptive 
immunity, reduced intestinal tumor burden, and prolonged overall survival. 
Combination of FSP vaccination with daily naproxen treatment potentiated immune 
response, delayed tumor growth, and prolonged survival even more effectively 
than FSP vaccination alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preclinical findings support a clinical strategy of recurrent 
FSP neoantigen vaccination for LS cancer immunoprevention.
