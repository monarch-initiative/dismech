Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) has been associated with recurrent pregnancy 
loss. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism in unclear but may be associated with 
an imbalance in the prostacyclin/ thromboxane ratio, which results in 
vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. Antiphospholipid syndrome is 
diagnosed through laboratory tests and clinical assessment. Various regimens are 
used to treat women who have APS. The purpose of this article is to review this 
disorder and discuss indications for testing, diagnosis and treatment, and 
nursing implications.
