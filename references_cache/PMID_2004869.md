The authors investigate the impact of the migrant labor system on heterosexual 
relationships on South African mines and assess the implications for the future 
transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The migrant labor 
system has created a market for prostitution in mining towns and geographic 
networks of relationships within and between urban and rural communities. A 
section of the migrant workforce and a group of women dependent on prostitution 
for economic support appear especially vulnerable to contracting HIV infection 
since they are involved in multiple sexual encounters with different, changing 
partners, usually without condom protection. Furthermore, sexually transmitted 
disease morbidity is extensive in the general and mineworker populations. 
Historically, migration facilitated the transmission of sexually transmitted 
diseases and may act similarly for HIV. Problems of combating the HIV epidemic 
in South Africa are discussed.

PIP: The impact of the migrant mine labor system in South Africa on transmission 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was assessed by reviewing the literature 
on epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV, and 
interviewing at length 20 male miners and 24 women supporting themselves near 
the mines as prostitutes or mistresses. Interview subjects were selected by 
"strategic informant snowball sampling," a type of purpose sampling used in 
anthropological studies, best for collecting descriptive data. Interviews 
focused on familial, marital, sexual experiences and perceptions of migrant mine 
workers and their wives and female partners. While official reports from mine 
management states that there is little likelihood that HIV will spread among 
migrant workers and their contracts, STD morbidity rates in these groups have 
almost doubled between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, and reports of HIV infection 
are high in some areas, notably Malawi and Botswana. The HIV prevalence among 
Malawian migrants rose from 3.8% in 1986 to 21% in 1989, with an African pattern 
of transmission. The migrant labor system is based on "hostels" where male mine 
workers live in barracks for long periods or indefinitely, separated from wives 
and families. Men pass the time drinking and seeking female companionship and 
sex, either as long-term sexual partners, casual short-term partners, or cash 
clients. The system takes a toll on marriages, with high rates of divorce and 
abandonment, leaving many women, who are then rejected by their families, with 
prostitution as their only subsistence option. People viewed AIDS education 
messages from mine management with suspicion, often blamed AIDS on the mines or 
other ethnic groups, and neither sex used or expressed interest in using 
condoms. Thus this population fits the description in the epidemiology of STDs 
of a high-risk core group with multiple partners and frequent partner change, 
and the mobility to be major carriers to urban, suburban and rural areas. It is 
suggested that AIDS education be initiated by empathetic groups such as trade 
unions and the African National Congress, by prevent suspicion of racism or 
genocide as motivation for the campaign.
