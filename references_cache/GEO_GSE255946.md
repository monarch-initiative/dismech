# Notum Regulates the Cusp and Root Patterns in Mouse Molar

## Content

Notumis a direct target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and plays a crucial role as a Wnt inhibitor within a negative feedback loop. In the tooth, Notum is known to be expressed in odontoblasts, and severe dentin defects and irregular tooth roots have been reported in Notum-deficient mice. However, the precise expression pattern of Notum in early tooth development, and the role of Notum in crown and root patterns remain elusive. In the present study, we identified a novel Notum expression in primary enamel knot (EK), secondary EKs, and dental papilla during tooth development. Notum-deficient mice exhibited enlarged secondary EKs, resulting in broader cusp tips, altered cusp patterns, and reduced concavity in crown outline. These alterations in crown outline led to a reduction in cervical tongue length, thereby inducing root fusion in Notum-deficient mice. Overall, these results suggest that the size of secondary EK size, regulated by the Wnt/Notum negative feedback loop, has a significant impact on the patterns of crown and root during tooth morphogenesis.
