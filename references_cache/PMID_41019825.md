INTRODUCTION: The main treatment of otomycosis has required the use of topical 
antifungal drops and/or acidifying agents. However, because of the availability 
issues of antifungal drops in developing countries, treatment with acidifying 
agents alone is necessary.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy in the 
treatment of otomycosis using a 10% povidone-iodine and clotrimazole solution.
METHODS: Patients with otomycosis were assigned to 10% povidone-iodine group and 
Clotrimazole group. The patients were evaluated on the response of each group at 
1, 2,4 and 8 weeks.
RESULTS: 93 patients were assigned to the 10% povidone-iodine group and 95 
patients to the Clotrimazole group. the response to treatment between groups. In 
the second week after treatment, 37.64% of the 10% povidone-iodine group and 40% 
of the Clotrimazole group had a good response to treatment (p = 0.551). In the 
fourth week after treatment, 52.69% of the 10% povidone-iodine group and 55.79% 
of the Clotrimazole group had a good response to treatment (p = 0.644). In the 
eighth week after treatment, 58.06% of the 10% povidone-iodine group and 64.21% 
of the Clotrimazole group had a good response to treatment (p = 0.642) In the 
12th week after treatment, 76.34% of the 10% povidone-iodine group and 85.26% of 
the Clotrimazole group had a good response to treatment (p = 0.248).
CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the response to between 
10% povidone-iodine and Clotrimazole groups in the second, fourth, eighth and 
twelfths after treatment.
