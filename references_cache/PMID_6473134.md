Fever during treatment for bacterial meningitis.

Lin TY, Nelson JD, McCracken GH Jr.

The records of 476 infants and children with bacterial meningitis treated 
between 1979 and 1982 were reviewed. By the sixth hospital day 90% or more of 
children with pneumococcal or meningococcal infection compared with 72% of 
children with Haemophilus infection (P less than 0.001) were afebrile. The rates 
of prolonged fever for 10 days or more, persistent fever for 5 to 9 days and 
secondary fever were 13, 13 and 16%, respectively. The conditions associated 
with prolonged fever for 10 days or more were subdural effusion (27%), drug 
fever (23%) and concomitant arthritis or pneumonia (20%); 15% were of 
indeterminable cause. The principal conditions associated with persistent fever 
for 5 to 9 days were other foci of disease (17%), nosocomial infections (16%) 
and subdural effusion (14%); in 42% the cause was unknown. The conditions 
associated with secondary fever were nosocomial infections (27%) and subdural 
effusion (23%); 39% were of indeterminable cause. Neither the duration nor the 
patterns of fever correlated with neurologic abnormalities at discharge, 
including hearing deficit.
