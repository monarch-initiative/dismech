Cilia are essential cellular antennae that rely on precise motor-driven 
transport to assemble and function. Two kinesin-2 motors-kinesin-II and OSM-3 in 
Caenorhabditis elegans-cooperate to transport cargo along cilia, with kinesin-II 
operating in the middle segment and OSM-3 taking over distally. However, how 
kinesin-II is spatially confined to prevent its invasion into distal regions 
remains unclear. Here, we identify Joubert syndrome 26 protein (JBTS-26) as a 
critical regulator of this motor handover. JBTS-26 localizes to axonemal doublet 
microtubules in the ciliary middle segment, where it competes with kinesin-II 
for binding to the IFT-B subunit OSM-5/IFT88. This competition displaces 
kinesin-II from IFT particles, enabling OSM-3 to assume distal transport. Loss 
of JBTS-26 allows kinesin-II to invade the distal cilium and slows down IFT. 
Conversely, JBTS-26 overexpression accelerates IFT by prematurely releasing 
kinesin-II. Our findings reveal a mechanism for compartmentalized motor 
regulation and link defective motor handover to ciliopathy pathogenesis.
