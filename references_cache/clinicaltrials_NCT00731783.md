# Household vs. Individual Approach to Decolonization of Community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus.

## Content

The purpose of this study is to determine whether measures to eliminate the Staph germ from the skin of the index patient (with a special ointment and soap) are more effective when performed by everyone in the household rather than the patient alone, and whether these methods are effective in preventing future Staph infections. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a greater number of households who are successful in eradicating the staph germ from the index patient when all members of the household participate than households where only the index patient is treated.
