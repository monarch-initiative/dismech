CSF IL-6 is elevated in transverse myelitis (TM) and predicts disability. Since 
IL-17 regulates cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) known to stimulate IL-6 
production by astrocytes, we sought to determine whether IL-17 was increased in 
TM and MS compared to healthy controls (HC) and other neurologic diseases (OND). 
IL-17 and IL-6 levels were measured in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear 
cell (PBMC) supernatants from HC, MS, TM and OND. IL-17 was increased in TM 
compared to HC, MS, and OND (mean pg/ml+/-standard error; HC: 36.1+/-11.7, MS: 
89.4+/-23.3, TM: 302.6+/-152.5, OND: 41.2+/-13.0, p=0.01). IL-6 was increased in 
TM relative to MS and HC (HC: 2624 pg/ml+/-641, MS: 6129+/-982, TM: 
12,536+/-2657, OND: 6920+/-1801, p<0.002). MS patients with early disease (<2 
years) also had increased levels of IL-17 (p<0.04) and IL-6 (p<0.05). Cytokine 
neutralization experiments demonstrated that IL-6 was the main inducer of 
astrocyte IL-6 production. We conclude that IL-17 and IL-6 production from PBMC 
in TM and early MS are increased and induce astrocyte IL-6 production through 
IL-6.
