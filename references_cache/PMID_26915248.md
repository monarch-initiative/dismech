Although significant effort has been made for the development of treatment and 
prevention of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, one has to keep in mind that basic 
supportive therapy, including sufficient hydration to the patients, would be a 
standard of care for Ebola hemorrhagic fever and other antiviral therapy would 
be an adjunct to this standard of care. Also, effective antiviral drug to dengue 
virus is not known, and a basic supportive therapy, including fluid therapy, 
would be a standard of care and prevent serious type of dengue virus infections. 
Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug must not be used, because 
they promote bleeding and acidosis.
