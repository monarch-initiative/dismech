AIM: Campylobacteriosis is a major cause of gastroenteritis globally, but 
comprehensive data on its prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns 
in Iran are limited. This study aimed to estimate the national prevalence of 
Campylobacter-associated gastroenteritis in Iran, analyze temporal trends in 
infection rates, and characterize antibiotic resistance patterns among 
circulating Campylobacter spp. over the past two decades.
METHODS: In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search was performed across the 
Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Islamic World Science Citation Center 
(ISC), Scientific Information Database (SID), and Magiran databases for studies 
published from 2000 to 2025. Eligible studies were assessed based on predefined 
inclusion criteria, followed by both qualitative and quantitative analyses of 
the selected studies. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Joanna 
Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist, and data analysis was 
conducted utilizing the R statistical programming language along with the 'meta' 
package. A random-effects model was applied to calculate the pooled prevalence, 
while heterogeneity was measured using the I² statistic and a prediction 
interval.
RESULTS: A total of 46 studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis using a 
random-effects model revealed an overall pooled prevalence of 8.0% (95% CI: 
6.0-10.0%), with substantial heterogeneity among studies (I² = 97.0%, 
p < 0.0001), likely due to variability in diagnostic methods, populations, and 
study designs. Subgroup analysis showed a higher prevalence for C. jejuni 
(35.0%, 95% CI: 22.0-49.0%, I² = 98.5%) compared to C. coli (16.0%, 95% CI: 
11.0-22.0%, I² = 75.5%), while C. lari was excluded due to rarity. A temporal 
assessment revealed a peak prevalence of 11.0% (95% CI, 7.0-15.0%, I² = 94.2%) 
during the period 2013-2020, indicating a general upward trend over time. In 
patients ≤ 10 years, prevalence was 6.0% (95% CI, 3.0-9.0%, I² = 92.1%), with C. 
jejuni and C. coli responsible for 45.0% (95% CI, 13.0-80.0%) and 14.0% (95% CI, 
7.0-23.0%) of cases, respectively. Among those ˃ 10 years, prevalence was 8.0% 
(95% CI, 6.0-11.0%, I² = 97.6%), with 32.0% (95% CI, 18.0-47.0%) for C. jejuni 
and 16.0% (95% CI, 10.0-24.0%) for C. coli. Resistance to ciprofloxacin (65%; 
higher in C. coli) and nalidixic acid (98%; higher in C. jejuni) - both 
quinolones-has shown a consistent and sharp increase, reaching the highest 
resistance levels in recent years. Similarly, tetracycline (79%; higher in C. 
coli) resistance has followed a rising trend, particularly in C. coli and 
overall Campylobacter spp., making these antibiotics increasingly ineffective 
for empirical treatment.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis highlight a moderate but 
rising prevalence of gastroenteric Campylobacter infections in Iran, with C. 
jejuni being the predominant species. Increasing resistance to quinolones, 
tetracyclines, and macrolides poses a serious threat to treatment, especially in 
C. coli. While gentamicin shows sustained low resistance, its parenteral 
administration restricts routine use, limiting its role to severe cases. 
Strengthened national surveillance, standardized diagnostics, and robust 
antimicrobial stewardship, particularly in poultry-the main source of human 
disease-are urgently needed.
