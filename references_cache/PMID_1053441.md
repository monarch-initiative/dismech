Pigeon breeders' disease--a prevalence study and review.

Christensen LT, Schmidt CD, Robbins L.

Among fifty-three Salt Lake City, Utah area pigeon fanciers, 21% were found to 
have the clinical picture of pigeon breeders' disease. This is a much higher 
frequency than has been observed previously. Abnormal spirometry and increased 
skin reactivity to pigeon sera were found more often, statistically 
significantly, in symptomatic than in exposed asymptomatic fanciers. Pigeon 
breeders' disease is associated with a variety of abnormal findings; skin test, 
precipitins, pulmonary function changes and radiographic derangements; but 
unfortunately none of these are diagnostic. Pigeon breeders' disease is best 
identified by clinical criteria.
