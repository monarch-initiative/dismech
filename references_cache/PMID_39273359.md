Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion 
of proline- and glutamine-rich proteins, widely termed "gluten", in genetically 
susceptible individuals. CD induces an altered immune response that leads to 
chronic inflammation and duodenal mucosal damage. Currently, there are no 
specific tests for the accurate diagnosis of CD, and no drugs are available to 
treat this condition. The only available treatment strategy is lifelong 
adherence to a gluten-free diet. However, some studies have investigated the 
involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in CD pathogenesis. miRNAs are small noncoding 
ribonucleic acid molecules that regulate gene expression. Despite the growing 
number of studies on the role of miRNAs in autoimmune disorders, data on miRNAs 
and CD are scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to perform a literature review to 
summarize CD, miRNAs, and the potential interactions between miRNAs and CD in 
adults. This review shows that miRNA expression can suppress or stimulate 
pathways related to CD pathogenesis by regulating cell proliferation and 
differentiation, regulatory T-cell development, innate immune response, 
activation of the inflammatory cascade, focal adhesion, T-cell commitment, 
tissue transglutaminase synthesis, and cell cycle. Thus, identifying miRNAs and 
their related effects on CD could open new possibilities for diagnosis, 
prognosis, and follow-up of biomarkers.
