Fourteen dogs diagnosed with Addison's disease and having atypical serum 
electrolyte levels are described. Seventy-eight percent were female, and most 
showed signs of inappetence, weakness, or vomiting. Ninety-three percent of the 
cases had either hyponatremia without hyperkalemia or normal serum electrolyte 
concentrations. Hemogram features were variable and were not useful in 
suggesting a diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism. The results of this study show 
that normal or mild serum electrolyte changes in a dog with clinical signs 
compatible with Addison's disease should not exclude this diagnosis from 
consideration. Definitive diagnosis depends on the demonstration of inadequate 
adrenocortical response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation.
