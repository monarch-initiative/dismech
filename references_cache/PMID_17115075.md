Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neurological disability in 
young adults. Recent studies have implicated specific sodium channel isoforms as 
having an important role in several aspects of the pathophysiology of MS, 
including the restoration of impulse conduction after demyelination, axonal 
degeneration and the mistuning of Purkinje neurons that leads to cerebellar 
dysfunction. By manipulating the activity of these channels or their expression, 
it might be possible to develop new therapeutic approaches that will prevent or 
limit disability in MS.
