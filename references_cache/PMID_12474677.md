Diabetic ketoacidosis is an emergency medical condition that can be 
life-threatening if not treated properly. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs most 
often in patients with type 1 diabetes (formerly called insulin-dependent 
diabetes mellitus); however, its occurrence in patients with type 2 diabetes 
(formerly called noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) is not as rare as was 
once thought. This article reviews data about precipitating events, 
pathogenesis, carbohydrate, lipid and ketone, water and electrolyte metabolism 
in this hyperglycemic crisis. The review discusses diagnostic procedures, 
laboratory evaluation, differential diagnosis and treatment: replacement of 
fluid and electrolytes, low-dose insulin therapy and recommendations for use of 
bicarbonate. A discussion of complications management of diabetic ketoacidosis 
(hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, cerebral edema, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, 
pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome), mortality rate and 
prevention are included in this review.
