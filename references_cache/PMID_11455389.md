Brachydactyly type A-1 (BDA-1; MIM 112500) is characterized by shortening or 
missing of the middle phalanges (Fig. 1a). It was first identified by Farabee in 
1903 (ref. 2), is the first recorded example of a human anomaly with Mendelian 
autosomal-dominant inheritance and, as such, is cited in most genetic and 
biological textbooks. Here we show that mutations in IHH, which encodes Indian 
hedgehog, cause BDA-1. We have identified three heterozygous missense mutations 
in the region encoding the amino-terminal signaling domain in all affected 
members of three large, unrelated families. The three mutant amino acids, which 
are conserved across all vertebrates and invertebrates studied so far, are 
predicted to be adjacent on the surface of IHH.
