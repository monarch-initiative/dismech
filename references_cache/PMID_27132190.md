Robust computational approaches are needed to characterize systems-level 
responses to chemical perturbations in environmental and clinical toxicology 
applications. Appropriate characterization of response presents a methodological 
challenge when dealing with diverse phenotypic endpoints measured using in vivo 
systems. In this article, we propose an information-theoretic method named 
Aggregate Entropy (AggE) and apply it to scoring multiplexed, phenotypic 
endpoints measured in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) across a broad 
concentration-response profile for a diverse set of 1060 chemicals. AggE 
accurately identified chemicals with significant morphological effects, 
including single-endpoint effects and multi-endpoint responses that would have 
been missed by univariate methods, while avoiding putative false-positives that 
confound traditional methods due to irregular correlation structure. By testing 
AggE in a variety of high-dimensional real and simulated datasets, we have 
characterized its performance and suggested implementation parameters that can 
guide its application across a wide range of experimental scenarios.
