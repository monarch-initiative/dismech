Objective: To study the genetic changes and biological potential of 
proliferative nodule in congenital melanocytic nevus. Methods: Whole-exome 
sequencing was carried out using the technique of next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) in order to detect the genomic alterations of two cases of proliferative 
nodules (PN) in congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN). Twelve cases of CMN and ten 
cases of malignant melanoma were used as benign and malignant controls, 
respectively. Mutated genes that possessed statistically significant difference 
between benign and malignant controls were listed, according to what benign and 
malignant statuses were classified and clustered. The heatmaps of clustering 
analyses were depicted using heatmap package. Fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) was also used to validate the above results. Results: Eighty-six common 
somatic gene mutations were detected in two samples of PN. Compared with CMN, PN 
had 52 more mutated genes. Furthermore, 22 of these 52 mutated genes were also 
detected in malignant melanoma samples. Two cases of PN fell between benign CMN 
and malignant melanoma in germline mutation clustering. Both cases of PN were 
positive in the FISH tests. Conclusions: The genetic changes of PN partially 
overlap with those of CMN and malignant melanoma. Therefore, although most of 
the PN manifest as a benign lesion clinically, it may have certain malignant 
potential at the genetic level, and warrant long-term monitoring and follow-up.

Publisher: 目的： 探讨先天性色素痣中增生结节的基因学改变及生物学潜能。 方法： 
采用二代测序方法检测24例皮肤黑色素性肿瘤中全外显子基因改变，包括2例先天性色素痣中增生结节、12例良性的先天性色素痣和10例恶性的黑色素瘤。利用测序结果比较增生结节与先天性色素痣及黑色素瘤之间的关系并进行基因组聚类分析，从而进一步揭示增生结节的基因水平特点及其生物学潜能。同时采用4色荧光原位杂交（FISH）对增生结节区域进行检测。 
结果： 
在2例先天性色素痣的增生结节样本中检测到86个共同的体细胞基因突变，其中有52个基因是增生结节组相比于先天性色素痣组增多的突变基因，而这52个突变基因当中22个基因高发于黑色素瘤组。以先天性色素痣和黑色素瘤中有明显差异的变异基因为标准做聚类分析，显示先天性色素痣和黑色素瘤有明显分界，增生结节的基因变异介于先天性色素痣和黑色素瘤之间。4色FISH检测2例增生结节均为阳性。 
结论： 
增生结节的基因改变介于良性色素痣与恶性黑色素瘤之间，推测增生结节虽然临床表现多为良性生物学行为，但是在基因水平上具有一定的恶性潜能，这类患者在临床中需要长期监测和随访。.
