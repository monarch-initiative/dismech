Neonatal lupus syndrome is a passively acquired autoimmune syndrome in which 
pathogenic autoantibodies (anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, and both, or rarely 
anti-U(1)RNP antibodies) are transmitted from a mother to her fetus through the 
placenta. The major clinical manifestations in the infants are cardiac 
(congenital heart block), dermatologic (skin lesion), hepatic (elevated hepatic 
enzymes), and hematologic (cytopenia). Congenital complete heart block (CCHB) is 
irreversible, while noncardiac manifestations are transient, resolving by 
one-year-old of age without specific treatments. Two prospective studies show 
that the prevalence of CCHB in children from a woman previously known to have 
anti-SSA/Ro antibodies is approximately 2%. However, when the previous pregnancy 
is complicated by CCHB and skin lesion, the recurrence rates of these symptoms 
go much higher to 10.5% and 26%, respectively, in the subsequent pregnancy.
