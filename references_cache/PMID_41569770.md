BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype CNS WHO grade 4 
(formerly primary glioblastoma multiforme), is the most common and most 
malignant primary brain tumor. High-grade gliomas most commonly present as 
unifocal lesions; however, they invade the brain parenchyma in a diffuse manner, 
an attribute that renders successful resection difficult. Resection, wherein 
resection of more than 90% of the tumor mass must be achieved to improve 
outcomes, represents the first step in optimal treatment; therefore, surgical 
planning, approach, and technique are of utmost importance for successful 
treatment.
OBSERVATIONS: In this paper, the authors present a rare case of a glioblastoma 
presenting as an atypical bilateral lesion with erosion through the falx 
cerebri. Morphologically, it was overtly distinct from a typical butterfly 
glioma. Initially, the authors believed this tumor to be a meningioma, or even a 
sarcoma, based on radiological morphology. Intraoperatively, destruction of the 
falx cerebri by the tumor, with spread to the contralateral hemisphere, was 
seen.
LESSONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the erosion of the falx cerebri 
has not been previously described in glioblastoma in the literature, and this 
case highlights the importance of a thorough differential diagnosis and 
understanding its impact on surgical planning.
