# RNA-Sequencing of Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis compared with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Control Lung

## Content

Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) is caused by an immune response to antigen inhalation and is characterized by variable histopathological and clinical features. A subset of CHP subjects have usual interstitial pneumonia and appear to be clinically similar to subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the molecular relationship between CHP and IPF is not well understood. We report an RNA-seq based transcriptomic analysis for whole lung tissues from CHP, IPF and control subjects.
