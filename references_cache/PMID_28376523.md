In patients with Lynch syndrome, gynecologic cancer often can be the first 
presenting malignancy. In this review, we summarize the genetics of Lynch 
syndrome and review the various modalities of identifying patients at risk for 
this syndrome. The clinical characteristics of Lynch-associated endometrial 
cancer and screening and risk-reducing strategies also are described.
