BACKGROUND: Although the incidence and cure rate of spinal hydatidosis are low, 
the recurrence rate of spinal hydatidosis is high, and the prognosis of spinal 
hydatidosis is poor. Therefore, we report a typical case of refractory spinal 
hydatidosis to increase spine surgeons' awareness of the disease and reduce 
misdiagnosis and recurrence.
CASE SUMMARY: A 48-year-old man presented with back pain, significant weight 
loss, and paralysis of both lower limbs. The patient was misdiagnosed with 
spinal tuberculosis in an outside hospital. However, spinal magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) showed hyperintense cystic components on T2-weighted images and 
hypointensity on T1-weighted images. A lobulated, multiocular, 
honeycomb-appearance, septated cystic mass protruding intraspinally and 
compressing the spinal cord at segments T8-T9 was present. Paravertebral 
polycystic lobular lesions presented as a "bunch of grapes". The ELISA test 
result for Echinococcus granulosus was positive. Then, a diagnosis of spinal 
hydatidosis and lung hydatid disease was made, and the patient underwent left 
transthoracic approach lobectomy, paravertebral lesion debridement, and subtotal 
vertebrectomy with vertebral body replacement of segments T8 and T9 by a mesh 
cage. The patient also underwent albendazole chemotherapy before and after 
surgery. One year after stopping the drug therapy, the patient developed 
recurrent T5 vertebral lesions and underwent a second subtotal vertebrectomy 
surgery. The patient is currently in good condition and is receiving long-term 
medication and follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The MRI feature of a "bunch of grapes" is a typical imaging 
indication of spinal hydatidosis. Subtotal vertebrectomy is a risk factor for 
postoperative recurrence. Total spondylectomy makes it possible to cure spinal 
hydatidosis, but antiparasitic drug therapy is also an important supplementary 
therapy to multimodal therapy. It is preferable for patients with spinal 
hydatidosis to receive life-long antiparasitic medication therapy and follow-up.
