BACKGROUND: A. aegypti production and human density may vary considerably in 
dengue endemic areas. Understanding how interactions between these factors 
influence the risk of transmission could improve the effectiveness of the 
allocation of vector control resources. To evaluate the combined impacts of 
variation in A. aegypti production and human density we integrated field data 
with simulation modeling.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using data from seven censuses of A. aegypti 
pupae (2007-2009) and from demographic surveys, we developed an agent-based 
transmission model of the dengue transmission cycle across houses in 16 
dengue-endemic urban 'patches' (1-3 city blocks each) of Armenia, Colombia. Our 
field data showed that 92% of pupae concentrated in only 5% of houses, defined 
as super-producers. Average secondary infections (R(0)) depended on infrequent, 
but highly explosive transmission events. These super-spreading events occurred 
almost exclusively when the introduced infectious person infected mosquitoes 
that were produced in super-productive containers. Increased human density 
favored R(0), and when the likelihood of human introduction of virus was 
incorporated into risk, a strong interaction arose between vector production and 
human density. Simulated intervention of super-productive containers was 
substantially more effective in reducing dengue risk at higher human densities.
SIGNIFICANCE/CONCLUSIONS: These results show significant interactions between 
human population density and the natural regulatory pattern of A. aegypti in the 
dynamics of dengue transmission. The large epidemiological significance of 
super-productive containers suggests that they have the potential to influence 
dengue viral adaptation to mosquitoes. Human population density plays a major 
role in dengue transmission, due to its potential impact on human-A. aegypti 
contact, both within a person's home and when visiting others. The large 
variation in population density within typical dengue endemic cities suggests 
that it should be a major consideration in dengue control policy.
