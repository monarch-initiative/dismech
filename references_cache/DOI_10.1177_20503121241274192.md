## Content

Background: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been linked to over 200,000 cases of illness in hospitalized patients and over 20,000 deaths annually. Up to 25% of patients with an initial CDI episode will experience recurrent CDI (rCDI), which most commonly occurs in the first 8 weeks following antibiotic therapy. In patients with first or multiple rCDI, infection, the microbiome is similarly disrupted, which highlights the challenges of using antibiotics alone while underscoring the need for microbiome restoration regardless of the number of recurrences. In this systematic review, we describe the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome in CDI, and systematically review fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk (VOWST™; VOS for Vowst Oral Spores) for prevention of recurrence in rCDI. Methods: The PubMed database was searched using “recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection” AND (SER-109 OR VOS) and limited to clinical trials. The search yielded 7 results: 3 articles describing 3 clinical trials (two Phase 3 trials (ECOSPOR III and ECOSPOR IV) and one Phase 2 trial (ECOSPOR)), 1 describing follow-up of ECOSPOR III, 1 describing a post hoc analysis of comorbidities in ECOSPOR III, and 2 describing health-related quality of life in ECOSPOR III. Results: Compared with placebo, VOS following standard-of-care antibiotics for CDI significantly reduced risk of recurrence at 8 weeks (relative risk, 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18–0.58); p < 0.001; number needed to treat: 4) with a tolerable safety profile; rCDI rates remained low through 24 weeks. The disrupted microbiome, secondary to/exacerbated by antibiotic treatment, was rapidly (i.e., Week 1) restored with VOS. Compared with placebo, VOS demonstrated greater improvements in health-related quality of life. Conclusions: Clinical care of patients with rCDI now includes Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutics to address microbiome restoration. Clinical trial evidence supports use of VOS following antibiotics and importance of microbiome restoration in rCDI.
