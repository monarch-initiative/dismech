Much of natural product chemistry concerns a group of compounds known as 
secondary metabolites. These low-molecular-weight metabolites often have potent 
physiological activities. Digitalis, morphine and quinine are plant secondary 
metabolites, whereas penicillin, cephalosporin, ergotrate and the statins are 
equally well known fungal secondary metabolites. Although chemically diverse, 
all secondary metabolites are produced by a few common biosynthetic pathways, 
often in conjunction with morphological development. Recent advances in 
molecular biology, bioinformatics and comparative genomics have revealed that 
the genes encoding specific fungal secondary metabolites are clustered and often 
located near telomeres. In this review, we address some important questions, 
including which evolutionary pressures led to gene clustering, why closely 
related species produce different profiles of secondary metabolites, and whether 
fungal genomics will accelerate the discovery of new pharmacologically active 
natural products.
