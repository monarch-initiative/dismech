This case report describes the unusual presentation of a 32-year-old male from 
Guayaquil, Ecuador, who was diagnosed with a rare triple infection caused by 
Salmonella typhi, Leptospira, and Campylobacter coli. The patient presented with 
persistent high fever, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain, and 
jaundice, following the consumption of street food in a resource-limited area. 
Important clinical findings included hepatosplenomegaly and elevated liver 
enzymes, which initially complicated the differential diagnosis. Laboratory 
tests confirmed the presence of all three pathogens, presenting significant 
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to overlapping symptoms and potential 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The main diagnoses included typhoid fever, 
leptospirosis, and campylobacteriosis, each requiring distinct yet coordinated 
treatment approaches. The patient was managed with a combination of antibiotics 
targeting each pathogen and supportive care to address dehydration and liver 
dysfunction. After a prolonged hospital stay, the patient recovered with no 
residual symptoms, underscoring the success of a tailored, multidisciplinary 
approach in the context of limited healthcare resources. This case underscores 
the importance of clinical awareness regarding co-infections, particularly in 
areas with inadequate sanitation, where infectious diseases are endemic. The 
successful management of this complex case highlights the necessity of rapid, 
accurate diagnostics and coordinated therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes 
in patients with multi-pathogen infections. This report also emphasizes the 
critical need for surveillance and tailored interventions in regions facing 
rising AMR, enhancing our understanding of how to approach emerging infectious 
diseases in underserved populations.
