Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue (HDCTs) are syndromes that disrupt 
connective tissue integrity. They include Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), Ehlers 
Danlos Syndrome (EDS), Marfan Syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (LDS), 
Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), Stickler Syndrome (STL), Wagner Syndrome, and 
Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE). Because many patients with HDCTs have ocular 
symptoms, commonly myopia, they will often present to the clinic seeking 
refractive surgery. Currently, corrective measures are limited, as the FDA 
contraindicates laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in EDS and 
discourages the procedure in OI and MFS due to a theoretically increased risk of 
post-LASIK ectasia, poor wound healing, poor refractive predictability, 
underlying keratoconus, and globe rupture. While these disorders present with a 
wide range of ocular manifestations that are associated with an increased risk 
of post-LASIK complications (e.g., thinned corneas, ocular fragility, 
keratoconus, glaucoma, ectopia lentis, retinal detachment, angioid streaks, and 
ocular surface disease), their occurrence and severity are highly variable among 
patients. Therefore, an HDCT diagnosis should not warrant an immediate 
disqualification for refractive surgery. Patients with minimal ocular 
manifestations can consider LASIK. In contrast, those with preoperative signs of 
corneal thinning and ocular fragility may find the combination of collagen 
cross-linking (CXL) with either photorefractive keratotomy (PRK), small incision 
lenticule extraction (SMILE) or a phakic intraocular lens (pIOL) implant to be 
more suitable options. However, evidence of refractive surgery performed on 
patients with HDCTs is limited, and surgeons must fully inform patients of the 
unknown risks and complications before proceeding. This paper serves as a 
guideline for future studies to evaluate refractive surgery outcomes in patients 
with HDCTs.
