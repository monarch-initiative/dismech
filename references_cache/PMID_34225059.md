INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Dieulafoy's lesion is a rare entity, normally 
present in the stomach and more rarely in the colon, and it is responsible for 
1% to 5% of acute gastrointestinal bleeding cases. Its true incidence may be 
underrated, since most cases are asymptomatic and difficult to diagnose despite 
endoscopic advances. We present a clinical case of acute gastrointestinal 
bleeding due to Dieulafoy's lesion in the cecum.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 85-year-old woman presented with a clinical condition of 
haematochezia associated with anaemia and haemodynamic instability, needing 
blood transfusion. Colonoscopy demonstrated a Dieulafoy's lesion in the cecum 
with active bleeding, and haemostasis was performed successfully with localized 
adrenaline injection and haemostatic clip placement. Hospitalization occurred 
without further complications.
DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of Dieulafoy's lesion is difficult because it is a 
rare condition and thus, usually not included in the differential diagnosis of 
gastrointestinal bleeding. Its endoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic approach is 
the standard method in the event of an acute gastrointestinal bleeding episode, 
with greater efficiency with the combined use of haemostatic techniques. Surgery 
is necessary in less than 5% of cases when bleeding is not effectively 
controlled by endoscopic or angiographic techniques.
CONCLUSION: It is essential to be aware of this lesion as a possible cause of 
gastrointestinal bleeding and differentiate it from other causes. Advances in 
endoscopy have increased the rate of diagnosis of these lesions and reduced 
their associated mortality.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent medical condition with a potential of significant morbidity and mortality. Symptoms and severity vary depending on the location and bleeding output. The common causes include peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal or duodenal erosions [1], [2]. Dieulafoy's lesion is a rare cause of acute gastrointestinal bleeding [1], [3].

Dieulafoy's lesion, first reported by Gallard in 1984 and then described in detail by Georges Dieulafoy in 1898, is a rare vascular malformation characterized by an abnormally dilated submucosal artery (1 to 3 mm). Since its description first, it has rarely been reported in the literature. These lesions can be found in any location of the gastrointestinal tract; however, they occur more frequently in the stomach and rarely in the colon [2], [4].

This uncommon lesion normally presents without associated symptoms. It is diagnosed by gastrointestinal endoscopy. When the patient presents with bleeding, most cases require therapy to control it, which is mainly performed by minimally invasive methods, such as endoscopy or angiography; a few cases need surgery [4], [5].

This report presents a clinical case of gastrointestinal bleeding due to Dieulafoy's lesion in the cecum, a very rare location with sparse literature representation. This article has been written in accordance with the SCARE 2020 criteria [6].

An 85-year-old woman was institutionalized at a retirement home and was partially dependent for daily life activities with multiple medical and surgical backgrounds (arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, grade II obesity, class II heart failure, chronic renal disease, atrial fibrillation and biological aortic valve prosthesis under oral hypocoagulation with apixaban, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin).

The patient was admitted to the emergency room with a clinical condition of ongoing haematochezia for two days and an associated episode of syncope. On physical examination, she was hypotensive (96/50 mmHg) and had bright red blood on rectal examination, without other major associated changes. Blood analysis revealed a haemoglobin level of 3.7 g/dL and acute renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, thus requiring intravenous fluid therapy and 5 units of erythrocyte concentrate transfusion.

After colonic preparation, a colonoscopy was performed that showed the presence of a tortuous pulsatile vessel in the submucosa of the cecum (suggestive of Dieulafoy's lesion) with oozing haemorrhage (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).Fig. 1Dieulafoy's lesion with oozing haemorrhage.Fig. 1Fig. 2Dieulafoy's lesion after washing with saline fluid.Fig. 2

For long-term maintenance, we decided to stop aspirin and restart apixaban after discussion with the Cardiology Department and analysing the patient's risk-benefit ratio.

During hospitalization, the patient was stable with no new haematic losses; the haemoglobin levels were stable at 8.8 g/dL with resolution of the acute renal dysfunction presented at admission (creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL at discharge).

The patient was discharged after 6 days of hospitalization with no complications.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the most common medical emergencies in the world, with an incidence of 50 to 150 per 100,000 individuals each year [1], [2], [3]. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is approximately four times more frequent than lower gastrointestinal bleeding [7]. Almost 80% of bleeding cases are caused by ulcerative disease, varicose disease or angiectasis, with occult haemorrhage occurring in less than 5% of cases [2].

Dieulafoy's lesion, also known as calibre persistent artery, is a rare vascular malformation, which is an uncommon cause of potentially life-threatening bleeding [2], [3]. Despite its rarity, it is being increasingly reported due to the widespread use of endoscopy. The artery is otherwise histologically normal; however, it consists of an aberrant submucous artery, in the absence of a primary ulcer, that erodes the epithelium and does not normally branch to the mucosa, maintaining a diameter of 1 to 3 mm (a calibre 10 times larger than a normal mucous capillary) [4], [9], [10]. These lesions are thought to be the cause of only 1% to 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeding cases. Most cases are asymptomatic and even with clinical presentation its diagnosis is difficult; therefore, its true incidence is unknown [2], [3], [8], [10].

Its pathophysiology is not fully understood, and two main hypotheses are currently proposed. The first is that of a congenital base predisposing to the appearance of an abnormally dilated artery with risk of protrusion, rupture, and haemorrhage. The second hypothesis is based on a degenerative background caused by oxidative and ischemic stress of diverse or even multifactorial causes, such as chronic gastritis, previous surgeries, and alcohol consumption or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage [2], [4], [10], [11], [12]. Despite its uncertain pathogenesis, it is known that these vascular lesions are more frequent in the elderly or individuals with more underlying diseases [2], [4], [9], [11], [13].

Dieulafoy's lesions affect males twice as often as females and can occur at any age [2], [5], [14]. The stomach is the most commonly affected organ (80% to 95%), usually at 5 to 6 cm from the gastroesophageal junction along the lesser curvature. However, they can be found at any gastrointestinal location, including the oesophagus, small intestine, colon, or rectum; although, these locations are much less frequent [2], [3], [4], [8].

The lesion usually remains asymptomatic until the overlying epithelium completely erodes with full arterial exposure [2], [5], [14]. The mechanism that causes haemorrhage is still unclear; however, there is a general consensus that a mucosal erosion or ischemic lesion leads to greater weakening of an intrinsically vulnerable point, possibly leading to bleeding and unmasking this silent abnormality [2], [12].

Its presentation depends on its location, ranging from haematemesis or melena to haematochezia or fresh bleeding per rectum. Most of the haemorrhage caused is intermittent and severe, with haemodynamic instability present in almost 80% of the cases. The mortality has decreased significantly due to the effectiveness of the treatment [2], [3], [4], [5], [14].

The present patient had a Dieulafoy's lesion present in the colon, namely in the cecum. As reported in the literature, she had significant haemorrhage with haemodynamic instability, thus requiring blood transfusion. The first lesion to be found and reported in the colon was originally described in 1985 by Barbier. Since then, limited cases of colonic lesions have been published, mostly located in the right colon [14].

The diagnosis is challenging since these lesions have a small and indiscriminate dimension with intermittent bleeding; besides, its rarity can lead to it being easily confused with other lesions such as arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms [4], [5], [14]. Gastrointestinal endoscopy is the first line diagnostic procedure since it allows for diagnosis and a possible therapeutic approach during active bleeding [4], [5]. Endoscopy is effective in diagnosing about 70% of the patients, and diagnostic accuracy increases with active bleeding. For this reason, this diagnosis should always be considered during an endoscopic examination without a clear bleeding identification. The presence of an isolated protruding vessel surrounded by normal mucosa without any ulcer or associated mass are classic endoscopic findings [2], [4], [11].

Despite the existence of several effective therapeutic approaches, there is neither consensus nor randomized controlled studies comparing the different endoscopic techniques. However, endoscopic treatment has been the method of choice since this approach has been shown to be effective towards bleeding from a Dieulafoy's lesion with a success rate of over 90% [2], [4]. Studies demonstrated a higher success rate with mechanical haemostatic techniques than with local haemostatic injections alone [2], [4], [15]. In addition, the combined use of different endoscopic techniques showed a lower rate of haemorrhagic recurrence compared with endoscopic monotherapy [4], [9], [16]. In most cases, haemostasis is achieved through local injection of epinephrine in conjunction with heat probe coagulation or haemostatic clip placement [4], [17], [18].

When endoscopy fails to find the bleeding source, angiography may be helpful in locating and controlling it, with selective arterial embolization. This approach should be used in endoscopic failure, lesions not accessible by endoscopy and patients unsuitable for surgery [2], [8], [19]. Surgical treatment is necessary in less than 5% of cases, being reserved only when endoscopic or angiographic treatment fail [2], [8], [11], [20].

The present case of Dieulafoy's lesion in the colon was diagnosed through colonoscopy, performed after patient's stabilization, with effective haemostasis after combined use of endoscopic techniques (local injection of adrenaline and placement of haemostatic clips), as well as most lesions reported in the literature.

The risk of bleeding recurrence varies between 9% and 40% and is higher when endoscopic monotherapy is performed. Repeated endoscopy is the therapy of choice in the evidence of recurrence [9], [11], [21]. The prognosis for acute bleeding due to a Dieulafoy's lesion is better than that caused by ulcerative disease, matching that endoscopic advances have increased the diagnostic rate and decreased the mortality rate from 80% to 8.6% [9], [19], [21]. In the present case, treatment was effective without recurrence, and therefore, a favourable outcome was seen.

Dieulafoy's lesion in the colon is a very rare entity with a potential for massive haemorrhage with consequent mortality. Its diagnosis is difficult, mainly due to its rarity, especially when this lesion is found in less frequent locations. Endoscopic treatment is the first diagnostic and therapeutic choice due to its effectiveness, mainly through the combined use of available techniques, as performed in the presented case. Clinicians should be aware of this lesion as a possible cause of gastrointestinal bleeding; thus being able to differentiate it from others aetiologies for selective and prompt therapeutic management.
