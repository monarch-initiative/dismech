Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Activating 
mutations in the EGFR and rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
or ROS proto-oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) genes have been 
identified as oncogenic drivers in non-small-cell lung cancer. Development of 
specific small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, able to interfere with tumor 
growth and metastatic spread, dramatically changed the natural history of 
oncogene-addicted non-small-cell lung cancer. However, despite advances in 
targeted therapies, all patients inevitably develop acquired resistance to 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Novel promising and effective treatments are under 
investigations.
