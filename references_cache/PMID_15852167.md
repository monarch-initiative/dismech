We report a case of Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
CASE REPORT: A nine-year-old boy was having problems of recent loss of vision 
when in the dark. He was born with polydactyly in the feet for which he had 
surgery performed when he was seven weeks old. Mental retardation was 
significant and his vision was poor. Clinical and electrophysiologic 
examinations showed the existence of a pale optic disc and loss of the 
electroretinographic response under scotopic and photopic conditions.
DISCUSSION: Based on the history, presentation, ophthalmic clinical examination, 
obesity, mental retardation and dental alterations, the patient was diagnosed 
with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Current references are reviewed.
