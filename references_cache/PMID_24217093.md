Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by 
joint swelling, joint tenderness and destruction of synovial joints, leading to 
severe disability. RA is considered an autoimmune disease. A study in the UK 
found the population minimum prevalence of RA is 1.16% in women and 0.44% in 
men. In Australia, the estimated prevalence is 0.6%. Using BEACH data from April 
2011 to March 2013, we examined the rate of RA and its management in Australian 
general practice.
