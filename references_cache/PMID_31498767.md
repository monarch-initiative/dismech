Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs) are used primarily to treat hypertension and are also useful for 
conditions such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease, independent of 
their effect on blood pressure. This article reviews the indications for ACE 
inhibitors and ARBs and offers advice for managing their adverse effects, 
particularly declining renal function and hyperkalemia.
