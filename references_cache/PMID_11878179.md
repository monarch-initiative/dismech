Cleft palate is one of the common features of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia 
congenita (SEDC). However, there are few clinical data about cleft palate in 
SEDC. We report four patients with cleft palate and SEDC including two with 
overt cleft palate and two with submucous cleft palate. Our results suggested 
that SEDC associated with cleft palate should be treated in the same way as 
solitary cleft palate, and submucous cleft palate may be more common in patients 
with SEDC than previously appreciated.
