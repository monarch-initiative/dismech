More than half of pregnant women are usually affected by odontogenic pain 
affects. Pain often accompanies periapical or pulp infections and increases the 
risks to pregnant patients and their fetuses. The American Dental Association, 
in partnership with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, has 
offered a strong declaration reaffirming the significance of suitable and timely 
oral health care as an indispensable constituent of a healthy pregnancy. 
However, there is lack of knowledge about the use of antibiotics in endodontic 
treatment. Therefore, the present study would review the researches done in this 
area and tries to provide comprehensive and complete information about the use 
of antibiotics in endodontic treatment during pregnancy. Based on the results, 
it can be said that using antibiotics during pregnancy are allowed, and they can 
be used normally and safely by pregnant women.

Conflict of interest statement: We confirm that we have read the Journal’s 
position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report 
is consistent with those guidelines. Oral disease in pregnant women is a major 
public health issue worldwide. Pregnancy does come with inherent risks and the 
idea that dental treatment should not be implemented due to pregnancy is not 
debatable. Special concerns are necessary as a pregnant woman seeks dental 
care;, hence, the treatment related to these patients may need more attention to 
reduce treatment time and make changes in the type of dental treatment and 
prescribed drugs. Appropriate risk assessment for the mother and fetus should be 
performed.According to results of a novel study about pregnant women, it was 
recognized that more than 43% of them have oral health problems, containing 
odontogenic infections and pain. It is normal that most of odontogenic 
infections develop quickly to deep-seated infections that ultimately endanger 
the airway of oropharyngeal. Moreover, dental infections usually present with 
symptoms of pain and swelling in the mouth. Misuse of drugs instead of receiving 
proper dental treatment may consequently lead to damaging effects on the 
pregnant patient and fetus; so, during pregnancy, it is necessary to notice that 
odontogenic infections must be treated quickly at any time. One of the suggested 
treatments is endodontic treatment, which includes cleaning and removing the 
pulp of a patient's teeth. Root Canal Therapy (RCT) may include radiography, 
local anesthesia, root cleaning, and intracanal drugs such as analgesics and 
antibiotics. During endodontic treatment, radiography is essential, and to have 
appropriate diagnosis, proper obstruction, length of work, and assessment after 
treatment, radiographs are needed. As X-rays during intraoral radiography are 
directed to the mouth and not the abdomen, it is considered safe for pregnant 
women. In addition, when performing radiography, a protective method like 
collimation, high-speed film, lead apron, and filtration is also applied. It is 
recommended that concerned pregnant patients be reassured that the as Low as 
Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) standard will be used in all circumstances 
requiring radiographs and that only the necessary radiographs for both treat and 
diagnosis will be obtained. During pregnancy, local anesthesia is considered 
rather safe if it is managed properly and in the exact amount. The overall idea 
is that sometimes there is a need to administer an increased quantity of 
anesthesia and that the effects of stress are more dangerous than those of the 
increased quantity of local anesthesia. Most anesthesia contain vasoconstrictor 
epinephrine. A maximum dose of 0.1 mg has been added to local anesthesia. No 
side impacts or abnormalities have been reported, even after the implementation 
of epidural anesthesia during childbirth. Local anesthesia with epinephrine, 
used as an intravascular injection, has been reported to at least cause a 
decrease in placental uterine blood flow. It has been reported that for healthy 
pregnant women, a concentration of 1: 100,000 epinephrine applied in dentistry 
is considered safe accompanied with an appropriate aspiration procedure and 
limited to the minimum necessary dose., During pregnancy, RCT is applied to 
achieve the goals such as preserving a healthy oral environment, controlling the 
illness, and avoiding possible problems that may happen during the 
post-childbirth time or in late pregnancy. None of the detergents, hypochlorites 
and root canal fillers used in endodontic are claimed to be harmful to the 
fetus. In addition, some antibiotics and analgesics can be safely prescribed by 
your dentist as an adjunct to endodontic treatment. MANAGEMENT OF EMERGENCIES 
AND ACUTE DISEASE: In situations such as mild cellulite, drugs like cephalexin, 
penicillin and amoxicillin, as first-line antibiotics would probably beselected. 
Also, in the case of allergy to penicillin, Erythromycin or clindamycin 
(Cleocin) may be applied.The pregnant patient with severe cellulite should be 
treated at a hospital with an intravenous infusion of clindamycin or 
cephalosporin. To relive toothache, Acetaminophen can be prescribed. Besides, 
controlled use of oxycodone and Ibuprofen are proper. SOME COMMON KINDS OF 
DENTAL TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN EACH TRIMESTER: First trimester: 
The most vital period for fetal growth. Emergency treatment should be 
implemented whether or not organogenesis is complete, there are precautions to 
be made and the patient’s obstetrician should be consulted if organogenesis is 
incomplete, but emergency treatment is vital. If a pregnant patient experienced 
a toothache, the dentist can make an emergency opening, eliminate the inflamed 
pulp (or) drain the pus, and release the pain. Intracanal drugs such as 
chlorhexidine/metronidazole and calcium hydroxide can be used. In addition, 
programs containing Plaque diet control for pregnant patient can be initiated. 
Second trimester: During the second trimester of pregnancy, it is the safest 
phase for treating patients. So, elective and emergency dental treat can be 
administered in the second trimester. Also, other treatments can be done like 
periodontal surgery, tooth extraction, and root canal treat. Third trimester: If 
the patient has a toothache, emergency treat can be administered and if 
possible, transfer definitive treat to the post-childbirth time. In 2012, the 
American Dental Association issued a statement reaffirmed in 2019. It underlines 
the significance of oral health for pregnant patients at the correct time and in 
the suitable place. Treatment, the inhibition and control of odontogenic 
infections as an appropriate treatment is necessary to a healthy pregnancy, yet, 
it has been reported that oral treatments during pregnancy are avoided by 
numerous dental treat providers., Evidence for the use of antibiotics as 
complementary medicine in endodontic treatment is given below.According to the 
obtained results of some studies in Canada and Netherlands, about 25% to 50% of 
pregnant women have received antibiotics., However, it is necessary to prescribe 
antibiotics to pregnant women after evaluating their disadvantages and 
advantages. It should also be noted that infections can be dangerous for both 
mother and fetus. For example, one of the risks of spreading infection from the 
mandibular second molars is the possibility of Ludwig's angina., INDICATIONS FOR 
ANTIBIOTICS IN DENTISTRY: According to studies, the use of antibiotics in some 
cases such as surgery to remove benign tumors, surgery for extraction of 
impacted teeth, surgery for an implant, bone grafting, and periapical surgery, 
is prescribed for patients. In treatment of acute infections like invasive 
localized periodontitis, ulcerative gingivitis, acute apical abscess, 
periodontal abscess, peri-implantitis, cellulite and pericoronitis, the 
antibiotics are also suggested., TRANSPORT ACROSS THE PLACENTA: Antibiotics have 
high fat solubility and low molecular weight. This maintains a high 
concentration of antibiotics in the blood and facilitates their transfer through 
the placental barrier. In addition, oral antibiotics are safer than Systemic 
antibiotics because of their lower absorption., CLASSIFICATION OF ANTIBIOTICS: 
The FDA has divided antibiotics into five categories based on their side effects 
during pregnancy: Category A: This category includes antibiotics that have been 
adequately controlled in studies and have not reported any specific side effects 
during pregnancy. Category B: Antibiotics have not been observed any specific 
complications in humans during pregnancy, but side effects have been observed in 
animals. Category C: Antibiotics do not have sufficient information about their 
side effects in pregnant women or animals. Category D: Antibiotics that have 
side effects, but they have been proven in pregnancy, but when necessary, their 
benefits are more than their disadvantages. Category X: Antibiotics those side 
effects have been proven in humans and animals and their disadvantages are more 
than their advantages. The next part is a list of the most common antibiotics 
applied in dentistry during pregnancy. Penicillin To treat odontogenic 
infections, Penicillins are suggested as beta-lactam antibiotics. Amoxicillin, 
ampicillin (category B), and penicillin VK are suggested as common dental 
antibiotics. According to the statement of the FDA, no relation has yet been 
reported linking the implementation of amoxicillin during pregnancy to the 
miscarriage, the main birth defects, or fetal and maternal side effects. The 
same results were reported by the Teratogen System Information (TERIS) by 
examination of 25,000 implementation of penicillin in pregnancy and the 
increased danger of pregnancy outcomes. Nevertheless, there are some evidences 
that confirm the congenital defects of the oral-maxillofacial complex like cleft 
lip and palate and hypomineralization in tooth enamel as results of the use of 
amoxicillin during pregnancy. As a beta-lactamase inhibitor antibiotic, the 
combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) is very effective 
in treating sever odontogenic infections. No evidences have been reported of the 
relationship between increased dangers of fetal or congenital defects by 
exposure to therapeutic doses of this combination drug during pregnancy (18). It 
is worthy to point that the danger of a severe disease called necrotizing 
enterocolitis in the newborn is increased by use of this drug in the third 
trimester. While the complete danger of infection is not high, this combination 
drug should be eluded in the third trimester of pregnancy. Cephalosporin They 
are considered a kind of beta-lactam antibiotics with a broad range. There is no 
evidence approving an increased danger of spontaneous abortion or miscarriage in 
pregnant patients used cephalosporins. The reports about the relationship 
between congenital defects in infants and prenatal implementation of 
cephalosporins are conflicting. Based on results of an examination working on 
the impacts of cephalosporins in initial use, no adverse effects were reported. 
It is worthy to mention that some studies approved the relationship between 
implementation of cephalosporin, anorectal atresia, and atrial septal deficiency 
in infants. Yet, the danger of developing abnormalities is not high. Clindamycin 
This drug is frequently applied for patients with a previous hypersensitivity to 
beta-lactam. There is not enough clinical information on the safety of this 
category (B). While clindamycin is not associated with outcomes of pregnancy and 
abortion on the fetus, its use has been associated with congenital 
cardiovascular and musculoskeletal abnormalities., Metronidazole Metronidazole 
is a very effective category B drug derived from nitroimidazole. The antibiotic 
metronidazole is prescribed against anaerobic bacteria, usually in combination 
with penicillin, to treat odontogenic infections. Concerns about the 
mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of metronidazole have been reported in animal 
studies; while in human studies the absence of these cases has been confirmed., 
There are not same obtained results regarding prenatal metronidazole use and a 
developed danger of miscarriage. No meaningful relationships have been reported 
between prenatal metronidazole use and fetal deficiencies or adverse 
pregnancy.,, Tetracycline Tetracyclines are the same as tetracycline, 
oxytetracycline, minocycline, and doxycycline. They are all broad-spectrum 
antibiotics classified in category D., A study has reported a statistically 
significant relationship between the use of tetracycline antibiotics and 
spontaneous abortion of the fetus. In addition, the use of tetracyclines has 
been shown to stain permanent teeth and discolor them., Therefore, it is 
recommended that tetracycline be avoided during pregnancy except there is a 
convincing cause. Macrolide Macrolides are similar in antibacterial range to 
penicillin and usually used for patients with allergy to penicillin. In 
dentistry, the most frequently used of this group are azithromycin (category B), 
erythromycin (category B), and clarithromycin (category C).. Based on the new 
findings, macrolide use has not been related to cardiovascular defects in 
newborns and the previous beliefs were rejected. According to gained results of 
a novel meta-analysis, an increased danger of cerebral palsy-epilepsy, 
miscarriage, and gastrointestinal abnormalities were reported as the results of 
macrolide use during pregnancy. Based on another finding, acetate macrolides are 
not relatively safer than basic form of erythromycin. [Table: see text] 
Fluoroquinolones They are broad-range category C antibiotics with restricted 
usage. For odontogenic infections, they are just applied for patients with 
allergy to penicillins or treatment of bacteria unaffected by other antibiotics. 
Meanwhile, their implementation for odontogenic infections in endodontics is 
restricted. Meta-analysis findings have not been able to reveal the use of 
fluoroquinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, that upsurge the danger of preterm 
delivery, miscarriage, and fetal abnormalities., Table 1. shows management of 
antibiotics for pregnant patients in dentistry. BENEFITS AND HARMS OF 
ANTIBIOTICS: Most pregnant women are prescribed to use a variety of medicines. 
The drugs may have teratogenic influences on the fetus during pregnancy. In 
addition, drugs used during breastfeeding can have severe effects on the health 
of the baby. During pregnancy and lactation, one of the most used drugs is 
antibiotics frequently prescribed by doctors. INFECTIONS AND PRETERM LABOR: 
According to the definition of The World Health Organization, preterm labor is 
labor that happens at more than 20 weeks and less than 37 weeks gestation. The 
frequency of preterm labor in developed countries differs between 7 and 11%., In 
the last 40 years, in spite of all progresses in midwifery care, the danger of 
prematurity has not reduced. In developed countries, prematurity is recognized 
as one of the main reasons of mortality and neonatal morbidity and it is the 
cause of 60% to 80% of neonatal mortality deprived of congenital abnormalities. 
Despite the low percentage of births less than 32 weeks' gestation (only 1% to 
2% of all births), they are reason for 50% of long-term neurological problems as 
well as 60% of prenatal deaths., Pointing to the financial issues, preterm labor 
is remarkably significant as one-tenth of the cost of general child care and 
one-third of the cost of caring for infants is related to preterm labor.,During 
the two past decades, many kinds of investigations have underlined the reasons 
of preterm labor and consequently various correlated risk elements have been 
recognized. Most common reported ones are congenital causes of infectious 
origin. The possible associations between preterm labor and infection can be 
explained by models that claim that preterm labor is initiated by an 
inflammatory reaction to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, 
interleukin (IL) -1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Based on the evidences from clinical 
and laboratory examinations, there is a relationship between labor and systemic 
infections and spontaneous preterm labor., As a result, it is widely an accepted 
logical assumption that antibiotics play an effective role in the handling of 
preterm labor., Although the relationship between inflammation and infection 
with the increased danger of preterm labor is crucial, yet it is not identified 
whether antibiotic handling can inhibit it. Moreover, it is believed that 
antibiotic treatment to inhibit preterm labor can be dangerous., SIDE EFFECTS OF 
MISUSE OF ANTIBIOTICS: Antibiotic resistance is a natural phenomenon, but it can 
be caused by the misuse of antibiotics. The plans to inhibit his misuse of 
antibiotics can have consequent worldwide results for inhibiting the expansion 
of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. There is some data that antibiotic 
implementation can lead to severe side effects such as gastrointestinal 
abnormalities, allergic reactions, and cardiac arrhythmias, and death The 
expansion of resistant bacteria is recognized as a main problematic issue linked 
to the overuse of antibiotics., It is claimed that the use of antibiotics during 
fetal-neonatal life has an opposing and long-term influence on the maternal 
intestinal microbiota and the maternal vaginal microbiota. Furthermore, it can 
lead to the expansion of allergic illnesses. Antibiotics may also inhibit and 
delay with the beginning colonization of the baby's gut microbiota. This 
inhibition may restrict the development and growth of the baby's immune system, 
causing diseases and allergies., Overuse of antibiotics for pregnant women is 
linked to the presence of many antibiotic-resistant organisms, as the rate of 
erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus (Group B) -one of the selective antibiotics 
after premature rupture of membranes (PROM) prescribed in most British 
hospitals- and reaches 35%. In conclusion, according to the results of 
researches, aspecifically evidences published by the American Dental Association 
with American Obstetricians, the use of some antibiotics during pregnancy are 
allowed and can be used normally and safely by pregnant women.
