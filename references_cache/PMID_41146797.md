Labyrinthitis ossificans is a rare but serious complication that can occur 
following inner ear trauma, often resulting in irreversible sensorineural 
hearing loss. We present the case of a 22-year-old male who developed 
progressive sensorineural hearing loss after a motor vehicle accident. 
High-resolution CT and MRI revealed ossification within the membranous 
labyrinth, consistent with labyrinthitis ossificans. This case highlights the 
importance of early radiologic assessment in post-traumatic hearing loss, as 
timely diagnosis is essential for optimizing cochlear implantation outcomes and 
preserving auditory function in patients with severe inner ear damage.
