Aniridia and Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome are related, human ocular disorders that 
are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Both result from 
incorrect development of the eye and have, as their most serious consequences, 
elevated risk to develop the blinding condition glaucoma. This review will focus 
on describing the clinical presentations of Aniridia and Axenfeld-Rieger 
Syndrome as well as the molecular genetics and current and emerging therapies 
used to treat patients.
