Hyperostosis frontalis interna (HFI) has been reported in high frequency among 
post-menopausal elderly women. Although it was widely discussed in the past, 
this entity is rarely mentioned in the current pathology literature. We report a 
postmortem case of a 56 yr-old post-menopausal woman with irregular thickening 
of the internal surface of the frontal bone. Histology revealed an organized 
trabecular pattern with overall thickening of the cancellous bone. The 
periosteum and cortical bone were unaffected. The finding was considered to be 
unrelated to her death. HFI should be recognized as a benign entity and 
distinguished from other disorders that involve the frontal skull bone, such as 
Paget's disease, acromegaly, and malignancy. The etiology of HFI is unknown, but 
current hypotheses implicate hormonal stimulation.
