Ciliopathies are rare genetic disorders characterized by significant genetic and 
phenotypic variability. Over 140 proteins localized to primary cilia, which are 
sensory organelles essential for vertebrate development, are implicated. TMEM17 
encodes a transmembrane protein at the ciliary transition zone and was 
previously proposed as a potential ciliopathy gene, based on reports of 
individuals from two families with orofaciodigital syndrome type 6 (OFD6) and 
Joubert syndrome (JS). Here, we report two unrelated fetuses with occipital 
encephalocele, polydactyly, and kidney cysts, in whom exome sequencing 
identified a founder homozygous missense variant (Arg94Trp) in TMEM17, affecting 
a highly conserved residue. This expands the TMEM17-associated phenotypic 
spectrum to include Meckel syndrome (MKS). Comprehensive functional analyses of 
all known TMEM17 variants, using patient tissues/cells and a C. elegans model 
system, demonstrate a loss-of-function mechanism. Our study reveals severe 
functional consequences, including TMEM17 destabilization and mislocalization, 
anomalies in cilium composition and function, and abrogation of Sonic Hedgehog 
signaling. These experiments confirm the pathogenicity of all TMEM17 variants 
and underscore its essential role at the ciliary transition zone. Collectively, 
our findings establish TMEM17 as a bona fide ciliopathy gene, associated with a 
wide phenotypic spectrum ranging from viable syndromes (OFD6 and JS) to a 
fetal-lethal condition (MKS).
