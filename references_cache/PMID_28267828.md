Satoyoshi Syndrome with Progressive Orofacial Manifestations: A Case History 
Report.

Li J, Peng D, Jiang T, Avivi-Arber L.

A young female patient suffering from Satoyoshi syndrome had the first 
characteristic signs and symptoms of hair loss and progressive spontaneous 
intermittent painful spasms of limb muscles at age 6.5 years. Thereafter, she 
developed chronic diarrhea, amenorrhea, and skeletal deformities. In the 
orofacial region, she suffered from painful spasms of the masseter (jaw closing) 
muscles, progressive tooth loss, and degeneration of the mandibular condyles. 
Treatment with steroids and provision of complete dentures improved the signs 
and symptoms. Early diagnosis and timely provision of multidisciplinary care can 
minimize complications in these patients and improve their orofacial functions 
and quality of life.
