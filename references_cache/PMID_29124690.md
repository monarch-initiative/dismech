Vitiligo is a disorder of the melanocytes that results in a dynamic spectrum of 
skin depigmentation. Its etiology is complex and multifactorial, with data 
supporting several different hypotheses. Given its prominent phenotype, vitiligo 
has a significant negative impact on quality of life. Coupled with the chronic 
and incurable nature of the disease, this presents a formidable treatment 
challenge. Several treatment modalities have been instituted over the years, 
with varying efficacy. This chapter focuses on the use of ultraviolet light in 
vitiligo as an established therapeutic option.
