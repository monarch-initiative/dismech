## Content

Abstract
Purpose
Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare inborn error of immunity (IEI) with an incidence of approximately 1:200,000 and the phenotypic triad of trichorrhexis invaginate (bamboo hair), congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, and multiple atopic manifestations. Treatment options especially in infants are scarce and generally not licensed.

Methods
Case report of a 9-week-old infant with NS treated with dupilumab off-label.

Results
We report rapid and sustained resolution of allergic inflammation, deep symptom control including normalization of the skin microbiome, and catch-up somatic and psychomotor development without adverse drug reactions.

Conclusion
Due to the high complication rate of NS, especially in the first years of life, we recommend treatment with dupilumab off-label immediately after the diagnosis has been established.
