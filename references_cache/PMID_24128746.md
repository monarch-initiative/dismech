BACKGROUND: A systematic scan of the disparities intervention literature will 
allow researchers, providers, and policymakers to understand which interventions 
are being evaluated to improve minority health and which areas require further 
research.
METHODS: We systematically categorized 391 disparities intervention articles 
published between 1979 and 2011, covering 11 diseases. We developed a taxonomy 
of disparities interventions using qualitative theme analysis. We identified the 
tactic, or what was done to intervene; the strategy, or a group of tactics with 
common characteristics; and the level, or who was targeted by the effort.
RESULTS: The taxonomy included 44 tactics, 9 strategies, and 6 levels. 
Delivering education and training was the most common strategy (37%). Within 
education and training, the most common tactics were education about disease 
(14%) and self-management (11%), whereas communication skills training (3%) and 
decision-making aids (1%) were less frequent. The strategy of actively engaging 
the community through tactics such as community health workers and outreach 
efforts accounted for 6.5% of tactics. Interventions most commonly targeted 
patients (50%) and community members who were not established patients of the 
intervening organization (32%). Interventions targeting providers (7%), the 
microsystem (immediate care team) (9%), organizations (3%), and policies (0.1%) 
were less common.
CONCLUSIONS: Disparities researchers have predominantly focused on the patient 
as the target for change; future research should also investigate how to improve 
the system that serves minority patients. Areas for further study include 
interventions that engage the community, educational interventions that address 
communication barriers, and the impact of policy reform on disparities in care.
