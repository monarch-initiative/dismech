## Content

ABSTRACT
Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS) interacts with dental apical mesenchyme and guides development of the tooth root, which is integral to the function of the whole tooth. However, the key genes in HERS essential for root development are understudied. Here, we show that Axin1, a scaffold protein that negatively regulates canonical Wnt signaling, is strongly expressed in the HERS. Axin1 ablation in the HERS of mice leads to defective root development, but in a manner independent of canonical Wnt signaling. Further studies reveal that Axin1 in the HERS negatively regulates the AKT1-mTORC1 pathway through binding to AKT1, leading to inhibition of ribosomal biogenesis and mRNA translation. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein, a morphogen essential for root development, is over-synthesized by upregulated mTORC1 activity upon Axin1 inactivation. Importantly, either haploinsufficiency of the mTORC1 subunit Rptor or pharmacological inhibition of Shh signaling can rescue the root defects in Axin1 mutant mice. Collectively, our data suggest that, independently of canonical Wnt signaling, Axin1 controls ribosomal biogenesis and selective mRNA translation programs via AKT1-mTORC1 signaling during tooth root development.
