Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent condition associated with increased 
cardiovascular risk, particularly in individuals with comorbid obesity and type 
2 diabetes (T2D). Despite the widespread use of continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP) for OSA management, adherence remains suboptimal, and CPAP has 
not consistently demonstrated reductions in surrogate cardiovascular events. 
Recently, attention has focused on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
(GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors as potential 
therapeutic agents for mitigating cardiovascular risk in OSA patients. These 
agents, originally developed for T2D management, have demonstrated pleiotropic 
effects, including significant weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and 
amelioration of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness, along with 
anti-inflammatory benefits, which may be particularly beneficial in OSA. 
Emerging clinical evidence suggests that GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors can 
reduce OSA severity and improve daytime sleepiness, potentially reversing the 
adverse cardiovascular effects observed in OSA. This review explores the 
pathophysiological mechanisms linking OSA with cardiovascular disease and 
evaluates the potential therapeutic roles of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors in 
addressing cardiovascular risk in OSA patients. Further research, including 
long-term clinical trials, is necessary to establish the effectiveness of these 
therapies in reducing cardiovascular events and improving patients' reported 
outcomes in this population.
