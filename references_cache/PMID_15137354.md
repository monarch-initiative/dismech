As we learn more about the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus, we find that 
there is more yet to be learned. This may sound like a trite statement, but in 
reality it is true. The following article reviews the basic pathophysiology of 
both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus as we understand it 
today. It continues on to reveal the "things that go wrong" when there is too 
much or too little glucose available to the body organs and especially to the 
brain. The article points out the signs and symptoms to be aware of when the 
person is in the acute state of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic 
hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (or state), and severe hypoglycemia. It concludes 
with important considerations when the individual is in one of these acute 
states and contributes key points related to the control of diabetes when the 
person is in the state of compromise.
