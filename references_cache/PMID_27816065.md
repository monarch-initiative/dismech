BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that insomnia might be associated with 
an increased risk of depression with inconsistent results. This study aimed at 
conducting a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to evaluate the 
association between insomnia and the risk of depression.
METHODS: Relevant cohort studies were comprehensively searched from the PubMed, 
Embase, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases 
(up to October 2014) and from the reference lists of retrieved articles. A 
random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled risk estimates and 95 % 
confidence intervals (CIs). The I 2 statistic was used to assess the 
heterogeneity and potential sources of heterogeneity were assessed with 
meta-regression. The potential publication bias was explored by using funnel 
plots, Egger's test, and Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill methods.
RESULTS: Thirty-four cohort studies involving 172,077 participants were included 
in this meta-analysis with an average follow-up period of 60.4 months (ranging 
from 3.5 to 408). Statistical analysis suggested a positive relationship between 
insomnia and depression, the pooled RR was 2.27 (95 % CI: 1.89-2.71), and a high 
heterogeneity was observed (I 2  = 92.6 %, P < 0.001). Visual inspection of the 
funnel plot revealed some asymmetry. The Egger's test identified evidence of 
substantial publication bias (P <0.05), but correction for this bias using 
trim-and-fill method did not alter the combined risk estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that insomnia is significantly 
associated with an increased risk of depression, which has implications for the 
prevention of depression in non-depressed individuals with insomnia symptoms.
