Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Parvovirus B19 Arthropathy.

Rosenstein RK, Rosenstein PK, Kramer N, Rosenstein ED.

Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is well known for its infectivity. However, the risk 
for communicability to previously unexposed healthcare professionals is 
controversial. We report here a small outbreak of B19V infection among 
physicians and family members in an adult rheumatology practice that occurred 
after providing care for a patient with B19V arthropathy. As B19V-infected 
patients who demonstrate findings of erythema infectiosum or viral arthritis are 
generally beyond the period of transmissability, strict handwashing and droplet 
precautions remain imperative when there is contact with potentially 
pre-symptomatic family members.
