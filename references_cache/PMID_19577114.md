Cirrhosis is defined histologically as an advanced form of progressive hepatic 
fibrosis with distortion of the hepatic architecture and regenerative nodule 
formation. It may be due to a variety of causes. It can be diagnosed 
incidentally on liver biopsy or hepatic imaging studies, or patients may present 
clinically with one or more features of hepatic failure. This article gives the 
reader a broad overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and natural history of 
cirrhosis; laying the foundation for subsequent articles, which will discuss the 
diagnosis and management of each of the specific cirrhosis-related 
complications.
