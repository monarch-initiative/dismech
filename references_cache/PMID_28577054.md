The histogenesis of granulomata is dependent on various cell types. The typical 
composition is a center of macrophages/histiocytes with lymphocytes at the 
border. The sequence of events leading to granuloma formation is regulated by 
various cell types and cytokines: While Th1-associated mechanisms promote 
granuloma development, it appears that regulatory T cells as well as M2 
macrophages together with interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-13 lead to their 
dissociation and tissue healing. There is a strong correlation between structure 
and function of granulomas. Chronic inflammatory granulomatous skin diseases are 
primarily based on dysfunctional downmodulation of inflammatory processes that 
lead to and maintain granuloma formation.
