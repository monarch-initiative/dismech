BACKGROUND: Scimitar syndrome is a rare congenital cardiovascular malformation; 
its optimal management remains controversial. This study aims to present the 
clinical experience of this disease in our center.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of 34 patients with Scimitar 
syndrome documented at our institution between January 2013 and December 2018. 
The patients' clinical characteristics, management, and prognosis data were 
collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients, including 16 males and 18 females, were enrolled 
with a median age at diagnosis of 7 months and a follow-up period of 22.5 
months. The infantile form of Scimitar syndrome presents more tendency for 
pulmonary hypertension (PH), pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS), and mortality than 
the adult form. Of the 15 patients who underwent surgical correction of the 
Scimitar vein, four had post-operation PVS. There was no significant difference 
in the stenosis incidence between baffle repair and Scimitar vein reimplantation 
groups. Eight patients received interventional catheter therapy, including 
occlusion of aortopulmonary collateral arteries (APCs) and other intracardiac 
malformations, without the following surgery. The overall mortality rate was 
20.5% (7 of 34) over the study period. High-risk factors of death included age 
at diagnosis (p = 0.000), PH (p = 0.007) and PVS (p = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: Infantile Scimitar syndrome needs intense suspicion for early 
diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment. Interventional treatment of Scimitar 
syndrome alleviates pulmonary artery pressure and progression during infancy. 
Baffle repair and direct reimplantation of the Scimitar vein used in the 
surgical treatment of Scimitar syndrome are safe and have similar effects. Age 
at diagnosis, PH, and PVS are high-risk factors for death in Scimitar syndrome.
