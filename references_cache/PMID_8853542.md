We have prospectively gathered information contained in the Ontario Cancer 
Foundation computerized clinical data base to provide a quantitative description 
of palliative radiotherapy workload and fractionation practices in the 
management of non-small cell lung cancer over a ten-year period. We found that 
the proportion of radiotherapy fractionations used in palliation has declined 
steadily between 1984 and 1991. In the palliation of non-small cell lung cancer 
there has been a steady decline in the number of fractions given per course of 
treatment in the management of chest disease, bone metastases, and brain 
metastases with significant variation both between and within individual cancer 
treatment centres.
