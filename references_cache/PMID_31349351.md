Johann Friedrich Meckel (1781-1833) was a 19th century anatomist born into an 
eminent dynasty. He was a professor of anatomy, pathology, and zoology at the 
University of Halle, in Central Germany. The diverticulum, a congenital remnant 
of the vitellointestinal duct was named after him. Other eponyms include 
Meckel's cartilage, Meckel syndrome, and Meckel-Serres law of recapitulation. 
His concepts in comparative anatomy, embryology, and teratology anticipated 
Darwin. This review is a short tribute to this legend and his prolific 
contributions. LEVEL: Historic review, level V.
