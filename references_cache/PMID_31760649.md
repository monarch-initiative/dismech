Demyelination and axonal damage are responsible for neurological deficits in 
demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory 
demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. However, the pathology of 
demyelination and axonal damage in MS is not fully understood. While 
immunologists have accumulated evidence, which is involved in many immunological 
events in these diseases, neuroscientists and anatomists have also investigated 
morphological changes of myelin in these diseases. In this chapter, a new 
concept of demyelination will be described.
