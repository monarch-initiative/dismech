# plasma circRNA-expression profiles in children with pulmonary hypertension secondary to congenital heart disease

## Content

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a common and serious complication of left-to-right shunt congenital heart disease (CHD).Some studies have provided evidence indicating that various circRNAs are abnormally expressed in pulmonary hypertension. However, the diagnostic value and biological functions of circRNAs in PAH remain largely elusive. To study the potential roles of circRNAs in PAH, we performed microarray analysis to identify circRNAs differentially expressed between pediatric patients with PAH due to CHD and control subjects.
