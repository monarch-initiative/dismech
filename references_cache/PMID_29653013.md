Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare genetic disease caused by ciliary 
structure abnormality or dysfunction. To date, more than 21 BBS genes (BBS1 - 
21) have been reported to independently cause the disorder. Although the 
cellular functions of BBS proteins are not yet fully understood, model organisms 
have revealed that such proteins are involved in ciliary functions and 
intracellular transport. Among the 21 BBS genes, BBS7 is unique in that its 
product is a subunit of the BBSome and can directly interact with the BBS 
chaperonin complex. Previous studies using animal models showed that BBS7 
mutation can cause similar phenotypes to human patients, and human disease 
caused by BBS7 variants are special and more complex. This article reviewed 
recent progresses on BBS7.
