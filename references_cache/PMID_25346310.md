Whipple's disease (WD) is a rare, chronic, systemic infection caused by the 
bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. New molecular techniques and epidemiological data 
over the latest decade have contributed to better understanding of this 
infection. The classical form of WD is characterized by arthritis followed years 
after by diarrhoea, weight loss and malabsorption but other clinical forms 
without intestinal involvement have been described. Prompt recognition and 
treatment of the infection is important, as the disease can be fatal if 
untreated. New studies are required to establish the optimal therapy regimen.
