Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare inherited disease with impaired 
mucociliary clearance. Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) are commonly 
recommended for patients with PCD to facilitate mucus clearance, despite a lack 
of evidence in this group. Current physiotherapy practice in PCD is based on 
evidence extrapolated from the field of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). This paper focuses 
on the available evidence and outlines challenges in extrapolating evidence 
between the conditions for best clinical practice.
