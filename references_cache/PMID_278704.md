Prevalence of taurodontism found in radiographic dental examination of 1,200 
young adult Israeli patients.

Shifman A, Chanannel I.

The prevalence of taurodontism was studied radiographically in 1,200 young adult 
Israeli patients. In order to differentiate taurodont teeth from normal teeth, 
three types of taurodontism (meso-, hypo- and hypertaudodontism) were defined in 
biometric terms, using radiographic features of molar morphology. All three 
types according to Shaw's classification were seen. Taurodontism was found to 
occur in 5.6% of 1,200 individuals and in 1.5% of the 10,204 molar teeth 
examined. The mandibular second molar was found to be the most prone, being 
involved in two thirds of all cases found. Hypertaurodontism was found only in 
three cases, in the third molars. The conditions was seen to involve single and 
multiple teeth, both unilaterally and bilaterally, with the latter being most 
predominant.
