Modeling of an interface between isorefractive media by a resistive surface.

Basdemir HD.

In this study, the scattering of plane waves by a half-plane with different face 
impedances, which lie between isorefractive media, is analyzed. A new approach 
for the solution of this scenario is proposed. According to this proposal, the 
problem of isorefractive media and an impedance half-plane is modeled by a 
junction of resistive and impedance sheets. Thus the diffraction coefficient of 
the construction is obtained with the aid of the equivalent problem. The uniform 
expression of the diffracted waves is derived by the method of the uniform 
theory of diffraction. The scattered and diffracted waves are investigated 
numerically.
