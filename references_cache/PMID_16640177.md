According to its superficial anatomical location the thyroid gland is easily 
accessible by sonography. Ultrasound is a reliable examination to detect various 
pathologies of the thyroid gland and it should always be combined with a 
sonography of the surrounding soft tissues and vessels. Sonography allows an 
exact documentation of the size, volume and parenchymal echostructure of the 
thyroid gland as well as detection of various diffuse and focal abnormalities of 
the gland itself and of the surrounding structures. The presented article gives 
an overview of the sonographic diagnoses and differential diagnoses of various 
diffuse and focal pathologies of the thyroid gland as well as some 
recommendations regarding their possible further diagnostic approach.
