Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomal dominant condition 
characterized by hamartomatous polyps, primarily in the gastrointestinal tract 
and mucocutaneous pigmented macules. PJS patients are at an increased lifetime 
risk of malignancies and complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding from 
polyposis. Routine screening is critical in patients diagnosed with PJS in order 
to avoid complications. We report a case of a 30-year-old female with PJS who 
had no family history presenting acutely due to gastrointestinal bleeding and 
poor surveillance of her condition.
