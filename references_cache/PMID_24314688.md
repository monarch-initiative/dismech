Before the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), evoked potentials 
(EPs)-visual evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials, and brain stem 
auditory evoked responses-were commonly used to determine a second site of 
disease in patients being evaluated for possible multiple sclerosis (MS). The 
identification of an area of the central nervous system showing abnormal 
conduction was used to supplement the abnormal signs identified on the physical 
examination-thus identifying the "multiple" in MS. This article is a brief 
overview of additional ways in which central nervous system (CNS) physiology-as 
measured by EPs-can still contribute value in the management of MS in the era of 
MRIs.
