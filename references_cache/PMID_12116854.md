Parvovirus B19 is a human erythrovirus, i.e. which induces the death of 
erythroid progenitors. In such cells, until now only ubiquitous transcription 
factors have been described to regulate promoter driven gene expression. Their 
possible interactions with erythroid specific transcription factors merit 
further investigations. Effectively, the high level of replication of B19 in 
erythroid cells is not well understood. In addition to apoptosis, necrosis or 
inhibition of cell growth, the death of B19 infected erythroid progenitors has 
been never clearly reported as the result of immunological attack: this mecanism 
will merit further investigations. The interactions with other cell types in 
vitro remain at present not well defined but many obstacles have been mentioned 
which counteract B19 expression.
