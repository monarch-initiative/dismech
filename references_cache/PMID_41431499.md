Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by several Plasmodium species, transmitted 
through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, and capable of causing mild 
to life-threatening illness. In non-endemic areas, sporadic cases present a 
significant diagnostic challenge, where delay in recognition can lead to severe 
outcomes and death. In this case report, we present a rare case of locally 
acquired P. falciparum malaria in Lebanon, in a 70-year-old Lebanese female with 
no history of travel to endemic regions, who presented with intermittent fever, 
chills, headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory tests showed anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Microscopic investigations on peripheral blood 
smear revealed intraerythrocytic ring forms, and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) 
confirmed P. falciparum infection. Given the patient's age and high parasitemia, 
she was treated with intravenous artesunate, followed by oral 
artemether-lumefantrine, and subsequently made a full recovery. The absence of 
conventional exposure routes, such as travel, blood transfusion, or organ 
transplant, makes this case a significant diagnostic and public health 
challenge. This case highlights the need for sustained malaria surveillance 
and heightened awareness among clinicians in historically non-endemic areas.
