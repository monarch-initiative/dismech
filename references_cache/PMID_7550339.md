A gene (PEX) with homologies to endopeptidases is mutated in patients with 
X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. The HYP Consortium.

[No authors listed]

X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (HYP) is a dominant disorder characterised by 
impaired phosphate uptake in the kidney, which is likely to be caused by 
abnormal regulation of sodium phosphate cotransport in the proximal tubules. By 
positional cloning, we have isolated a candidate gene from the HYP region in 
Xp22.1. This gene exhibits homology to a family of endopeptidase genes, members 
of which are involved in the degradation or activation of a variety of peptide 
hormones. This gene (which we have called PEX) is composed of multiple exons 
which span at least five cosmids. Intragenic non-overlapping deletions from four 
different families and three mutations (two splice sites and one frameshift) 
have been detected in HYP patients, which suggest that the PEX gene is involved 
in the HYP disorder.
