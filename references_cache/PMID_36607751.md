Quinn A, Pulsipher K, Szeto M, Presley C, Marroquin N, Dellavalle R.

Monkeypox has infected over 18,000 individuals in the United States since the 
first reported case on May 17, 2022.1 Monkeypox is a variola poxvirus that is 
related to smallpox, but monkeypox symptoms (fever, painful vesicular or 
pustular rash, and lymphadenopathy) are milder and fatalities are rare.
