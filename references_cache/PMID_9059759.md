Primary progressive aphasia is an important recently emphasized clinical 
syndrome that is a common early manifestation of Pick's disease and Pick complex 
pathology. It is defined clinically as slowly progressive language disturbance 
that remains relatively isolated from other cognitive or behavioral deficits for 
at least 2 years. Subsequently, it may become associated with behavioral changes 
similar to those in frontal lobe dementia (FLD), extrapyramidal manifestations, 
and apraxia similar to corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and with motor neuron 
disease. Both the common nonfluent or logopenic variety leading to mutism 
(frontal involvement) and fluent or semantic varieties (temporal involvement) 
are recognized. Neuroimaging with CT, MRI, and SPECT are useful adjuncts 
confirming the diagnosis. PPA is a manifestation of frontotemporal degeneration 
or Pick complex, which is probably the second most common degenerative dementia 
after AD.
