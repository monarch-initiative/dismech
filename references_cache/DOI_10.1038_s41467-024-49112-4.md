## Content

AbstractThis study investigates the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the context of Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) lytic infection. We employ two sequencing technologies, short-read sequencing and long-read sequencing, following RNase R treatment on VZV-infected neuroblastoma cells to identify and characterize both cellular and viral circRNAs. Our large scanning analysis identifies and subsequent experiments confirm 200 VZV circRNAs. Moreover, we discover numerous VZV latency-associated transcripts (VLTs)-like circRNAs (circVLTslytic), which contain multiple exons and different isoforms within the same back-splicing breakpoint. To understand the functional significance of these circVLTslytic, we utilize the Bacteria Artificial Chromosome system to disrupt the expression of viral circRNAs in genomic DNA location. We reveal that the sequence flanking circVLTs’ 5’ splice donor plays a pivotal role as a cis-acting element in the formation of circVLTslytic. The circVLTslytic is dispensable for VZV replication, but the mutation downstream of circVLTslytic exon 5 leads to increased acyclovir sensitivity in VZV infection models. This suggests that circVLTslytic may have a role in modulating the sensitivity to antiviral treatment. The findings shed new insight into the regulation of cellular and viral transcription during VZV lytic infection, emphasizing the intricate interplay between circRNAs and viral processes.
