Mosquitoes are important vectors for pathogens that infect humans and other 
vertebrate animals. Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology 
play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to 
transmit pathogens. Here, we re-examine factors affecting the transmission of 
pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this 
framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult 
mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework 
for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and 
Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to 
build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in 
exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point 
processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is 
the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific 
set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen 
development are one possible part of a mosquito's state, that is not our main 
focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show 
that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple 
behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that 
relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have 
profound consequences for mosquito populations' capacity to transmit pathogens.
