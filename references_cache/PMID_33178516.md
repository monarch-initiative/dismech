Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, multi-organ disorder found 
predominantly among Caucasians. It classically presents in childhood with 
chronic productive cough, malabsorption causing steatorrhea, and failure to 
thrive. We present a 75-year-old female diagnosed with CF at the age of 57 
years, which highlights the natural history and challenges in the diagnosis of 
atypical CF, including broadening physicians' respiratory differential 
diagnosis, limited patient symptoms, and late age of symptom onset.
