Raynaud's phenomenon is a peripheral vascular disorder characterized by 
exaggerated vasoconstrictive response to certain stimuli, most typically cold 
exposure and emotional stress. Interestingly, Raynaud's phenomenon incidence is 
significantly higher in premenopausal females compared to age-matched males, 
highlighting a role of the female hormone, estrogen, in Raynaud's phenomenon 
pathogenesis. Indeed, estrogen plays a fundamental role in potentiating the 
expression and function of α2C adrenoceptor (α2C-AR), the sole mediator of local 
cooling-induced vasoconstriction. Due to the mosaic nature of Raynaud's 
phenomenon involving vascular, hormonal, and neuronal factors, as well as due to 
the lack of an appropriate animal model, the pathogenesis of Raynaud's 
phenomenon is not fully elucidated. Consequently, despite various therapeutic 
approaches aimed at mitigating symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon, a definitive 
treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon is quite challenging and remains an unmet 
need. Therefore, a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic 
mechanisms of Raynaud's phenomenon is crucial to better delineate 
pharmacotherapeutic targets to help fight this elusive disease. In this paper, 
we dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Raynaud's phenomenon 
and its risk factors, and we shed more light on the role of estrogen. We also 
explore traditional and current therapeutic approaches, including pharmacologic 
and non-pharmacologic treatments. In addition, we discuss how the advancement in 
molecular research offered promising avenues of Raynaud's phenomenon treatment, 
namely drug repurposing and molecular targeting. Nonetheless, enhanced 
awareness, precaution, and good patient compliance are critically important in 
preventing the progression of Raynaud's phenomenon and reducing its severity.
