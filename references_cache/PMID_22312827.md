Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic syndrome with unknown etiology 
and polymorphic clinical picture occurring mainly in women. The patients have 
immunological abnormalities such as autoantibodies against nuclear structures. 
The prognosis has improved due to active early diagnostics and more efficient 
treatment of the disease. Mild forms of the disease are associated with fatigue, 
articular and muscular symptoms, skin rashes, pleuritis or pericarditis and 
minor changes in the blood. Severe SLE involves glomerulonephritis, 
complications in the central nervous system, cardiac and pulmonary complications 
and major changes in the blood.
