OBJECTIVES: Cadmium exposure's impact on adolescent liver health is of concern. 
This study aimed to explore the association between cadmium exposure and liver 
health in adolescents.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from NHANES 
2017-2020.3. Urinary cadmium concentration was used as an indicator of exposure. 
Liver ultrasound parameters, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and 
stiffness (E) (STF), were employed to assess the degree of liver steatosis and 
fibrosis in adolescents. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses 
were performed to examine the correlations between cadmium exposure and liver 
health. Mediation analysis was utilized to explore the roles of alkaline 
phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive 
protein, and creatinine. Additionally, a restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis 
was conducted to evaluate the impact of nutritional intake on liver health in 
high-cadmium exposure groups.
RESULTS: Cadmium exposure levels were associated with ethnicity and family 
income. Regression analysis showed a negative correlation with CAP and a 
positive correlation with STF. Mediation analysis demonstrated that creatinine 
and triglycerides partially mediated cadmium's effect on CAP, while only 
creatinine mediated the effect on STF. Dietary intake, including eicosadienoic 
acid and theobromine, significantly impacts liver health in adolescents with 
high cadmium exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Cadmium exposure affects liver health by inhibiting steatosis and 
promoting fibrosis, with renal and lipid metabolism factors acting as mediators, 
and diet influencing the outcomes.
