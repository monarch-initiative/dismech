## Content

Clostridioides difficile is the main causative agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in hospitals in the developed world. Both infected patients and asymptomatic colonized individuals represent important transmission sources of C. difficile. C. difficile infection (CDI) shows a large range of symptoms, from mild diarrhea to severe manifestations such as pseudomembranous colitis. Epidemiological changes in CDIs have been observed in the last two decades, with the emergence of highly virulent types and more numerous and severe CDI cases in the community. C. difficile interacts with the gut microbiota throughout its entire life cycle, and the C. difficile’s role as colonizer or invader largely depends on alterations in the gut microbiota, which C. difficile itself can promote and maintain. The restoration of the gut microbiota to a healthy state is considered potentially effective for the prevention and treatment of CDI. Besides a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), many other approaches to re-establishing intestinal eubiosis are currently under investigation. This review aims to explore current data on C. difficile and gut microbiota changes in colonized individuals and infected patients with a consideration of the recent emergence of highly virulent C. difficile types, with an overview of the microbial interventions used to restore the human gut microbiota.
