Two adult brothers, one documented to have methylmalonic acidemia with 
homocystinuria, or cobalamin C deficiency, after autopsy, displayed severe but 
divergent neurological presentations. One exhibited a myelopathy and the other 
chronic endocrine problems (Schmidt's syndrome) followed by a neuropsychiatric 
and dementing disorder owing to cerebral perivascular demyelination. The 
recognition of cobalamin C deficiency has practical implications because it is 
one of the few inherited diseases of central white matter that is treatable.
