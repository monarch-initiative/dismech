Glaucoma refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders that involve retinal 
ganglion cell death, optic nerve damage, and loss of visual field. Glaucoma is a 
leading cause of vision loss worldwide, affecting an estimated 67 million 
people. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor for glaucoma. 
Individuals with malformations of structures of the anterior segment of the eye 
frequently develop elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma. In this review, 
we focus on the developmental glaucomas, the subset of glaucomas associated with 
anterior segment dysgenesis. To minimize overlap with other reviews in this 
issue and elsewhere, we highlight the complex, multifactorial nature of these 
diseases and recent advances using mice.
