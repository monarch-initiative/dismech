Addison's disease is an uncommon endocrine condition manifested by a variety of 
nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise, anorexia and nausea. Symptoms usually do 
not occur until most of the adrenal gland has been destroyed. Autoimmune disease 
has surpassed tuberculosis as the primary cause of Addison's disease. 
Nevertheless, tuberculosis still accounts for a significant proportion of cases. 
The rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is useful for 
identifying adrenal insufficiency. Maintenance therapy consists of 
hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.
