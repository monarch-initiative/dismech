IMPORTANCE: Bacterial meningitis is a worldwide health problem, with incidence 
rates ranging from approximately 0.9 per 100 000 individuals per year in 
high-income countries to 80 per 100 000 individuals per year in low-income 
countries. In low-income countries, bacterial meningitis has a mortality rate of 
up to 54%. Up to 24% of those who survive develop chronic neurological sequelae, 
such as hearing loss or focal neurological deficits.
OBSERVATIONS: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes about 72% and Neisseria 
meningitidis causes about 11% of cases of bacterial meningitis in people older 
than 16 years. Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae cause about 35% of 
cases of early-onset neonatal meningitis. In adults, risk factors for bacterial 
meningitis include older age and immunosuppressive conditions. The most common 
symptoms are headache (84%), fever (74%), stiff neck (74%), altered mental 
status (median [IQR] Glasgow Coma Scale score of 11 [9-14] on a scale ranging 
from 3-15), and nausea (62%). Brain imaging should be performed before lumbar 
puncture if patients present with altered mental status, focal neurological 
deficits, papilledema, or history of immunocompromising conditions or central 
nervous system disease. Bacterial meningitis should be suspected if any of the 
following are present on admission: serum leukocytes greater than 10.0 ×109/L, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocytes greater than 2000/μL, CSF granulocytes 
greater than 1180/μL, CSF protein greater than 2.2 g/L, CSF glucose less than 
34.23 mg/dL, or fever. A positive Gram stain result for bacteria is diagnostic, 
but the sensitivity of a positive Gram stain result for bacterial meningitis 
ranges from 50% to 90%. In countries in which the prevalence of 
ceftriaxone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae exceeds 1%, vancomycin and 
ceftriaxone are the empirical antibiotics of choice, with the addition of 
ampicillin in neonates, older patients, and immunocompromised patients. 
Adjunctive dexamethasone should be used in patients with bacterial meningitis 
but stopped if Listeria monocytogenes is confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bacterial meningitis affects approximately 0.9 per 
100 000 individuals to 80 per 100 000 individuals per year and has a mortality 
rate as high as 54%. First-line therapy is prompt empirical intravenous 
antibiotic therapy and adjunctive dexamethasone.
