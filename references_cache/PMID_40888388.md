Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare congenital ichthyosis caused by 
loss-of-function mutations in the SPINK5 gene, leading to defective expression 
of the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI. Dysregulated epidermal protease activity 
results in impaired skin barrier function and chronic inflammation, accompanied 
by complex immune profiles. NS patients commonly show activation of the 
inflammatory axis, centered on IL-17 and IL-36, in the skin and blood, and show 
a psoriasis-like shift to Th17. Conversely, the immune profile differs depending 
on the clinical type, with ichthyosis linearis circumflexa type characterized by 
complement activation and Th2-type allergic responses, and scaly erythroderma 
type characterized by a type I IFN signature and Th9-type allergic responses. 
While symptomatic treatments such as emollients and topical corticosteroids have 
been the mainstay of care, recent advances have opened new therapeutic avenues 
involving biologic agents and oral small-molecule immunomodulators. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of the current clinical landscape and future 
directions of biologics (e.g., dupilumab, secukinumab, ustekinumab) and 
small-molecule therapies (e.g., JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib, baricitinib, 
and upadacitinib) in the treatment of NS. Though evidence remains limited to 
case reports and small series, preliminary data suggest that cytokine-targeted 
interventions-particularly those inhibiting IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, IL-36, and JAK 
pathways-may offer tangible clinical benefits. Well-designed clinical trials and 
mechanistic investigations are crucial to establishing their place in NS 
management.
