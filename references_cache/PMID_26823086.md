Klinefelter's syndrome, the most common sex disorder associated with chromosomal 
aberrations, is characterized by a plethora of clinical features. Parameters for 
diagnosis of the syndrome are constantly expanding as new anatomical and 
hormonal abnormalities are noted, yet Klinefelter's remains underdiagnosed and 
underreported. This review outlines the key anatomical characteristics 
associated with the syndrome, which are currently used for clinical diagnosis, 
or may provide means for improving diagnosis in the future. Clin. Anat.
