In the original revue the problematic of Meckel's diverticulum and its 
complications is presented. Questions of the disease story, anatomy and 
embryology are described. The complications-analysis of Meckel's diverticulum is 
realized and the possibilities of diagnostic procedures and therapeutic 
modalities at the symptomatic and asymptomatic diverticulum are discussed.
