Abstract

                  Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction is associated with the pathology of a wide range of human diseases including myopathies and muscular atrophy. However, the mechanistic understanding of specific components on the regulation of protein turnover during development and disease progression in skeletal muscle is unclear. Mutations in
                  KLHL40
                  , an E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin3 (CUL3) substrate-specific adapter protein result in a severe form of congenital nemaline myopathy, but the events that initiate the pathology and the mechanism through which it becomes pervasive, remains poorly understood. To characterize the KLHL40-regulated ubiquitin modified proteome during skeletal muscle development and disease onset, we used global, quantitative mass spectrometry-based ubiquitylome and global proteome analyses of
                  klhl40
                  mutant zebrafish during disease progression. Global proteomics during skeletal muscle development revealed extensive remodeling of functional modules linked with sarcomere formation, energy and biosynthetic metabolic processes and vesicle trafficking. Combined analysis of
                  klh40
                  mutant muscle proteome and ubiquitylome identified thin filament proteins, metabolic enzymes and ER-Golgi vesicle trafficking pathway proteins regulated by ubiquitylation during muscle development. Our studies identified a role for KLHL40 as a negative regulator of ER-Golgi anterograde trafficking through ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation of secretion associated Ras related GTPase1a (Sar1a). In KLHL40 deficient muscle, defects in ER exit site vesicle formation alter Golgi compartment and downstream transport of extracellular cargo proteins, resulting in structural and functional abnormalities. Our work reveals that the muscle proteome is dynamically fine-tuned by ubiquitylation to regulate skeletal muscle development and uncovers new disease mechanisms for therapeutic development in patients.
