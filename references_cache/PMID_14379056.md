The surgical treatment of melanoma.

POLLACK RS.

Some melanomas arise from compound and junctional nevi. Since there is a 
relatively high incidence of malignant diseases on the soles of the feet and the 
genitalia, routine removal of nevi developing in those areas is 
recommended."Juvenile melanomas" are active, cellular nevi occurring in 
prepubertal children. The clinical course is probably benign. The tenet of 
excision and dissection in continuity where feasible of the primary melanoma and 
the regional lymph nodes is reemphasized. When continuous dissection is not 
possible, regional node dissection is recommended as a separate procedure. Major 
amputations for melanomas of the extremities are not recommended for the usual 
case.
