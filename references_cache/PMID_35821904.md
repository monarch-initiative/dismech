Ludwig's angina is a bacterial infection of the tongue and floor of the mouth. 
It can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Treatment includes IV 
antibiotics and, in some cases, surgical intervention. In this report, we 
describe a case with an unusual presentation. Early recognition of the condition 
in such cases is vital to prevent potential complications.
LEARNING POINTS: Ludwig's angina, even though a well-established clinical 
entity, can be hard to recognize clinically.Early recognition of the condition 
is vital for the prevention of complications.A low threshold for surgical 
treatment should be maintained when surgery is indicated.
