Bird fancier's lung (BFL) is a subtype of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), an 
immune-mediated interstitial lung disease (ILD) resulting from the repeated 
inhalation of avian proteins found in bird droppings, feathers, and serum. 
Diagnosing BFL is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms that overlap with 
other ILDs like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis. This complexity 
is heightened during pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
where respiratory symptoms may be misattributed to severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, leading to diagnostic anchoring 
and delays in appropriate management. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) 
is pivotal in detecting subtle pulmonary changes, characteristic of HP, 
surpassing standard chest radiographs. We present the case of a 43-year-old male 
pigeon keeper with an eight-week history of progressive dyspnea on exertion and 
intermittent chest pain. Despite unremarkable chest X-rays, HRCT revealed 
bilateral diffuse centrilobular nodules, patchy ground-glass opacities, and a 
mosaic attenuation pattern without fibrosis, consistent with acute HP. A 
thorough occupational history uncovered significant avian antigen exposure, and 
a family history suggested genetic susceptibility. The patient was diagnosed 
with BFL and treated with a tapering regimen of oral corticosteroids, starting 
at 40 mg/day. He was advised to cease pigeon keeping and avoid future avian 
exposure. Significant symptomatic improvement occurred within three months. 
Follow-up imaging over one year confirmed stable lung parenchyma with no disease 
progression or recurrence. This case underscores the importance of incorporating 
detailed occupational histories and utilizing advanced imaging modalities like 
HRCT when standard imaging is inconclusive. Early identification and 
intervention are crucial to prevent progression to chronic HP and irreversible 
fibrosis. Management should focus on reducing inflammation with corticosteroids 
and implementing strict environmental controls to prevent re-exposure. Long-term 
follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence and maintain remission. 
Clinicians should remain vigilant for alternative diagnoses during pandemics to 
avoid diagnostic anchoring. This case contributes to the evidence supporting 
HRCT's critical role in early HP detection and emphasizes heightened clinical 
awareness of occupational lung diseases. A multidisciplinary approach involving 
pulmonologists, radiologists, and occupational medicine specialists is key to 
optimizing outcomes in HP and other ILDs.
