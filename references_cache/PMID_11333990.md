BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because 
of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether 
type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of 
subjects at high risk for the disease is not known.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 
350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided 
by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to 
either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the 
intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, 
total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber 
and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; 
the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean duration of 
follow-up was 3.2 years.
RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of 
year 1 was 4.2+/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-3.7 kg in the 
control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+/-5.5 kg in the 
intervention group and 0.8+/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons between the groups). The cumulative incidence of diabetes after four 
years was 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 15 percent) in the 
intervention group and 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 29 
percent) in the control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was 
reduced by 58 percent (P<0.001) in the intervention group. The reduction in the 
incidence of diabetes was directly associated with changes in lifestyle.
CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of 
high-risk subjects.
