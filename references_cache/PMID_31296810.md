Lynch syndrome is one of the most common inherited predisposition syndromes 
which demonstrated autosomal dominant manner and is associated with increased 
risks of colorectal and endometrial cancer, as well as multiple other cancer 
types. Lynch syndrome is caused by germline pathogenic variants in any of 4 DNA 
mismatch repair(MMR)genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 and rarely in the non-MMR 
gene EPCAM, in which deletion of its last exon induce epigenetic silencing of 
MSH2. Resent advances have been occurred in our understanding of the 
epidemiology of this disease and the advent of multigene panel tests brought 
more understanding of the pathogenesis of neoplasia in the setting of Lynch 
syndrome and these advances have important implications of prevention, 
risk-reduction and immunotherapy.
