# Phase 1/2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Pulse Dosed Ceftriaxone for Post-Treatment Lyme Disease

## Content

Lyme disease is a public health crisis in the US. It is estimated that over 400,000 cases occur every year with 10-20% of those infected going on to develop Post-Treatment Lyme disease Syndrome (PTLDS). The goal of this study is to investigate if giving Ceftriaxone every 5 days for about 6 weeks kills the organism that produces persistent Lyme infection.

Enrolled participants will be randomized 1:1 receiving either pulse-dosed ceftriaxone or placebo \[dextrose (5% in water), (D5W)\], intravenously. Participants will be evaluated at each of the study visits, and then in a follow-up phase out to 12 months. They will be unblinded at 6 months and those randomized to the placebo group will be offered pulse-dosed ceftriaxone on the same schedule as those randomized to the drug group. All patients will be followed up for a total of 12 months post treatment initiation.
