The expanding clinical utilization of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in 
oncology has brought increasing attention to thyroid dysfunction as a prominent 
immune-related adverse event (irAE). Elucidating the pathophysiological 
mechanisms underlying ICI-induced thyroiditis represents a critical step toward 
developing evidence-based diagnostic protocols and targeted therapeutic 
interventions for cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. This comprehensive 
review systematically examines current advances in understanding the 
etiopathogenesis of ICI-induced thyroiditis. First, we described pharmacological 
characterization of ICIs, then discussed multifactorial analysis of cellular and 
molecular contributors to thyroid autoimmunity following ICI administration and 
finally analyzed critical evaluation of emerging hypotheses regarding primary 
pathogenic drivers. Through this review, we aim to establish mechanistic 
connections between ICI pharmacodynamics and thyroid tissue immunopathology.
