BACKGROUND: There is a clinical need for therapeutics for COVID-19 patients with 
acute hypoxemic respiratory failure whose 60-day mortality remains at 30-50%. 
Aviptadil, a lung-protective neuropeptide, and remdesivir, a nucleotide prodrug 
of an adenosine analog, were compared with placebo among patients with COVID-19 
acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure.
METHODS: TESICO was a randomised trial of aviptadil and remdesivir versus 
placebo at 28 sites in the USA. Hospitalised adult patients were eligible for 
the study if they had acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and were within 4 days of the onset of respiratory failure. 
Participants could be randomly assigned to both study treatments in a 2 × 2 
factorial design or to just one of the agents. Participants were randomly 
assigned with a web-based application. For each site, randomisation was 
stratified by disease severity (high-flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive 
ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation [ECMO]), and four strata were defined by remdesivir and aviptadil 
eligibility, as follows: (1) eligible for randomisation to aviptadil and 
remdesivir in the 2 × 2 factorial design; participants were equally randomly 
assigned (1:1:1:1) to intravenous aviptadil plus remdesivir, aviptadil plus 
remdesivir matched placebo, aviptadil matched placebo plus remdesvir, or 
aviptadil placebo plus remdesivir placebo; (2) eligible for randomisation to 
aviptadil only because remdesivir was started before randomisation; (3) eligible 
for randomisation to aviptadil only because remdesivir was contraindicated; and 
(4) eligible for randomisation to remdesivir only because aviptadil was 
contraindicated. For participants in strata 2-4, randomisation was 1:1 to the 
active agent or matched placebo. Aviptadil was administered as a daily 12-h 
infusion for 3 days, targeting 600 pmol/kg on infusion day 1, 1200 pmol/kg on 
day 2, and 1800 pmol/kg on day 3. Remdesivir was administered as a 200 mg 
loading dose, followed by 100 mg daily maintenance doses for up to a 10-day 
total course. For participants assigned to placebo for either agent, matched 
saline placebo was administered in identical volumes. For both treatment 
comparisons, the primary outcome, assessed at day 90, was a six-category ordinal 
outcome: (1) at home (defined as the type of residence before hospitalisation) 
and off oxygen (recovered) for at least 77 days, (2) at home and off oxygen for 
49-76 days, (3) at home and off oxygen for 1-48 days, (4) not hospitalised but 
either on supplemental oxygen or not at home, (5) hospitalised or in hospice 
care, or (6) dead. Mortality up to day 90 was a key secondary outcome. The 
independent data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the aviptadil 
trial on May 25, 2022, for futility. On June 9, 2022, the sponsor stopped the 
trial of remdesivir due to slow enrolment. The trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04843761.
FINDINGS: Between April 21, 2021, and May 24, 2022, we enrolled 473 participants 
in the study. For the aviptadil comparison, 471 participants were randomly 
assigned to aviptadil or matched placebo. The modified intention-to-treat 
population comprised 461 participants who received at least a partial infusion 
of aviptadil (231 participants) or aviptadil matched placebo (230 participants). 
For the remdesivir comparison, 87 participants were randomly assigned to 
remdesivir or matched placebo and all received some infusion of remdesivir (44 
participants) or remdesivir matched placebo (43 participants). 85 participants 
were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses for both agents (ie, 
those enrolled in the 2 x 2 factorial). For the aviptadil versus placebo 
comparison, the median age was 57 years (IQR 46-66), 178 (39%) of 461 
participants were female, and 246 (53%) were Black, Hispanic, Asian or other (vs 
215 [47%] White participants). 431 (94%) of 461 participants were in an 
intensive care unit at baseline, with 271 (59%) receiving high-flow nasal oxygen 
or non-invasive ventiliation, 185 (40%) receiving invasive mechanical 
ventilation, and five (1%) receiving ECMO. The odds ratio (OR) for being in a 
better category of the primary efficacy endpoint for aviptadil versus placebo at 
day 90, from a model stratified by baseline disease severity, was 1·11 (95% CI 
0·80-1·55; p=0·54). Up to day 90, 86 participants in the aviptadil group and 83 
in the placebo group died. The cumulative percentage who died up to day 90 was 
38% in the aviptadil group and 36% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1·04, 95% 
CI 0·77-1·41; p=0·78). The primary safety outcome of death, serious adverse 
events, organ failure, serious infection, or grade 3 or 4 adverse events up to 
day 5 occurred in 146 (63%) of 231 patients in the aviptadil group compared with 
129 (56%) of 230 participants in the placebo group (OR 1·40, 95% CI 0·94-2·08; 
p=0·10).
INTERPRETATION: Among patients with COVID-19-associated acute hypoxaemic 
respiratory failure, aviptadil did not significantly improve clinical outcomes 
up to day 90 when compared with placebo. The smaller than planned sample size 
for the remdesivir trial did not permit definitive conclusions regarding safety 
or efficacy.
