Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) is a rare disorder characterized by a 
hypercoagulable state. Manifestations include arterial or venous thrombosis, 
recurrent fetal wastage, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, 
dilated cardiomyopathy, pulmonary artery hypertension, and intracardiac 
thrombus. Most commonly mitral valve is affected followed by aortic and then 
tricuspid valve. In this report, a rare case of spontaneous aortic thrombosis 
with tricuspid stenosis uncomplicated by other valve lesions is presented with 
clinical and echocardiographic studies and computed tomographic images.
