## Content

Macular dystrophies (MDs) constitute a collection of hereditary retina disorders leading to notable visual impairment, primarily due to progressive macular atrophy. These conditions are distinguished by bilateral and relatively symmetrical abnormalities in the macula that significantly impair central visual function. Recent strides in fundus imaging, especially optical coherence tomography (OCT), have enhanced our comprehension and diagnostic capabilities for MD. OCT enables the identification of neurosensory retinal disorganization patterns and the extent of damage to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor cells in the dystrophies before visible macular pathology appears on fundus examinations. It not only helps us in diagnostic retinal and choroidal pathologies but also guides us in monitoring the progression of, staging of, and response to treatment. In this review, we summarize the key findings on OCT in some of the most common MD.
