OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate vestibular function changes in 
patients with serous labyrinthitis and to discuss the possible mechanisms 
involved.
PATIENT PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old female patient of Chinese ethnicity 
presented with progressive vestibular dysfunction and unilateral acute otitis 
media complicated by serous labyrinthitis. Upon diagnosis, systemic antibiotic 
and glucocorticoid therapy was initiated; ceftriaxone sodium (2 g) and 
dexamethasone (10 mg) were administered via intravenous infusion once daily for 
5 days, complemented by hydroxymethazoline and mometasone furoate nasal sprays 
as adjunctive antiinflammatory measures. Within a week, audiometric thresholds 
returned to normal, nystagmus intensity progressively diminished, and vertigo 
resolved entirely.
CONCLUSION: Patients with vertigo and labyrinthitis secondary to acute otitis 
media typically exhibit variable vestibular symptoms, with unidirectional 
irritative nystagmus serving as a cardinal diagnostic sign. Integration of 
audiological and vestibular function assessments, including meticulous 
surveillance of clinical evolution, is paramount to prevent misdiagnosis or 
treatment delay. The differential impacts of toxic versus inflammatory mediators 
on inner ear physiology may render early combination therapy with antibiotics 
and glucocorticoids particularly efficacious.
