BACKGROUND: Early and strict dietary management of phenylketonuria is the only 
option to prevent mental retardation. We aimed to test the efficacy of 
sapropterin, a synthetic form of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), for reduction of 
blood phenylalanine concentration.
METHODS: We enrolled 89 patients with phenylketonuria in a Phase III, 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We randomly 
assigned 42 patients to receive oral doses of sapropterin (10 mg/kg) and 47 
patients to receive placebo, once daily for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was 
mean change from baseline in concentration of phenylalanine in blood after 6 
weeks. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. The study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00104247.
FINDINGS: 88 of 89 enrolled patients received at least one dose of study drug, 
and 87 attended the week 6 visit. Mean age was 20 (SD 9.7) years. At baseline, 
mean concentration of phenylalanine in blood was 843 (300) micromol/L in 
patients assigned to receive sapropterin, and 888 (323) micromol/L in controls. 
After 6 weeks of treatment, patients given sapropterin had a decrease in mean 
blood phenylalanine of 236 (257) micromol/L, compared with a 3 (240) micromol/L 
increase in the placebo group (p<0.0001). After 6 weeks, 18/41 (44%) patients 
(95% CI 28-60) in the sapropterin group and 4/47 (9%) controls (95% CI 2-20) had 
a reduction in blood phenylalanine concentration of 30% or greater from 
baseline. Blood phenylalanine concentrations fell by about 200 micromol/L after 
1 week in the sapropterin group and this reduction persisted for the remaining 5 
weeks of the study (p<0.0001). 11/47 (23%) patients in the sapropterin group and 
8/41 (20%) in the placebo group experienced adverse events that might have been 
drug-related (p=0.80). Upper respiratory tract infections were the most common 
disorder.
INTERPRETATION: In some patients with phenylketonuria who are responsive to BH4, 
sapropterin treatment to reduce blood phenylalanine could be used as an adjunct 
to a restrictive low-phenylalanine diet, and might even replace the diet in some 
instances.
