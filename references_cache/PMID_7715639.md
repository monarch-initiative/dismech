BACKGROUND: In a previous open-label study of hydroxyurea therapy, the synthesis 
of fetal hemoglobin increased in most patients with sickle cell anemia, with 
only mild myelotoxicity. By inhibiting sickling, increased levels of fetal 
hemoglobin might decrease the frequency of painful crises.
METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, we tested the efficacy of 
hydroxyurea in reducing the frequency of painful crises in adults with a history 
of three or more such crises per year. The trial was stopped after a mean 
follow-up of 21 months.
RESULTS: Among 148 men and 151 women studied at 21 clinics, the 152 patients 
assigned to hydroxyurea treatment had lower annual rates of crises than the 147 
patients given placebo (median, 2.5 vs. 4.5 crises per year, P < 0.001). The 
median times to the first crisis (3.0 vs. 1.5 months, P = 0.01) and the second 
crisis (8.8 vs. 4.6 months, P < 0.001) were longer with hydroxyurea treatment. 
Fewer patients assigned to hydroxyurea had chest syndrome (25 vs. 51, P < 
0.001), and fewer underwent transfusions (48 vs. 73, P = 0.001). At the end of 
the study, the doses of hydroxyurea ranged from 0 to 35 mg per kilogram of body 
weight per day. Treatment with hydroxyurea did not cause any important adverse 
effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxyurea therapy can ameliorate the clinical course of sickle 
cell anemia in some adults with three or more painful crises per year. Maximal 
tolerated doses of hydroxyurea may not be necessary to achieve a therapeutic 
effect. The beneficial effects of hydroxyurea do not become manifest for several 
months, and its use must be carefully monitored. The long-term safety of 
hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell anemia is uncertain.
