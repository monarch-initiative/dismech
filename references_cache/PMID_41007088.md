Background: Refeeding syndrome is a potentially fatal complication that occurs 
in inpatient, severely acutely malnourished children during the early phase of 
nutritional management. Its early identification and management are critical to 
preventing adverse outcomes. Addressing refeeding syndrome in inpatient settings 
is critical in Sub-Saharan Africa, where severe acute malnutrition is common and 
under-researched. Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyse current 
evidence on the identification and management of refeeding syndrome in 
hospitalised severely malnourished children (6 to 59 months) in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across academic databases 
such as PubMed and the Cochrane Library, from 2010 to 2024. Articles reporting 
on the identification and management of refeeding syndrome in inpatient children 
with severe acute malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa were included. Data 
extractions were performed by two reviewers using Rayyan software. A 
meta-analysis of proportions was conducted using STATA 19. Results: Nine studies 
were included. The identification and management of refeeding syndrome were 
impacted by the lack of a standardised definition. Significant heterogeneity (Q 
= 27.17, p < 0.001) was observed, indicating a significant variation in the 
prevalence rates ranging from 8.7% to 34.8%. Management strategies varied; most 
studies adhered to World Health Organisation guidelines for severe acute 
malnutrition but lacked specific protocols for refeeding syndrome. Conclusions: 
Evidence highlights the need for standardised, evidence-based and 
context-specific protocols for refeeding syndrome in children with severe acute 
malnutrition. Early screening, electrolyte monitoring, and cautious feeding 
remain important, although current evidence is of low certainty. Future 
prospective studies are needed to develop effective management strategies.
