Ectopia lentis.

Nelson LB, Maumenee IH.

Ectopia lentis was first described more than 200 years ago, but its value as a 
significant diagnostic clue to the presence of other ocular and systemic 
disorders has only recently been appreciated. Ectopia lentis may cause a marked 
reduction in visual acuity, which varies with the type and degree of dislocation 
and the presence of other ocular abnormalities. An approach to the diagnostic 
evaluation of the patient with ectopia lentis is outlined. The differential 
diagnosis is reviewed in detail both clinically and histologically. The 
complications of ectopia lentis and the appropriate management of affected 
patients are discussed.
