Lung cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in 
China. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common histological type 
of lung cancer. Mutations of driver genes have major impacts on incidence and 
progression of lung cancer. Advances in molecular biology research and clinical 
research have promoted the discovery of rare tumor driver genes, as well as the 
development and application of new targeted drugs. Nearly 1% to 2% of NSCLCs 
harbor RET fusions, and this patient population may not respond well to 
traditional treatments like chemotherapy or radiation therapy. After the new 
highly selective RET inhibitors pralsetinib (BLU-667) and selpercatinib 
(LOXO-292) entered clinical application, the diagnosis and treatment of RET 
fusion positive NSCLC has made breakthrough progress. At present, there is a 
lack of guiding consensus on the standardized diagnosis and treatment of RET 
fusion-positive NSCLC in China. The Society of Cancer Precision of Chinese 
Anti-Cancer Association and Lung Cancer Expert Group of Chinese Medical Journal, 
invited 38 experts form respiratory medicine, medical oncology, oncology 
radiotherapy and pathology to form a consensus development group. Based on the 
existing research evidence, combined with China's clinical practice experience, 
a standardized process for the diagnosis and treatment of advanced RET 
fusion-positive NSCLC is proposed, including suitable populations and methods 
for RET gene fusion, treatment drug selection, treatment of resistance to highly 
selective RET inhibitors, and management of adverse reactions to treatment, with 
a view to providing guidance for clinicians.

肺癌是我国发病率和死亡率最高的恶性肿瘤，非小细胞肺癌(NSCLC)是最常见的肺癌组织学类型。驱动基因变异是肺癌发病和进展的重要影响因素。分子生物学的进步和临床研究进展推动了较罕见肿瘤驱动基因的发现以及新型靶向药物的开发应用。约1%~2%的NSCLC患者存在RET融合，RET融合患者经传统治疗获益有限。在靶向治疗方法进入临床使用前，晚期RET融合阳性NSCLC患者的系统治疗方法参考驱动基因阴性NSCLC以含铂双药化疗为主。新型高选择性RET抑制剂普拉替尼(Pralsetinib, 
BLU-667)和塞普替尼(Selpercatinib, 
LOXO-292)进入临床应用后，RET融合阳性NSCLC的诊疗有了突破性的进展。目前中国尚缺乏针对RET融合阳性NSCLC规范诊疗的指导性共识，中国抗癌协会肿瘤精准治疗专业委员会和中华医学会杂志社肺癌研究协作组邀请中国呼吸科、肿瘤内科、肿瘤放疗科和病理学领域的38名专家组成共识制定组，基于现有的研究证据，结合中国的临床实践经验，提出了晚期RET融合阳性NSCLC的诊疗规范流程，包括RET基因融合的适用人群和检测方法、治疗药物选择、高选择性RET抑制剂耐药后的处理，以及治疗不良反应管理，以期为临床医师提供指引。.
