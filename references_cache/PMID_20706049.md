Non-Hodgkin lymphomas quite often present in the head and neck but primary 
tonsillar lymphomas of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas are far less than 1% of 
head and neck malignancies. Reports of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) related to primary tonsillar lymphoma are seldom. A 
59-year-old man suffered from painful swelling of the bilateral tonsil. Biopsy 
diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. F-18 FDG PET/CT was performed for 
disease staging. Whole-body F-18 FDG PET/CT revealed the intense FDG uptake of 
bilateral tonsil with an additional small lymph node in the right side of the 
neck. This case also highlights the usefulness of staging and assessing therapy 
response in rare types of lymphoma.
