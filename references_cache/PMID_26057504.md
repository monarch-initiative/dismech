Vitiligo is the loss of skin pigmentation caused by autoimmune destruction of 
melanocytes. Little is known about the impact of psychological stressors 
preceding vitiligo onset on symptoms associated with vitiligo and the extent of 
disease. We performed a questionnaire-based study of 1541 adults with vitiligo 
to evaluate the impact of psychological stressors in this patient population. 
Psychological stressors should be considered as potential disease triggers in 
vitiligo patients, and screening of vitiligo patients for psychological 
stressors and associated symptoms should be included in routine assessment.
