Dermal changes in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Kobayasi T, Oguchi M, Asboe-Hansen G.

Skin biopsies from thirteen patients suffering from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 
including 6 of the mitis type, 4 of the benign hypermobile type, one of the 
X-linked type, one of the ocular type and one of the periodontitis type, were 
studied by electron microscopy after routine preparation. Collagen fibrils 
showed a distorted arrangement of bent, curled or twisted fibrils and 
thread-like material. Similar changes may be seen in the skin of other 
hereditary disorders of connective tissue. However, abnormal collagen fibrils in 
normal skin suggests one of eight types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Clinical 
variants cannot be differentiated on the basis of ultrastructural findings. 
Elastic fibres were normal without degenerative changes. Perineurium was lacking 
in dermal nerves of most patients. Fibroblast-like cells showed no cystic 
cisterna of endoplasmic reticula.
