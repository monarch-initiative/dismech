Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare autosomal dominant condition 
characterized by the dysgenesis of the anterior segment along with some systemic 
abnormalities such as dental and facial bone defects. Its incidence is thought 
to be 1 in 200,000. Treatment is predominantly the management of glaucoma and is 
mostly medical but can be surgical in refractory cases. Here, we describe the 
case of a 35-year-old female patient who presented with co-existing vernal 
keratoconjunctivitis and ARS. The treatment was more challenging as we had to 
manage two conditions simultaneously.
