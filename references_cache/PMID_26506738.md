FLUID AND HEMODYNAMIC MANAGEMENT IN SEVERE DENGUE.

Wongsa A.

In the critical phase of dengue fever, the leakage of intravascular fluid into 
interstitial space and 3rd space can cause hemoconcentration and severe 
complications such as dengue shock syndrome (DSS), and it can lead to multiple 
organ failure, followed by death. Close monitoring, early detection and prompt 
management are the keys in successful treatment. In a hemodynamically unstable 
patient, crystalloid is the fluid of choice in initial management. However, if 
they are not responsive despite adequate resuscitation, a careful search for 
others causes is mandatory and fluids should be switched from crystalloid to 
colloid. If the leakage leads to restriction of the use of fluids (pulmonary 
edema), the addition of a vasopressor such as norepinephrine needs to be 
considered. After stabilizing the hemodynamics and clinical improvement, the 
physician has to know when to reduce and discontinue the fluid to avoid 
congestion and others complications.
