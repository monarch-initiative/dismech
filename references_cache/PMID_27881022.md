CONTEXT: YKL-40 is an inflammatory biomarker for endothelial dysfunction that 
may have a role in Kawasaki disease (KD).
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association of serum YKL-40 levels with KD and 
established laboratory parameters for YKL-40 levels and other inflammatory 
markers.
METHODS: YKL-40 levels and other inflammatory markers of 23 KD patients, 9 
disease control patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls.
RESULTS: YKL-40 concentration in the serum of KD patients significantly 
increased during the acute disease phase compared with those of disease controls 
and healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased YKL-40 levels may provide a useful inflammatory marker 
for patients with KD.
