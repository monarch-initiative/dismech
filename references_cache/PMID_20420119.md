A significant expansion of knowledge in the last few years, especially in the 
molecular biology of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is summarized. This 
condition, formerly known as Pick's disease and considered rare, is estimated to 
be 12-15% of all dementias and 30-50% early onset ones. The clinical picture is 
protean, mainly a behavioural and language impairment, but the extrapyramidal 
syndromes of CBD and PSP also belong. These seemingly different presentations 
converge, as one or other areas in the brain are affected. Less than half of the 
cases are tauopathies, the majority has been discovered to have a TDP-43 and 
most recently a FUS proteinopathy, shared with ALS, opening potential 
opportunities for pharmacological approaches to treatment. Tau and progranulin 
mutations on Ch-17 and some others, point to molecular mechanisms. A glossary is 
provided to navigate the complex terminology.
