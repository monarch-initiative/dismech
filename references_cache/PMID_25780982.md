The current Ebola outbreak has drawn attention to the virus in the medical 
community. Zaire ebolavirus, more commonly known as 'the Ebola virus,' is a 
level 4-security agent in the Filoviridae family. The main cutaneous finding of 
Ebola is a nonspecific maculopapular rash that appears between day four and six 
of disease. Patients have "ghost-like" features, and the rash initially presents 
on the upper arms, flexor forearms, and upper legs, sometimes in a centripetal 
fashion. Skin biopsy, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and electron microscopy can 
help provide early diagnosis and conceivably prevent spread if proper 
precautionary measures are in place.
