Understanding the Relationship Between Asthma and Sleep in the Pediatric 
Population.

Banasiak NC.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 9.5% of children 
have been diagnosed with asthma. Sleep disturbances affect 20% to 30% of the 
pediatric population. The prevalence of nocturnal symptoms of asthma is high, 
and most children regularly experience nighttime symptoms. Sleep is important 
for growth and development, and untreated sleep disturbances have adverse 
effects on school performance, mental health, physical health, and functioning. 
This review will explore the relationship between asthma and sleep disturbances. 
Clinicians need to assess children with asthma for sleep disturbance.
