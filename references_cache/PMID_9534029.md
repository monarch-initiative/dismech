Graves' disease, one of the autoimmune thyroid diseases, is caused by the 
production of IgG autoantibodies directed against the thyrotropin receptor. 
These antibodies bind to and activate the receptor, causing the autonomous 
production of thyroid hormones. Despite recent improvements in our understanding 
of the cellular and molecular basis of autoimmunity, our currently available 
treatments for Graves' disease have remained largely unchanged over the last 50 
years. Nevertheless, new concepts in immune system regulation hold out the 
prospect in the future for intervention designed to modify, and possibly cure, 
the underlying disease process.
