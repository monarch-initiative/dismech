Vohwinkel syndrome or keratoderma hereditaria mutilans is a rare, diffuse, 
honeycombed, palmar and plantar keratosis usually accompanied by pseudoainhum 
near the distal interphalangeal creases. The syndrome is reported in three out 
of five siblings (two brothers and one sister), who developed this problem in 
early childhood.
