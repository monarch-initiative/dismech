Presentation of Kaposi's sarcoma in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

Tom LA.

Since the first reports of unusual opportunistic infections and Kaposi's Sarcoma 
(KS) in homosexual men in New York and California, attention has been focused on 
a new epidemic: The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). One manifestation 
of this disease is Kaposi's Sarcoma. Usually a rare tumor, it occurs with a high 
incidence in patients with AIDS. In this paper Kaposi's Sarcoma as it appears in 
AIDS will be examined.
