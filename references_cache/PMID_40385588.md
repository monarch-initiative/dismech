The lack of specificity in its definition is a major obstacle to both 
explanatory and therapeutic research in long COVID. It brings together, on the 
one hand, patients with severe COVID-19 who suffer the classic complications of 
prolonged hospitalization and decompensation of comorbidities and, on the other 
hand, patients with non-severe acute COVID-19 who report multiple symptoms that 
cannot be fully explained by a biomechanical model. Indeed, despite numerous 
studies, it remains unclear how persistent viral infection, immunological or 
coagulation disturbances may contribute mechanistically to long COVID. 
Nevertheless, internal medicine should be in good place to manage these 
patients. Indeed, the diversity of symptoms may evoke a broad spectrum of 
differential diagnoses that are familiar to internists. Their experience in the 
exploration of unexplained symptoms is also valuable. It can reduce the need for 
multiple consultations with specialists and unnecessary laboratory or imaging 
tests. However, long COVID diagnosis cannot be limited to the exclusion of all 
other conditions one by one. An open and non-dualistic approach is required to 
identify other mechanisms that may explain the symptoms. Based on their clinical 
experience, most French internists who responded to an opinion survey consider 
that long COVID corresponds most closely to a functional somatic disorder (FSD) 
and seek the help of specialists in mental health care to assist in the 
management of the patients in a multi-disciplinary approach. However, as with 
other FSDs, patients with long COVID are usually reluctant to be managed by 
mental health care specialists, given the very physical nature of their 
presentation. Unfortunately, most physicians are in turn reluctant to take care 
of them, due to poor knowledge about FSD, leading to management failure. 
Alternatively, a comprehensive multidisciplinary care orchestrated by an 
experienced internist is generally well-accepted. It includes providing rational 
cognitive explanations for the symptoms and support for behavioral changes 
tailored to the patient. While waiting for hypothetical randomized controlled 
trials assessing drugs with positive results, such a holistic approach has been 
successfully applied in many individuals with severe long COVID. However, its 
generalization would require a much broader training for FSD of all health care 
providers.
