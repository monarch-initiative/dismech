Objective: To analyze the ultrasonic features of tonsillar lymphoma to improve 
the diagnostic accuracy. Methods: The clinical, pathological and ultrasonic data 
of nine patients with tonsillar lymphoma confirmed by pathology at Tianjin 
Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital during June 2015 and June 2022 
were analyzed retrospectively, and the characteristics of their ultrasonic 
images were summarized. Results: All 9 cases of tonsil lymphoma were unilateral 
tonsil disease, including 4 cases on the left side and 5 cases on the right 
side. The average maximum diameter of tonsil lymphoma in 9 cases was 4.32 cm. 
There were 3 cases with simultaneous involvement of tonsil and cervical lymph 
nodes, all of which were ipsilateral lymph nodes. Gray scale ultrasound showed 
that the lesions were hypoechoic, with clear boundaries in 7 cases and unclear 
boundaries in 2 cases. The shape was full and irregular in 5 cases and oval in 4 
cases. The echo was uniform in 7 cases and uneven in 2 cases. Color Doppler 
ultrasonography showed abundant internal blood flow signal in 1 case, a little 
dotted linear internal blood flow signal in 5 cases, and no obvious internal 
blood flow signal in 3 cases. Conclusions: The ultrasonic features of tonsillar 
lymphoma include hypoechoic area, clear boundary, full shape, irregular and 
uniform internal echo, no or low linear signal of internal blood flow. 
Ultrasonography is of great value in the diagnosis of this disease and can help 
clinical decision-making.

Publisher: 目的： 分析扁桃体淋巴瘤的超声特征，提高诊断的准确性。 方法： 
回顾性分析2015年6月至2022年6月天津市肿瘤医院经病理证实的9例扁桃体淋巴瘤患者的临床、病理资料及超声特征。 结果： 
9例扁桃体淋巴瘤中，弥漫性大B细胞淋巴瘤7例，伯基特淋巴瘤2例。均为单侧扁桃体发病，左侧4例，右侧5例，平均最大径为4.32 
cm。3例伴有颈部淋巴结转移，均为同侧淋巴结。灰阶超声示，病灶形态饱满、不规则5例，呈卵圆形4例；边界清晰7例，边界不清晰2例；病灶均为低回声，回声均匀7例，回声不均匀2例。彩色多普勒血流显像示，1例病灶内部血流信号较丰富，5例病灶内部少许点线状血流信号，3例内部无明显血流信号。 
结论： 
扁桃体淋巴瘤的超声表现多形状饱满、不规则，边界清楚，病灶低回声，内部回声均匀，无血流或少许点线状血流信号。超声对扁桃体淋巴瘤的诊断具有重要价值，可为临床决策提供帮助。.
