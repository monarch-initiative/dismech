PURPOSE: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare inherited disease affecting 
collagen-rich tissues. Ocular complications have been reported such as thin 
corneas, low ocular rigidity, keratoconus, among others. The purpose of this 
study is to characterize corneal tomographic features in OI patients compared to 
unaffected patients, with particular focus on commonly studied keratoconus 
indices.
METHODS: Cross-sectional case-control study including 37 OI patients and 37 
age-matched controls. Patients and controls underwent comprehensive 
ophthalmological examination including corneal Scheimpflug tomography with a 
Pentacam HR device (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) to analyse and 
compare topometric, tomographic, pachymetric and Belin-Ambrósio Enhanced Ectasia 
Display III (BAD-D) data of both eyes of each patient.
RESULTS: Most OI patients had type I disease (n = 24; 65%) but type III-VII 
patients were also included. Two patients had clinically overt bilateral 
keratoconus. OI patients had significantly higher maximum keratometry 
(45.2 ± 2.1 vs. 43.7 ± 1.2; p = 0.0416), front and back elevation (3.0 ± 3.3 vs. 
2.1 ± 1.3, p = 0.0201; 11.1 ± 8.2 vs. 5.0 ± 3.7, p < 0.0001), index of surface 
variance (25.5 ± 13 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3; p = 0.0016), index of vertical asymmetry 
(0.21 ± 0.14 vs. 0.15 ± 0.06; p = 0.0215), index of height asymmetry (9.2 ± 14 
vs. 6.0 ± 4.5; p = 0.0421), index of height decentration (0.02 ± 0.01 vs. 
0.01 ± 0.01; p < 0.0001) and average pachymetric progression (1.01 ± 0.19 vs. 
0.88 ± 0.14; p < 0.0001) readings. Thinnest corneal thickness and maximum 
Ambrósio relational thickness were significantly lower (477 ± 52 vs. 543 ± 26; 
387 ± 95 vs. 509 ± 49; p < 0.0001). Two-thirds of OI patients had corneas with a 
minimum thickness < 500 µm. BAD-D value was significantly higher in OI patients 
(2.1 ± 1.4 vs. 0.9 ± 0.2; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: OI patients showed significant changes in corneal profiles compared 
with healthy subjects. A high proportion of patients had tomographically suspect 
corneas when using keratoconus diagnostic indices. Further studies are warranted 
to assess the true risk of corneal ectasia in OI patients.
