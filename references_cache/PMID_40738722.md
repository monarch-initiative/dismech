BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Refeeding syndrome (RS) is a potentially 
life-threatening condition character-ised by significant electrolyte and fluid 
imbalances, posing a considerable risk in patients undergoing parenteral 
nutrition (PN) therapy. This study aimed to determine the occurrence, risk 
factors, severity, and complications of RS in a teaching hospital in Malaysia.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective observational study was conducted 
using universal sampling from October to December 2023. Data were collected for 
adult patients receiving PN for more than 48 hours between July 2022 and July 
2023 at Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz.
RESULTS: Among 90 patients included, 30 (33.3%) developed RS. Upon consideration 
of interaction terms due to collinerity of variables, a statistically 
significant correlation was observed between pre-existing electrolyte 
derangements and RS occurrence (p = 0.001). Phosphate levels showed the most 
significant decline post-PN initiation (43%), followed by potassium (19%) and 
magnesium (17%), primarily within the first 24 hours. No significant 
associations were found between BMI, fasting duration, unintentional weight 
loss, or medication history and RS. However, fasting for more than five days 
(AOR 2.8, 95% CI 0.4-17.7) and ≥10% unintentional weight loss (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 
0.4-7.7) increased the likelihood of RS.
CONCLUSIONS: RS is prevalent among adult PN patients, predominantly with mild 
severity. Pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, especially in phosphate 
levels, were robust predictors. Larger studies are needed to better elucidate 
the associations between risk factors and RS in the local population.
