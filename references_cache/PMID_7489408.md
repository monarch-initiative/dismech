Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a vascular tumour that contains characteristic spindle 
cells forming slit-like spaces, may have an infectious aetiology. Recently, 
sequences of a new human herpesvirus, KSHV/HHV-8, have been identified in both 
HIV-associated and classical KS. We sought to identify the target cell of this 
virus in KS tumour tissue. Using PCR in situ hybridization (PCR-ISH) we show 
that KSHV/HHV-8 is present in the flat endothelial cells lining vascular spaces 
of KS lesions as well as in typical KS spindle cells. These findings show that 
KSHV/HHV-8 is present in the cell types thought to represent neoplastic cells in 
these lesions.
