BACKGROUND: Type 5 Diabetes Mellitus (T5DM), denoting pancreatogenic diabetes 
from fibro-inflammatory pancreatic injury, is a distinct yet under-recognised 
entity. Current WHO and ADA classifications overlook its complex, concurrent 
endocrine-exocrine failures, contributing to misdiagnosis, treatment gaps, and 
suboptimal outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: This review aims to critically analyze current scientific 
understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, metabolic consequences, 
and therapeutic needs of T5DM and suggest a precise framework of medicine that 
justifies the need for T5DM to be formally recognized as a sub-type of diabetes.
METHODS: An integrative review was conducted using recent literature on 
pancreatic pathophysiology, molecular biomarkers, radiomics, diagnostic imaging, 
glycemic control technologies, and machine learning. The focus was on the recent 
literature to elucidate the biological, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of the 
clinical studies, guidelines, and mechanistic research available from the 
publications.
KEY FINDINGS: T5DM involves loss of insulin and glucagon alongside exocrine 
pancreatic insufficiency, malnutrition, and significant glycaemic variability. A 
tiered diagnostic framework-integrating pancreatic imaging, endocrine-exocrine 
testing, autoimmune exclusion, and emerging biomarkers-enhances accuracy. 
Management requires coordinated hormonal and enzyme replacement, structured 
nutritional support, and targeted surveillance for malignancy and micronutrient 
deficits. Radiomics, quantitative imaging, and AI-driven analytics offer 
valuable tools for earlier detection, improved risk stratification, and 
personalised therapy.
CONCLUSION: T5DM warrants recognition as a distinct diabetes entity owing to its 
unique pathophysiology, clinical behaviour, and therapeutic needs. Harmonised 
diagnostic criteria, validated biomarker and imaging pathways, and multicentre 
registries are essential to integrate T5DM into global classification systems 
and advance mechanism-based, personalised care.
