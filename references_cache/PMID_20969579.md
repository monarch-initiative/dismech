A Mendelian inheritance underlies a nonnegligible proportion of hereditary 
kidney diseases, suggesting that the encoded proteins are essential for 
maintenance of the renal function. The identification of genes involved in 
congenital anomalies of the kidney and in familial forms of nephrotic syndrome 
significantly increased our understanding of the renal development and kidney 
filtration barrier physiology. This review will focus on the classical phenotype 
and clinical heterogeneity observed in the monogenic forms of these disorders. 
In addition, the role of susceptibility genes in kidney diseases with a complex 
inheritance will also be discussed.
