# Comparison of Doxycycline and Cefuroxime Axetil in Patients With Erythema Migrans

## Content

A European, prospective clinical trial in which doxycycline and cefuroxime axetil were compared in the treatment of adult patients with erythema migrans included a control group to address this question. Evaluations of patients were conducted at baseline, 14 days and 2, 6, and 12 months after enrollment. Control subjects were evaluated at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Subjective complaints that newly developed or intensified since the onset of erythema migrans or since the date of enrollment for controls were referred to as "new or increased symptoms"(NOIS).
