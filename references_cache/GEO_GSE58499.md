# Arsenic-Associated Differential DNA Methylation in Human Uroepithelial Cells

## Content

There is strong epidemiologic evidence supporting that exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure is responsible for a myriad of adverse health effects, including carcinogenesis of the bladder. This research aimed to identify novel epigenetic biomarkers of iAs exposure in target cells within a human population. Here we assessed genome-wide, gene-specific promoter DNA methylation levels assessed in exfoliated human bladder uroepithelial cells (BECs) in relationship to BEC iAs, monomethylated As (MMAs), dimethylated As (DMAs), and total As (tAs) concentrations from 46 individuals with varying levels of As exposure in Chihuahua, Mexico. These analyses identified genes with increased methylation associated with BEC iAs(III+V), MMAs(III+V), and tAs(III+V). These genes were enriched for signaling related to metabolic disease and cancer.
