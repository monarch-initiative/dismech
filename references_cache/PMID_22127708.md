OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy/safety of the B lymphocyte stimulator 
inhibitor belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard 
therapy in active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: In a phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 819 
antinuclear antibody-positive or anti-double-stranded DNA-positive SLE patients 
with scores ≥6 on the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National 
Assessment (SELENA) version of the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) were 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 mg/kg belimumab, 10 mg/kg belimumab, or 
placebo intravenously on days 0, 14, and 28 and then every 28 days for 72 weeks. 
The primary efficacy end point was the SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rate 
at week 52 (an SRI response was defined as a ≥4-point reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI 
score, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG] A organ domain score 
and no more than 1 new BILAG B score, and no worsening in physician's global 
assessment score versus baseline).
RESULTS: Belimumab at 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy met the primary efficacy 
end point, generating a significantly greater SRI response at week 52 compared 
with placebo (43.2% versus 33.5%; P = 0.017). The rate with 1 mg/kg belimumab 
was 40.6% (P = 0.089). Response rates at week 76 were 32.4%, 39.1%, and 38.5% 
with placebo, 1 mg/kg belimumab, and 10 mg/kg belimumab, respectively. In post 
hoc sensitivity analyses evaluating higher SELENA-SLEDAI score thresholds, 10 
mg/kg belimumab achieved better discrimination at weeks 52 and 76. Risk of 
severe flares over 76 weeks (based on the modified SLE Flare Index) was reduced 
with 1 mg/kg belimumab (34%) (P = 0.023) and 10 mg/kg belimumab (23%) (P = 
0.13). Serious and severe adverse events, including infections, laboratory 
abnormalities, malignancies, and deaths, were comparable across groups.
CONCLUSION: Belimumab plus standard therapy significantly improved SRI response 
rate, reduced SLE disease activity and severe flares, and was generally well 
tolerated in SLE.
