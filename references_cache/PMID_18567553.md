Findings from estrogen-resistant and aromatase-deficient men have provided 
important insights into the role of estrogen in the male skeleton during growth. 
Importantly, as reported elsewhere in this issue, these data also suggested 
dose-response relationships between estrogen and bone turnover. In addition, 
studies in these unusual patients have stimulated research on defining the role 
of estrogen in regulating bone metabolism in normal adult and aging men, 
providing further insights into estrogen regulation of bone metabolism not only 
in men, but also in women.
