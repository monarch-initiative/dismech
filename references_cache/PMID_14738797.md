Intestinal infection with Vibrio cholerae results in the loss of large volumes 
of watery stool, leading to severe and rapidly progressing dehydration and 
shock. Without adequate and appropriate rehydration therapy, severe cholera 
kills about half of affected individuals. Cholera toxin, a potent stimulator of 
adenylate cyclase, causes the intestine to secrete watery fluid rich in sodium, 
bicarbonate, and potassium, in volumes far exceeding the intestinal absorptive 
capacity. Cholera has spread from the Indian subcontinent where it is endemic to 
involve nearly the whole world seven times during the past 185 years. V cholerae 
serogroup O1, biotype El Tor, has moved from Asia to cause pandemic disease in 
Africa and South America during the past 35 years. A new serogroup, O139, 
appeared in south Asia in 1992, has become endemic there, and threatens to start 
the next pandemic. Research on case management of cholera led to the development 
of rehydration therapy for dehydrating diarrhoea in general, including the 
proper use of intravenous and oral rehydration solutions. Appropriate case 
management has reduced deaths from diarrhoeal disease by an estimated 3 million 
per year compared with 20 years ago. Vaccination was thought to have no role for 
cholera, but new oral vaccines are showing great promise.
