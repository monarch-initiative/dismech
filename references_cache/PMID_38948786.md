Liprin-α1 is a widely expressed scaffolding protein responsible for regulating 
cellular processes such as focal adhesion, cell motility, and synaptic 
transmission. Liprin-α1 interacts with many proteins including ELKS, GIT1, 
liprin-β, and LAR-family receptor tyrosine protein phosphatase. Through these 
protein-protein interactions, liprin-α1 assembles large higher-order molecular 
complexes; however, the regulation of this complex assembly/disassembly is 
unknown. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a process that concentrates 
proteins within cellular nano-domains to facilitate efficient spatiotemporal 
signaling in response to signaling cascades. While there is no report that 
liprin-α1 spontaneously undergoes LLPS, we found that GFP-liprin-α1 expressed in 
HEK293 cells occasionally forms droplet-like condensates. MS-based interactomics 
identified Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/B56δ (PPP2R5D) trimers as specific 
interaction partners of liprin-α1 through a canonical Short Linear Interaction 
Motif (SLiM) in its N-terminal dimerization domain. Mutation of this SLiM nearly 
abolished PP2A interaction, and resulted in significantly increased LLPS. 
GFP-liprin-α1 showed significantly increased droplet formation in HEK293 cells 
devoid of B56δ (PPP2R5D knockout), suggesting that PPP2R5D/PP2A holoenzyme 
inhibits liprin-α1 LLPS. Guided by reported liprin-α1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation 
sites, we found liprin-α1 phospho-mimetic mutant at serine 763 (S763E) is 
sufficient to drive its LLPS. Domain mapping studies of liprin-α1 indicated that 
the intrinsically disordered region, the N-terminal dimerization domain, and the 
SAM domains are all necessary for liprin-α1 LLPS. Finally, expression of 
p.E420K, a human PPP2R5D variant causing Houge-Janssens Syndrome type 1 (also 
known as Jordan's Syndrome), significantly compromised suppression of liprin-α1 
LLPS. Our work identified B56δ-PP2A holoenzyme as an inhibitor of liprin-α1 LLPS 
via regulation at multiple phosphorylation sites.
