Free sialic acid storage disorder (FSASD) is a rare, autosomal recessive, 
neurodegenerative disorder caused by biallelic mutations in SLC17A5, encoding 
the lysosomal transmembrane sialic acid exporter, SLC17A5. Defects in SLC17A5 
lead to lysosomal accumulation of free sialic acid and other acid hexoses. The 
clinical spectrum of FSASD ranges from mild (Salla disease) to severe infantile 
forms. The pathobiology underlying FSASD remains elusive. In this study, two 
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines were generated from a mild and an 
intermediate FSASD patient and characterized to provide much-needed additional 
models for basic and translational studies.
