The term "trichrome vitiligo" has been used to describe lesions of vitiligo that 
have an intermediate level of color between the achromic center and the 
peripheral unaffected skin. We describe a 12-year-old black girl with a 
generalized pigmentary disorder that first appeared when she was 3 years of age. 
Five shades of colors--white, tan, medium brown (unaffected skin), dark brown, 
and black--were present. Biopsy specimens of the depigmented areas showed a 
complete absence of melanocytes, whereas the most hyperpigmented areas were 
characterized by an increase in epidermal pigment and number of melanocytes. The 
lack of any preceding inflammation in the affected areas and the subsequent 
widespread spontaneous depigmentation that occurred within 1 year pointed to a 
diagnosis of "pentachrome vitiligo."
