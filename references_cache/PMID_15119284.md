Opportunistic infection strategy.

[No authors listed]

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects immune cells, impairing their 
function and eventually destroying cells over time. This gradually weakens the 
immune system and the body loses the ability to fight disease. While HIV is the 
culprit, most people who die of AIDS do not die of HIV, per se, but from the 
numerous infections that the body can no longer control due to the collapse of 
the immune system. Relatively common infections, which may cause little or no 
harm in a healthy person, take the opportunity provided by weakened immune 
defenses to cause disease. This is why they are called opportunistic infections 
(OIs).
