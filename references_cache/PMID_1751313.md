All physicians should be alerted to the many drugs and other agents that are 
associated with drug-related lupus, as there is an increasing number of such 
drugs. A wide range of immune responses and antibodies are being reported with 
this syndrome. A new concern is the perceived ability of new biologic treatments 
to induce these autoimmune phenomena. More in-depth studies of various 
environmental factors are providing new insights into possible mechanisms. These 
include the immune responses to the drugs, their metabolites, and drug-altered 
conjugates; bioactivation mechanisms of drug protein conjugation; the role of 
macrophages in antigen recognition and processing; and lastly, the important 
role of the acetylation of various drugs and the relationship to immunogenetic 
factors. Continued study of this human experimental model of lupus will help to 
clarify the etiology and mechanisms of systemic lupus erythematosus itself.
