Examination of the CSF is the gold standard for the diagnosis of meningitis. 
There are a number of laboratory tests. in addition to CSF cell count, glucose 
concentration, Gram's stain, and bacterial culture, that are useful in 
identifying the organism and differentiating between bacterial and viral 
meningitis. These laboratory tests can be used in combination with the clinical 
presentation to determine which patient should be treated for bacterial 
meningitis while awaiting the result of CSF Gram's stain and bacterial culture.
