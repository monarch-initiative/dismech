A recent British-German study described ORMDL3 as a new asthma gene. Although 
the association with chromosome 17q12 marker is plausible from earlier linkage 
data, it is far from being clear which gene caused the association signal, as it 
is derived from a large linkage disequilibrium (LD) block. Not only Aiolos and 
GSDML but also distant genes that are regulated by this site may be relevant. 
There may be even unidentified RNA transcripts requiring a much more detailed 
genetic and functional analysis before finding ORMDL3 guilty by association.
