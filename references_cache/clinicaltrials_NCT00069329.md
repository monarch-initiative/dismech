# A Long-Term Outcome Study With the IL-1 Receptor Antagonist Anakinra/Kineret in Patients With Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID/CINCA Syndrome) A Therapeutic Approach to Study the Pathogenesis of This Disease

## Content

This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anakinra (Kineret) for treating patients with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), also known as chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous and arthropathy (CINCA) syndrome. This disease can cause rash, joint deformities, brain inflammation, eye problems, and learning difficulties. Immune suppressing medicines commonly used to treat other pediatric rheumatologic diseases do not suppress NOMID symptoms and, if used long-term and in high doses, can cause harmful side effects. Anakinra, approved by The Food and Drug Administration for treating rheumatoid arthritis in adults, blocks a substance called IL-1 that may be an important factor in causing the inflammation in NOMID.
