Haematological abnormalities are frequently encountered in patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Anaemia is the most common hematological 
abnormality in SLE, it is multifactorial. The most common form of anaemia is 
that of chronic disease, and it is relate with inflammatory cytokines. Other 
tips of anaemia are: iron deficiency anaemia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, 
pure red cell aplasia. Leucopenia is related to neutropenia and/or lymphopenia. 
Thrombocytopenia is common, autoimmune and associated with a decreased survival. 
The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies increase risk of thrombosis in 
patients with SLE.
