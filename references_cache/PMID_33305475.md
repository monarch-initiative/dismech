BACKGROUND: Multiple investigators have described an increased incidence of 
thromboembolic events in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Data concerning 
hemostatic complications in children hospitalized for COVID-19/multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are scant.
OBJECTIVES: To share our experience in managing SARS-CoV-2-associated 
pro-coagulant state in hospitalized children.
METHODS: D-dimer values were recorded at diagnosis in children hospitalized for 
SARS-CoV-2-related manifestations. In moderately to critically ill patients and 
MIS-C cases, coagulation and inflammatory markers were checked at multiple time 
points and median results were compared. Pro-thrombotic risk factors were 
appraised for each child and thromboprophylaxis was started in selected cases.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were prospectively enrolled. D-dimer values did 
not discriminate COVID-19 of differing severity, whereas were markedly different 
between the COVID-19 and the MIS-C cohorts. In both cohorts, D-dimer and 
C-reactive protein levels increased upon clinical worsening but were not 
accompanied by decreased fibrinogen or platelet values, with all parameters 
returning to normal upon disease resolution. Six patients had multiple 
thrombotic risk factors and were started on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. 
No deaths or thrombotic or bleeding complications occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pediatric patients show mildly altered coagulation and 
inflammatory parameters; on the other hand, MIS-C cases showed laboratory signs 
of an inflammatory driven pro-coagulant status. Universal anticoagulant 
prophylaxis in hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2-related manifestations is 
not warranted, but may be offered to patients with other pro-thrombotic risk 
factors in the context of a multi-modal therapeutic approach.
