Previously, management of hypertension has concentrated on lowering elevated 
blood pressure. However, the target has shifted to reducing absolute 
cardiovascular (CV) risk. It is estimated that two in three Australian adults 
have three or more CV risk factors at the same time. Moderate reductions in 
several risk factors can, therefore, be more effective than major reductions in 
one. When managing hypertension, therapy should be focused on medications with 
the strongest evidence for CV event reduction, substituting alternatives only 
when a primary choice is not appropriate. Hypertension management guidelines 
categorise angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin 
receptor blockers (ARB) interchangeably as first-line treatments in 
uncomplicated hypertension. These medications have different mechanisms of 
action and quite different evidence bases. They are not interchangeable and 
their prescription should be based on clinical evidence. Despite this, currently 
ARB prescriptions are increasing at a higher rate than those for ACEI and other 
antihypertensive classes. Evidence that ACEI therapy prevents CV events and 
death, in patients with coronary artery disease or multiple CV risk factors, 
emerged from the European trial on reduction of cardiac events with perindopril 
in stable coronary artery disease (EUROPA) and Heart Outcomes Prevention 
Evaluation (HOPE) trials respectively. The consistent benefit has been 
demonstrated in meta-analyses. The clinical trial data for ARB are less 
consistent, particularly regarding CV outcomes and mortality benefit. The 
evidence supports the use of ACEI (Class 1a) compared with ARB despite current 
prescribing trends.
