BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Kummell's disease (KD) is a long-term complication of 
vertebral compression fractures, resulting in vertebral collapse and kyphosis. 
Despite its clinical significance, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly 
understood.
PURPOSE: To identify the predictive factors for the onset of KD and provide 
clinical insights for early screening and intervention in KD patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
PATIENT SAMPLES: A total of 170 patients were included, comprising 66 with KD 
and 104 with old compression fractures.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Relevant clinical and imaging data were collected 
retrospectively. Spinal imaging indicators were also assessed.
METHODS: We analyzed clinical data from patients admitted from May 2021 to April 
2024 for vertebral compression fractures. Sixty-six diagnosed with KD based on 
clinical and imaging criteria were identified as the case group. The control 
group consisted of 104 patients with vertebral compression fractures who 
underwent conservative treatment and showed no signs of KD upon reexamination 
one year later. The clinical data included gender, age, bone mineral density 
(BMD), history of long-term smoking, alcohol abuse, hypertension, diabetes, 
coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, glucocorticoid use, previous vertebral 
compression fracture segment and vertebral compression ratio, Cobb angle, 
vertebral fracture morphology and disc degeneration grade. Independent 
predictive factors for KD were determined using multivariate binary logistic 
regression. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis and Kaplan-Meier 
plot were used to assess the diagnostic efficiency of parameters for predicting 
the occurrence of KD.
RESULTS: T-tests and Chi-square tests identified significant differences between 
groups in age, BMD, alcohol abuse, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, 
history of osteoporosis, history of glucocorticoid use, vertebral compression 
segment, Cobb angle, vertebral compression ratio, vertebral compression 
morphology, and disc degeneration grade between the two groups. Binary logistic 
regression revealed six independent predictors of KD: age, BMD, history of 
osteoporosis, vertebral compression rate, vertebral compression morphology, and 
disc degeneration grade. ROC demonstrated that age ≥ 70.5, BMD (T-score) ≤ - 
3.65 and a vertebral compression ratio ≥ 29.9% were strongly correlated with KD 
(P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier plot showed that most cases of KD occurred within one 
year after initial vertebral compression fractures, with significant differences 
in KD incidence observed across different disc degeneration grades (Log-rank 
test, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of developing KD is heightened in patients with the 
following predictive factors are present: (1) Age ≥ 70.5 years; (2) BMD 
(T-score) ≤ - 3.65; (3) History of osteoporosis; (4) Vertebral compression 
ratio ≥ 29.9%; (5) Wedge-shaped vertebral compression morphology; and (6) Grade 
III or higher disc degeneration. Early screening and regular follow-up of 
high-risk patients are recommended for timely preventive interventions.
