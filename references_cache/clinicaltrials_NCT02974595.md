# Studies of the Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Outcome of Autoinflammatory Diseases (NOMID/CAPS, DIRA, CANDLE, SAVI, NLRC4-MAS, Still'S-like Diseases, and Other Undifferentiated Autoinflammatory Diseases)

## Content

Background:

Some diseases cause chronic inflammation with intermittent flares in the body. These are called autoinflammatory diseases. They can cause fevers, rashes, ulcers, and other problems. Researchers want to learn more about the causes and effects of these diseases. They hope this will improve how the disease is managed in the future.

Objectives:

To understand the underlying immune dysregulation

To identify the genetic cause

To translate our findings into novel treatments that improve patients disease outcomes

Eligibility:

Patients with known NOMID/CAPS, DIRA, CANDLE, SAVI, NLRC4-MAS, Still's Disease, and with other yet undifferentiated autoinflammatory diseases.

Unaffected relatives of participants with a known or undifferentiated autoinflammatory disease

Healthy adult volunteers at least 18 years of age

Design:

Participants will be screened with blood sample and medical history. They may provide copies of their medical records.

Enrolled participants will be evaluated at the NIH for 2-5 days. All participants will have a detailed medical history, physical exam, blood tests, and other evaluations depending on the extent of their autoinflammatory disease.

Participants may also expect the following assessments:

1. Clinical tests that help assess organ damage and function such as hearing, vision, memory, and learning tests.
2. Imaging studies to characterize organ involvement of the inflammatory disease including: X-rays, CT scans, special MRIs, and bone scans.
3. Laboratory evaluations including clinical markers of disease activity, research samples for genetic studies, blood samples for cytokine/biomarker assessment, and gene expression profiling.
4. Questionnaires to assess disease activity and quality of life.
5. If indicated, other procedures may be administered that include: a lumbar puncture if CNS inflammation is suspected, a skin biopsy if skin inflammation is present, and/or gastrointestinal and pulmonary procedures if they are clinically indicated.

Participants may return for a single follow-up visit or for long-term follow-up visits depending on their disease and willingness to return. Long-term follow-up may occur for up to 15 years on this protocol.
