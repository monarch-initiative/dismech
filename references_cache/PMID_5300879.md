Electrocardiographic findings in cholera El Tor patients.

Kitamoto O, Hiraishi K, Takigami T, Saito M, Shimizu N.

One hundred and two electrocardiograms of 50 children and adults with El Tor 
cholera in the Philippines were analysed in relation to the course of the 
disease, plasma specific gravity and blood pressure. Pulmonary P waves, observed 
in 40% of the cases on admission, disappeared after rehydration. Hypokalaemic 
patterns were seen in 40% of the cases in the acute stage (during rehydration). 
This pattern became more marked after rehydration and disappeared gradually 
within 3-7 days.
