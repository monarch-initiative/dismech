PURPOSE: This study aims to present the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of 
Cogan's syndrome (CS) and the outcomes of hearing rehabilitation in long-term 
follow-up.
METHODS: Retrospective data analyses of patients with CS treated at Semmelweis 
University were performed. Comprehensive evaluations, including medical 
assessments, audiological measurements, otoneurological investigations, imaging, 
and ophthalmological examinations, were conducted on all patients.
RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2022, five patients with CS were followed. The 
severity and timing of ear and ocular symptoms varied. Bilateral, asymmetric 
hearing impairment manifested as sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and all 
patients experienced loss of bilateral vestibular function. Various 
ophthalmological manifestations showed instability over time. Systemic 
corticosteroids were the first-line treatment, immunosuppressive therapy 
(methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A), and biological treatment 
(infliximab, adalimumab) used as second- and third-line therapies. Eye symptoms 
of all five patients were controlled by medications. For hearing impairment, 
four patients were treated with cochlear implantation and achieved long-term 
stable speech perception. Hearing improvement was found in one patient by 
conservative therapy. One patient required reimplantation due to device failure, 
which was performed without complications.
CONCLUSION: Sudden hearing loss and vestibular attacks in young patients require 
thorough investigation and close follow-up. Early corticosteroid therapy or 
immunosuppressive and biological treatment can stabilize symptoms, including 
hearing levels. Early hearing rehabilitation with cochlear implants is crucial. 
Long-term follow-up indicates stable hearing levels and speech perception.
