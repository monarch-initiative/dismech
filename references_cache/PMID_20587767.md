BACKGROUND: Case reports in which abrupt clozapine discontinuation led to a 
return of psychosis, autonomic instability, or catatonia have been previously 
presented in the literature.
OBJECTIVE: The authors report on symptom presentation and resolution in a case 
of abrupt withdrawal of clozapine medication.
METHOD: The authors describe the condition and history of the patient, a 
49-year-old woman with schizophrenia, the medical support she received, and the 
re-initiation of her clozapine medication.
RESULTS: Symptoms of catatonia and autonomic instability resolved by Day 4 of 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Patients and their caregivers need to be educated about the effects 
of abrupt cessation of clozapine administration.
