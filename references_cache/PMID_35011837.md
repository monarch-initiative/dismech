Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic dermatosis typified by extraordinarily itchy 
nodules. However, little is known of the nature and extent of PN in Asian 
people. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology, comorbidities, and 
prescription pattern of PN in Koreans based on a large dermatology outpatient 
cohort. Patients with PN were identified from the Catholic Medical Center (CMC) 
clinical data warehouse. Anonymized data on age, sex, diagnostic codes, 
prescriptions, visitation dates, and other relevant parameters were collected. 
Pearson correlation analysis was used to calculate the correlation between PN 
prevalence and patient age. Conditional logistic regression modeling was adopted 
to measure the comorbidity risk of PN. A total of 3591 patients with PN were 
identified at the Catholic Medical Center Health System dermatology outpatient 
clinic in the period 2007-2020. A comparison of the study patients with age- and 
sex-matched controls (dermatology outpatients without PN) indicated that PN was 
associated with various comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (adjusted 
odds ratio (aOR), 1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29-1.70), dyslipidemia 
(aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.56-2.27), type 2 diabetes mellitus (aOR, 1.37; 95% CI, 
1.22-1.54), arterial hypertension (aOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.30-1.73), autoimmune 
thyroiditis (aOR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.42-4.16), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (aOR, 1.95; 
95% CI, 1.23-3.07), and atopic dermatitis (aOR, 2.16, 95% CI, 1.91-2.45). 
Regarding prescription patterns, topical steroids were most favored, followed by 
topical calcineurin inhibitors; oral antihistamines were the most preferred 
systemic agent for PN. PN is a relatively rare but significant disease among 
Korean dermatology outpatients with a high comorbidity burden compared to 
dermatology outpatients without PN. There is great need for breakthroughs in PN 
treatment.
