Variant of keratoderma hereditaria mutilans (Vohwinkel's syndrome). Treatment 
with orally administered isotretinoin.

Camisa C, Rossana C.

Keratoderma hereditaria mutilans (KHM), or Vohwinkel's syndrome, is a rare 
genodermatosis consisting of hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles with a 
characteristic "honeycomb" appearance, keratotic structures taking the shape of 
a starfish and/or knuckle pads on the dorsal surfaces of the hands, and 
constricting bands (pseudoainhum) encircling digits of the hands and feet. We 
describe three cases of a variant of KHM with an associated ichthyosiform 
dermatosis in a pedigree consisting of 19 affected individuals through six 
generations. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern for KHM was confirmed. 
One of the patients was successfully treated with isotretinoin, 0.6 mg/kg/day 
orally. We offer five hypothetical genetic models to account for the 
simultaneous expression of palmar-plantar keratoderma and ichthyosiform 
dermatosis.
