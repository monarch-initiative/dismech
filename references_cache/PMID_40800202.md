BACKGROUND: The clinical features and diagnostic procedures of fungal otitis 
externa in children have been changed in recent years. This study aimed to 
summarize and analyze the epidemiological characteristics and evolving trends in 
the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric fungal otitis externa over a period of 
8 years.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on children diagnosed with fungal 
otitis externa between January 2016 and December 2023. The cohort was assigned 
into two groups based on visit time: early-visit [2016-2019] and late-visit 
[2020-2023]. Comparisons were made regarding visit patterns, diagnostic 
approaches, treatment strategies, and etiological characteristics.
RESULTS: A higher prevalence was noted in male patients (P<0.001). The incidence 
peaked between July and October, with a significant increase in the third 
quarter (July-September) compared to other periods (P<0.001). The early-visit 
group (849 cases) had a significantly greater number of patients than the 
late-visit group (528 cases, P=0.001), and children in the early-visit group 
were younger (P<0.001). In the late-visit group, the diagnostic approach shifted 
from fungal smears to a combination of otoscopy and microbial culture, along 
with increased use of triamcinolone acetonide and econazole nitrate cream due to 
their broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory properties.
CONCLUSIONS: Fungal otitis externa occurs more frequently in male children, with 
a seasonal peak during summer. A decline in patient numbers was observed in the 
late-visit group, and the average age of the affected children was higher. 
Changes in diagnostic methods have influenced treatment strategies, leading to 
the increased use of triamcinolone acetonide and econazole nitrate cream.
