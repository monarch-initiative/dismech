Targeted therapy of non-small cell lung cancer.

[Article in English]

Svaton M.

The review article presents the current state and development of the treatment 
with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. It 
focuses on the therapeutic progress of traditionally targeted gene mutations 
EGFR, ALK and ROS1, as well as new established or promising targets. Mutations 
in the BRAF, NTRK, RET, cMET, HER2 and KRAS genes are discussed in this regard. 
In EGFR mutations, it focuses mainly on possible combination therapy and 
treatment for mutations in exon 20. In ALK translocation, it points to a new 
generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In ROS1, the article mentions possible 
treatment in addition to the usual krizotinib, including the treatment after 
disease progression. For other genes, the author lists newly approved molecules, 
or molecules in the promising phase of their development.
