Severely dehydrated calves that are unable to suckle need intravenous fluids for 
effective resuscitation. Intravenous fluid therapy is also indicated for sick 
calves without obvious dehydration, such as calves with strong ion acidosis, 
ruminal acidosis (rumen drinkers), severe pneumonia, septicemia, or hypothermia. 
This article presents an updated overview of intravenous fluid therapy for 
calves, recent insights into the development of metabolic acidosis in young 
calves resulting from accumulation of D-lactate, a simplified algorithm for 
intravenous fluid therapy, and a procedure for ear vein catheterization under 
field conditions.
