Puberty is a dynamic period of physical growth, sexual maturation, and 
psychosocial achievement that generally begins between age 8 and 14 years. The 
age of onset varies as a function of sex, ethnicity, health status, genetics, 
nutrition, and activity level. Puberty is initiated by hormonal changes 
triggered by the hypothalamus. Children with variants of normal pubertal 
development--both early and late puberty--are common in pediatric practice. 
Recognizing when variations are normal and when referral for further evaluation 
is indicated is an important skill.
