The collapse of geographical space over the last 200 years has had profound 
effects on the circulation of human populations and on the transfer of 
infectious diseases. Three examples are used to illustrate the process: (a) the 
impact of the switch from sail to steamships in importing measles into Fiji over 
a 40-year period; (b) changes in measles epidemic behaviour in Iceland over a 
150-year period; and (c) changes in the spread of cholera within the United 
States over a 35-year period. In each case, the link between time, travel and 
disease has been an intimate one.
