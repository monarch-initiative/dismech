OBJECTIVE: Restenosis after transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is a 
known complication. When identified in the early postoperative period, it may be 
related to technique. We evaluated our TCAR experience to identify potentially 
modifiable factors impacting restenosis.
METHODS: This is a single-institution, retrospective review of patients 
undergoing TCAR from November 2017 to July 2022. Restenosis was defined as >50% 
stenosis on duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination or computed tomographic 
angiography (CTA). Continuous variables were compared using Kruskal-Wallis's 
test. Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Of 61 interventions, 11 (18%) developed restenosis within the median 
follow-up of 345 days (interquartile range, 103-623 days). Among these patients, 
82% (9/11) had >50% stenosis, and 18% (2/11) had >80% stenosis. Both patients 
with high-grade restenosis were symptomatic and underwent revascularization. 
Diagnosis of post-TCAR restenosis was via DUS examination in 45% (5/11), CTA in 
18% (2/11), or both CTA/DUS examination in 36% (4/11). Restenosis occurred 
within 1 month in 54% (6/11) and 6 months in 72% (8/11) of patients. However, 
three of the six patients with restenosis within 1 month had discordant findings 
on CTA vs DUS imaging. Patient comorbidities, degree of preoperative stenosis, 
medical management, balloon size, stent size, lesion characteristics, and 
predilatation angioplasty did not differ. Patients with restenosis were younger 
(P = .02), had prior ipsilateral endarterectomy (odds ratio [OR], 6.5; P = .02), 
had history of neck radiation (OR, 18.3; P = .01), and lower rate of 
postdilatation angioplasty (OR, 0.11; P = .04), without an increased risk of 
neurological events.
CONCLUSIONS: Although post-TCAR restenosis occurred in 18% of patients, only 3% 
of patients had critical restenosis and required reintervention. Patient factors 
associated with restenosis were younger age, prior endarterectomy, and history 
of neck radiation. Although early restenosis may be mitigated by improved 
technique, the only technical factor associated with restenosis was less use of 
postdilatation angioplasty. Balancing neurological risk, this factor may have 
increased application in appropriate patients. Diagnosis of restenosis was 
inconsistent between imaging modalities; current surveillance paradigms and 
diagnostic thresholds may warrant reconsideration.
