Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a cutaneous, locally aggressive 
spindle cell tumor of intermediate malignancy. Tumor cells are reactive for CD34 
and characterized by a t(17;22) translocation or a supernumerary ring chromosome 
that results in the fusion of exon 2 of PDGFB to various exons of the COL1A1 
gene. We developed a multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) assay to detect fusion transcripts for all possible COL1A1 breakpoints. 
Twenty-seven formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded DFSP cases were analyzed using 18 
COL1A1 forward primers and 1 exon 2 PDGFB reverse primer. Sequence analysis was 
performed to definitively characterize breakpoints. Results were correlated with 
histology, immunohistochemistry, PDGFB break-apart fluorescence in situ 
hybridization analysis, and cytogenetics when available. Fusion transcripts were 
detected by RT-PCR in all but one DFSP case. Sequencing revealed a PDGFB exon 2 
breakpoint in all cases. COL1A1 breakpoints were in exons 7 (1 patient), 10 (1), 
29 (2), 40 (1), 46 (3), and 49 (2), and intronic between exons 13:14 (1), 26:27 
(2), 30:31 (1) 33:34 (1), 43:44 (7), 45:46 (1), and 46:47 (1). Three novel 
COL1A1 breakpoints were identified, intronic between exons 13:14 (1), 30:31 (1) 
and in exon 49 (2). There was no correlation found between breakpoints and age, 
sex, or histologic variants. Using this sensitive multiplex RT-PCR assay in 
combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found COL1A1-PDGFB 
rearrangements appear more prevalent in DFSP than previously reported. Its 
detection may be particularly helpful in the differential diagnosis of atypical, 
fibrosarcomatous, and metastatic DFSP.
