# A Phase 3 Prospective, Randomized, Double-blinded, Placebo-controlled Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of RBX2660 (Microbiota Suspension) for the Prevention of Clostridium Difficile Infection

## Content

This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of a microbiota suspension of intestinal microbes. Patients who have had at least one recurrence after a primary episode and have completed at least one round of standard-of-care oral antibiotic therapy or have had at least two episodes of severe Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) resulting in hospitalization within the last year may be eligible for the study. Subjects who are deemed failures following the blinded treatment per the pre-specified treatment failure definition may elect to receive an unblinded dose of RBX2660.
