Objectives: Campylobacter spp. remain a leading cause of bacterial 
gastroenteritis worldwide, with resistance to antibiotics posing significant 
challenges to treatment and public health. This study examines profiles in 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) for Campylobacter isolates from human and animal 
sources over the past decade. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review of 
resistance data from studies spanning ten years, analyzing profiles in 
resistance to key antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (CIP), tetracycline (TET), 
erythromycin (ERY), chloramphenicol (CHL), and gentamicin (GEN). Data were 
collated from various regions to assess global and regional patterns of 
resistance. Results: The analysis reveals a concerning trend of increasing 
resistance patterns, particularly to CIP and TET, across multiple regions. While 
resistance to CHL and GEN remains relatively low, the high prevalence of CIP 
resistance has significantly compromised treatment options for 
campylobacteriosis. Discrepancies in resistance patterns were observed between 
human and animal isolates, with variations across different continents and 
countries. Notably, resistance to ERY and CHL showed regional variability, 
reflecting potential differences in antimicrobial usage and management 
practices. Conclusions: The findings underscore the ongoing challenge of AMR in 
Campylobacter, highlighting the need for continued surveillance and research. 
The rising resistance prevalence, coupled with discrepancies in resistance 
patterns between human and animal isolates, emphasize the importance of a One 
Health approach to address AMR. Enhanced monitoring, novel treatment strategies, 
and global cooperation are crucial for mitigating the impact of resistance and 
ensuring the effective management of Campylobacter-related infections.
