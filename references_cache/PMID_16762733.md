Melanoma has been widely studied as a target for immunotherapy because it has 
been considered more susceptible to immune attack than other tumors and because 
of the relative ease with which melanoma cells can be adapted to in vitro 
culture. The availability of hundreds of melanoma cell lines for study has led 
to the identification of tumor antigens and the development of monoclonal 
antibodies and T cells against these antigens, revolutionizing the understanding 
of how the immune system sees and reacts to cancer. This article reviews the 
recent clinical results of trials exploring different immunotherapy strategies 
against melanoma.
