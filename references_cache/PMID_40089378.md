Human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness is caused by infection with 
Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense parasites, which 
are transmitted by tsetse flies in sub-Saharan Africa. Control of human African 
trypanosomiasis is based on case detection, treatment, and vector control. In 
the past decade, simple rapid diagnostic tests were introduced for gambiense 
human African trypanosomiasis, facilitating screening in primary health-care 
facilities. A new oral drug, fexinidazole, became the first-line treatment for 
gambiense human African trypanosomiasis without severe meningo-encephalitic 
disease, as well as for rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis. Medical 
interventions, in some areas combined with tiny target-based vector control, 
have substantially reduced human African trypanosomiasis incidence, despite 
temporary disruptions to health-care systems. The elimination of human African 
trypanosomiasis as a public health problem has been achieved, and elimination of 
gambiense human African trypanosomiasis transmission is now targeted for 2030. 
Improved diagnostics and drugs, continued involvement of populations at risk of 
disease, health staff, national authorities, and partners and donors all 
contribute to achieve this goal.
