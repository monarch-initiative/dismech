Prosper Meniere made his immortal contribution to the field of otology in 1861. 
At that time, all manner of "fits" were lumped together under the diagnosis of 
"apoplectiform cerebral congestion"-too much blood in the brain. His genius was 
to identify a specific subset of this heterogeneous pool whose cardinal 
symptoms, tinnitus, fluctuating progressive deafness, and episodic vertigo, were 
due to dysfunction of the inner ear. Seventy-seven years later, in 1938, 
Hallpike and Cairns in England and Yamakawa in Japan identified cochleosaccular 
endolymphatic hydrops (EH) as the histopathologic correlate of Meniere's disease 
(MD). Over the 85 years since then, many theories to explain the symptoms of MD 
have come and gone. A consensus has slowly emerged that patients with this 
condition have a failure of inner ear homeostasis. The cause(s) of this 
homeostatic failure and the mechanism(s) by which this failure leads to 
fluctuating progressive sensorineural hearing loss and episodic vertigo has 
remained elusive. In the last few years, new techniques and findings in temporal 
bone histopathology and in vivo temporal bone imaging have yielded breakthroughs 
in this field. We are now recapitulating Meniere's approach by taking the 
heterogeneous population of patients with MD and segregating them into specific 
subtypes based upon clinical phenotype. Salient clinical features include 
vestibular aqueduct and endolymphatic sac morphology, age at symptom onset, sex, 
and incidence of bilateral involvement. Furthermore, new imaging modalities 
enable unequivocal diagnosis of EH, transitioning MD from a "clinical" diagnosis 
to one based upon specific objective criteria. These breakthroughs have opened 
the door to genetic analyses, consideration of comorbid clinical disorders, 
especially migraine, and potential new treatments, and demand that we revisit 
all the various treatments that have been considered previously. They also 
demand new and more stringent criteria for any publication about this condition. 
In this paper we will review these new findings, discuss their immediate 
implications for clinical practice, and consider some of the most pressing 
research questions for near- and long-term address.
