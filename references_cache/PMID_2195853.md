Meckel's diverticulum, a relatively common congenital anomaly of the 
gastrointestinal tract, is present in approximately 2 percent of the population. 
When symptoms develop, they are usually the result of inflammation, hemorrhage 
or obstruction. Diagnosis is made by maintaining a high index of suspicion, 
carefully reviewing data from the history and physical examination, and 
performing a radionuclide scan. Surgical removal is usually indicated when 
symptoms occur. An asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum that is discovered 
incidentally at surgery should usually be removed unless contraindications 
exist.
