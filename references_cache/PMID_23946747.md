The silent sinus syndrome (SSS) involves painless facial asymmetry and 
enophthalmos, which is the result of chronic maxillary sinus atelectasis. In 
most cases, it is diagnosed clinically, however, using the characteristic 
imaging features including maxillary sinus outlet obstruction, sinus 
opacification, and sinus volume loss caused by inward retraction of the sinus 
walls. Obstruction of the maxillary ostium appears to play a critical role in 
the development of SSS. Treatment involves functional endoscopic surgery.
