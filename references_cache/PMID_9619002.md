Although peripheral neuropathy is a fairly common finding in chronic arsenic 
poisoning, little is known about the acute effects of this metal on peripheral 
nerves. This report shows clinical and electrophysiological findings in a 
patient who developed peripheral neuropathy only three days after a high-dose 
ingestion of this metal due to a failed suicide attempt. We speculate that 
peripheral nerves and some cranial nerves can show not only clinical but also 
subclinical involvement that can only be detected by neurophysiological studies.
