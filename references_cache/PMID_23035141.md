Although sickle cell trait protects against severe disease due to Plasmodium 
falciparum, it has not been clear whether sickle trait also protects against 
asymptomatic infection (parasitemia). To address this question, the authors 
identified 171 persistently smear-negative children and 450 asymptomatic 
persistently smear-positive children in Bancoumana, Mali (June 1996 to June 
1998). They then followed both groups for 2 years using a cohort-based strategy. 
Among the 171 children with persistently negative smears, the median time for 
conversion to smear-positive was longer for children with sickle trait than for 
children without (274 vs. 108 days, P < 0.001; Cox hazard ratio = 0.56, 95% 
confidence interval: 0.33, 0.96; P = 0.036). Similar differences were found in 
the median times to reinfection after spontaneous clearance without treatment 
(365 days vs. 184 days; P = 0.01). Alternatively, among the 450 asymptomatic 
children with persistently positive smears, the median time for conversion to 
smear-negative (spontaneous clearance) was shorter for children with sickle 
trait than for children without (190 vs. 365 days; P = 0.02). These protective 
effects of sickle trait against asymptomatic P. falciparum infection under 
conditions of natural transmission were demonstrable using a cohort-based 
approach but not when the same data were examined using a cross-sectional 
approach.
