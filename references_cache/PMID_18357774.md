The origins of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are largely unknown. Fewer than 50% of the 
cases of the disease are attributable to host genetics, indicating that 
environmental factors are involved in disease development. The most often cited 
environmental agents implicated as initiators of T1D are the human 
enteroviruses, in particular the group B coxsackieviruses (CVB). Although the 
connection between the CVB and T1D has not been firmly established, significant' 
evidence supports the role of these pathogens in T1D development.
