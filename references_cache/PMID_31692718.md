INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B is a major health concern in Ghana, where prevalence 
of the virus remains high and most chronic patients are infected during 
childhood or at birth. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and main 
factors associated with mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B in the 
context of Ghana.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional pilot study, we tested infants born to 
hepatitis B positive mothers at a hospital in the Eastern Region of Ghana to 
determine the prevalence of mother-to-child transmission. A questionnaire was 
completed by hepatitis B positive mothers to investigate the association between 
factors surrounding the birth of the child and whether transmission had 
occurred. These factors were analyzed independently using Fisher's exact test. 
To investigate the relationship between mother's age at the time of delivery and 
viral transmission, a univariate logistic regression analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The prevalence of mother-to-child transmission was 5.9%, with 51 
hepatitis B positive mothers included in the study and three infants testing 
positive. A majority of infants received the standard hepatitis B vaccination 
schedule (96.1%) while two-thirds received the birth dose. There was no 
significant association observed between the clinical interventions reported in 
the study and mother-to-child transmission. No significant association was 
observed between the age of the mother at the time of delivery and viral 
transmission (OR: 1.077, 95% CI: 0.828 - 1.403, p = 0.58). Viral marker testing 
during pregnancy was absent in the population and could not be reliably 
assessed.
CONCLUSION: There was a low prevalence of HBV mother-to-child transmission 
observed despite a clear absence of viral marker and viral load testing. It is 
recommended that viral profile analysis is performed for hepatitis B positive 
pregnancies to identify high risk cases.
