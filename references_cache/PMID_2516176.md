A 28-year-old man with classical phenylketonuria had increased seizure frequency 
and rapidly progressive spasticity. There was a marked reduction of biogenic 
amine neurotransmitter metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid. Dietary therapy 
reduced serum phenylalanine levels, improved symptoms of hypertonicity, and 
cerebrospinal fluid neurotransmitter metabolites became normal. An adolescent 
male with classical phenylketonuria, treated by dietary restriction until age 6 
years, was assessed for decreasing school performance at 18 years. Cerebrospinal 
fluid biogenic amine neurotransmitter metabolites were significantly reduced. 
Magnetic resonance imaging in both subjects showed multiple areas of increased 
signal intensity in cerebral white matter. Neuropathological changes in 
classical phenylketonuria have been characterized as a dysmyelinating or 
demyelinating process. Neurochemical studies show a defect in brain lipids and 
biogenic amine metabolism. In the past, dietary therapy was directed at reducing 
hyperphenylalaninaemia only during the first decade of life. This report, as 
well as other studies, indicates that dietary therapy should be lifelong in 
patients with classical phenylketonuria, in order to prevent progressive and 
insidious neurological deterioration in later life.
