This study aimed to identify seasonal variations in the presentation of primary 
varicella infection in susceptible patients in Victoria (a temperate region in 
south-east Australia) by analysing Victorian hospital admissions data and 
medical locum service data from the years preceding the introduction of a 
universally offered vaccination, complemented by available surveillance data 
from the neighbouring state, of South Australia. Contrary to the conventional 
assumption, which is based on observations in temperate regions elsewhere in the 
world, we found no consistent evidence of seasonal peaks during late winter and 
early spring for varicella infection in Victoria. This finding may have 
implications for prevention in temperate regions elsewhere in the world wherever 
estimations of local seasonal trends have been based on international 
experiences.
