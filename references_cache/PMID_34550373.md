Mathematical modeling can be used to project the impact of mass vaccination on 
cholera transmission. Here, we discuss 2 examples for which indirect protection 
from mass vaccination needs to be considered. In the first, we show that 
nonvaccinees can be protected by mass vaccination campaigns. This additional 
benefit of indirect protection improves the cost-effectiveness of mass 
vaccination. In the second, we model the use of mass vaccination to eliminate 
cholera. In this case, a high population level of immunity, including 
contributions from infection and vaccination, is required to reach the "herd 
immunity" threshold needed to stop transmission and achieve elimination.
