Pregnancy is accompanied by several physiological changes such as altered 
salivary flow rate, mucosal immunity and altered microbial flora. This may 
predispose pregnant women to oral health problems. This could be accentuated by 
oral health neglect, polypharmacy and a host of other factors, including dietary 
modification. However, a very significant percentage of women are not counselled 
on oral health during pregnancy. Lack of proper oral healthcare and awareness 
predispose pregnant women to oral and odontogenic infections, which can lead to 
severe complications. The manuscript aims to present a rare case of Ludwig's 
angina (LA) in a full-term pregnant woman requiring immediate attention.
