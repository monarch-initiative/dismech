Lymphoma is the second most common neoplasm of the head and neck region and 
should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any lesion in this region, 
especially if the typical factors for squamous cell carcinoma are not present. 
The head and neck is the second most common site for extranodal lymphoma. It can 
involve virtually any region, including the orbit, paranasal sinuses, Waldeyer's 
ring, salivary glands, or thyroid. Communication with the surgeon and 
pathologist is essential to prevent an incorrect or delayed diagnosis. One 
should consider the diagnosis of lymphoma especially when multiple, large, 
nonnecrotic lymph nodes are present or multiple sites of disease are identified 
in extranodal tissue.
