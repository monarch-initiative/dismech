Arsenic exposure causes immense health distress by increasing risk of 
cardiovascular abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, neurotoxicity, and 
nephrotoxicity. The present study explored the role of inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS) inhibitors against sodium arsenite-induced renal and hepatic 
dysfunction in rats. Female Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to arsenic 
toxicity by administering sodium arsenite (5 mg/kg/day, oral) for 4 weeks. The 
iNOS inhibitors, S-methylisothiourea (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and aminoguanidine 
(100 mg/kg, i.p.) were given one hour before sodium arsenite administration in 
rats for 4 weeks. Sodium arsenite led rise in serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, 
electrolytes (potassium, fractional excretion of sodium), microproteinuria, and 
decreased creatinine clearance (p < 0.001) indicated renal dysfunction in rats. 
Arsenic-intoxication resulted in significant oxidative stress in rat kidneys, 
which was measured in terms of increase in lipid peroxides, superoxide anion 
generation and decrease in reduced glutathione (p < 0.001) levels. A threefold 
increase in renal hydroxyproline level in arsenic intoxicated rats indicated 
fibrosis. Hematoxylin-eosin staining indicated tubular damage, whereas 
picrosirius red staining highlighted collagen deposition in rat kidneys. 
S-methylisothiourea and aminoguanidine improved renal function and attenuated 
arsenic led renal oxidative stress, fibrosis, and decreased the kidney injury 
score. Additionally, arsenite-intoxication resulted in significant rise in 
hepatic parameters (serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transferase, 
alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin (p < 0.001) along with multi-fold increase 
in oxidative stress, fibrosis and liver injury score in rats, which was 
significantly (p < 0.001) attenuated by concurrent administration of iNOS 
inhibitors). Hence, it is concluded that iNOS inhibitors attenuate sodium 
arsenite-induced renal and hepatic dysfunction in rats.
