BACKGROUND: The understanding of chronic spontaneous urticaria pathogenesis has 
been increasing recently. The central role of mast cells is being reinforced, 
but multiple cells, pathways, and mediators are involved in a complex 
interrelationship. Modern therapies for its management reflect the need to 
encompass different mechanisms and promise to alter the course of urticaria and 
the long journey of those with refractory disease. Continuous updating of these 
aspects is necessary to optimize patient care.
OBJECTIVES: To review concepts and advances in the pathogenesis of chronic 
spontaneous urticaria, in addition to contextualizing promising drug options for 
its management.
METHOD: A narrative review was conducted between 1977 and 2024, including 
relevant articles published in the scientific literature, indexed in the PubMed 
system.
RESULTS: A total of 25,732 articles were found. Inclusion criteria were 
determined by the authors' decision regarding their level of importance for 
furthering knowledge in the areas of pathogenesis and treatment of chronic 
spontaneous urticaria, with preference given to meta-analyses, systematic 
reviews, and randomized trials. Regarding therapeutics, 138 articles from the 
last 15 years were prioritized, in addition to records on ClinicalTrials.gov, 
and the drugs could be in the clinical trial phase. Immunobiologicals and small 
molecules hold promise for future treatment regimens for chronic spontaneous 
urticaria.
STUDY LIMITATIONS: Narrative reviews do not provide statistical value to the 
results and outcomes studied.
CONCLUSION: A review of the pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria was 
conducted, contextualizing these aspects with promising drug options for its 
treatment, particularly immunobiologicals and small molecules.
