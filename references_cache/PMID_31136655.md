BACKGROUND: Dementia and late-life cognitive decline are leading causes of death 
and disability in the United States. Prevention of these diseases, by 
maintaining brain health throughout the life course, is essential. Diet and 
lifestyle changes are the chief strategies aimed at primary prevention for many 
of the risk factors of cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the potential impact of dietary 
factors on cognitive function.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study followed 516 young adults through 
midlife. The Youth/Adolescent Questionnaire was used to collect habitual 
nutrition data (mean age: 32.03 ± 5.96 y) at baseline. Scores from a 
neurocognitive battery were used to assess cognitive function (mean age: 
49.03 ± 4.86 y) at follow-up and were transformed to z scores. Separate 
multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were fitted. The trend across 
quintiles for each dietary variable was assessed.
RESULTS: Vitamin B-6, whole grains, processed meats, and foods fried at home all 
displayed significant linear trends in their relation with cognitive function. 
Dietary intake of vitamin B-6 and whole grains was directly associated with 
better cognitive function after adjustment for age, race, sex, and total calorie 
intake (β coefficient from linear regression and SE: 1.755 ± 0.621, P = 0.005, 
and 0.001 ± 0.000, P = 0.018, respectively). Processed meat and foods fried at 
home consistently displayed inverse associations with cognitive function across 
crude and adjusted models (linear trend P values were 0.05 and <0.0001, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that dietary consumption in young adulthood 
may affect cognitive function in midlife. Strong associations between dietary 
intake and cognition were observed in our analysis, but as with all 
observational studies, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be 
excluded.
