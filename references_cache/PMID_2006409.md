Diabetic hyperglycemia: link to impaired glucose transport in pancreatic beta

Glucose uptake into pancreatic beta cells by means of the glucose transporter 
GLUT-2, which has a high Michaelis constant, is essential for the normal insulin 
secretory response to hyperglycemia. In both autoimmune and nonautoimmune 
diabetes, this glucose transport is reduced as a consequence of down-regulation 
of the normal beta-cell transporter. In autoimmune diabetes, circulating 
immunoglobulins can further impair this glucose transport by inhibiting 
functionally intact transporters. Insights into mechanisms of the 
unresponsiveness of beta cells to hyperglycemia may improve the management and 
prevention of diabetes.
