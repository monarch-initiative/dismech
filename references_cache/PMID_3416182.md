Electron microscopic examination of sections immunocytochemically processed with 
an anti-glutamate serum reveals that many asymmetric synapses in the cat 
neocortex contain elevated levels of immunodetectable glutamate. These labelled 
axon terminals are likely to use glutamate as neurotransmitter. Axon terminals 
forming symmetric contacts were never labelled. Since glutamate is known to 
exert potent excitatory effects on neocortical neurons, the present finding 
gives immunocytochemical evidence that asymmetric synapses are excitatory.
