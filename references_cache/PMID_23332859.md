Mal del pinto is a dermatological disease characterized by discoloured patches 
of skin on the face and body. It has been present in what is now the territory 
of Mexico from before the Spanish conquest up to recent times. Though early 
concerns for mal del pinto as a public health problem can be traced back to the 
late 19th century, no campaign to combat the disease was undertaken until the 
second half of the 20th. Thanks to the effectiveness of treatment with 
penicillin, the fight against this illness--which was once assumed as a symbol 
of pride--enjoyed a broader acceptance among the population that other health 
campaigns.
