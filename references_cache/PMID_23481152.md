This is a report of a 4-year-old Hispanic boy who presented with skin changes to 
the lips and oral cavity, a generalized rash, edema of hands and feet, and 
peeling of the periungual areas of the fingers as well as to the groin and 
perianal areas. Fourteen days earlier, his 19-month-old brother was diagnosed 
and treated for Kawasaki disease. Upon laboratory investigation, our patient was 
found to have an elevated sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and serum 
γ-glutamyl transferase. Infectious disease and cardiology consultations 
subsequently diagnosed and treated our patient for incomplete Kawasaki disease.
