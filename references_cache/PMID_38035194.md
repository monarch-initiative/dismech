Understanding human mobility patterns is vital for the coordinated development 
of cities in urban agglomerations. Existing mobility models can capture 
single-scale travel behavior within or between cities, but the unified modeling 
of multi-scale human mobility in urban agglomerations is still analytically and 
computationally intractable. In this study, by simulating people's mental 
representations of physical space, we decompose and model the human travel 
choice process as a cascaded multi-class classification problem. Our multi-scale 
unified model, built upon cascaded deep neural networks, can predict human 
mobility in world-class urban agglomerations with thousands of regions. By 
incorporating individual memory features and population attractiveness features 
extracted by a graph generative adversarial network, our model can 
simultaneously predict multi-scale individual and population mobility patterns 
within urban agglomerations. Our model serves as an exemplar framework for 
reproducing universal-scale laws of human mobility across various spatial 
scales, providing vital decision support for urban settings of urban 
agglomerations.
