A mathematical model is formulated for the transmission and spread of cholera in 
a heterogeneous host population that consists of several patches of homogeneous 
host populations sharing a common water source. The basic reproduction number ℛ0 
is derived and shown to determine whether or not cholera dies out. Explicit 
formulas are derived for target/type reproduction numbers that measure the 
control strategies required to eradicate cholera from all patches.
