INTRODUCTION: Studies that generate information that may reduce the dengue death 
risk are essential. This study analyzed time trends and risk factors for dengue 
mortality and fatality in Brazil from 2001 to 2011.
METHODS: Time trends for dengue mortality and fatality rates were analyzed using 
simple linear regression. Associations between the dengue mortality and the case 
fatality rates and socioeconomic, demographic, and health care indicators at the 
municipality level were analyzed using negative binomial regression.
RESULTS: The dengue hemorrhagic fever case fatality rate increased in Brazil 
from 2001 to 2011 (β=0.67; p=0.036), in patients aged 0-14 years (β=0.48; 
p=0.030) and in those aged ≥15 years (β=1.1; p<0.01). Factors associated with 
the dengue case fatality rate were the average income per capita (MRR=0.99; 
p=0.038) and the number of basic health units per population (MRR=0.89; 
p<0.001). Mortality rates increased from 2001 to 2011 (β=0.350; p=0.002).Factors 
associated with mortality were inequality (RR=1.02; p=0.001) high income per 
capita (MRR=0.99; p=0.005), and higher proportions of populations living in 
urban areas (MRR=1.01; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The increases in the dengue mortality and case fatality rates and 
the associated socioeconomic and health care factors, suggest the need for 
structural and intersectoral investments to improve living conditions and to 
sustainably reduce these outcomes.
