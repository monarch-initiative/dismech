Crohn's disease is a chronic and progressive immune-mediated disease with 
increasing incidence worldwide. There are no curative therapies. The primary 
agents used in the treatment of Crohn's disease are aminosalicylates, 
corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics. Each agent has different roles 
in the induction and maintenance of remission of disease. The biologics 
available include anti-TNF agents, anti-integrins, and anti-interleukins. The 
choice of initial biologic therapy should be determined through shared 
decision-making between the patient and provider.
