[Fatal form of pericardo-myocarditis in Wissler-Fanconi syndrome].

[Article in French]

Bouhour JB, Haddak M, Lefèvre M.

The Wissler-Fanconi syndrome is an inflammatory disease of unknown origin, 
similar to Still's disease, a systemic form of juvenile arthritis. The long-term 
evolution is marked by recurrent febrile exacerbations, sometimes complicated by 
pericardo-myocarditis which usually resolves without sequellae. The authors 
report a case with chronic pericardo-myocarditis progressing over a 7 year 
period to refractory congestive cardiac failure.
