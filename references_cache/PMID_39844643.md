Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), including pigeon breeder's lung (PBL), often 
progresses from acute inflammation to fibrosis, impairing lung function and 
limiting targeted therapeutic strategies. Mechanistic studies on PBL progression 
are limited by the lack of preclinical animal models and a predominant focus on 
patient data. This study explores the immunopathological characteristics of all 
stages of PBL in mice and evaluates the therapeutic potential of human umbilical 
cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) during the non-fibrotic stage. PBL 
models are created in A/J mice through tracheal instillation of pigeon dropping 
extract (PDE) protein powder. Different doses (0.4 × 10 6, 0.8 × 10 6, and 1.6 × 
10 6 cells per animal) and frequencies (1-2 times) are administered to the 
model. The immunopathological characteristics of PBL and the therapeutic effects 
of UC-MSCs are assessed using micro-CT, pulmonary function, histopathology, cell 
counts in BALF, HYP levels, inflammatory factor levels, immunohistochemistry, 
and fibrosis marker expression in lung tissues. The results show that PDE 
exposure consistently impairs pulmonary function and increases the levels of 
inflammation and fibrosis markers as the disease progresses. Model mice 
experience non-fibrotic stages (acute inflammation) from days 0-36, mild 
fibrosis from days 37-77, and severe fibrosis from day 78 onwards. UC-MSCs, 
particularly at the highest dose (1.6 × 10 6 cells), effectively treat 
non-fibrotic PBL by improving pulmonary function (lung ventilation area 
recovers) and reducing inflammation and fibrosis. This study successfully 
establishes PBL mouse models reflecting both the acute (inflammatory) and 
chronic (fibrotic) stages, and UC-MSCs have the potential to delay fibrosis, 
providing new therapeutic options for PBL and other inflammation-induced lung 
fibrotic diseases.
