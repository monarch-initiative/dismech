Meniere's disease (MD) is a chronic, relapsing inner ear disorder characterized 
by episodes of vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and 
aural fullness. Although its etiology has long remained elusive, accumulating 
evidence implicates immune dysregulation as a central contributor to disease 
pathogenesis, particularly in patients who do not respond to standard therapies. 
This review synthesizes current insights into the immunopathological mechanisms 
underlying MD, focusing on the roles of both innate and adaptive immune 
cells-including macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells-in promoting 
inflammation, endolymphatic hydrops, and sensory dysfunction. We examine the 
contribution of these immune cells to tissue damage, along with the roles of 
cytokine signaling and immune complex deposition. Emerging immunotherapies, 
including corticosteroids, biologics, and inflammasome inhibitors, are evaluated 
for their therapeutic potential. The review also highlights promising directions 
in precision medicine, such as immune profiling, biomarker discovery, and 
stratified clinical trials aimed at personalizing treatment. By integrating 
recent immunological advances with clinical management strategies, we underscore 
the potential of immune guided approaches to transform the diagnosis, treatment, 
and long-term care of patients with MD.
