# Gene expression Classification of Colon Cancer defines six molecular subtypes with distinct clinical, molecular and survival characteristics [Expression]

## Content

From a clinical and molecular perspective, colon cancer (CC) is a heterogeneous disease but to date no classification based on high-density transcriptome data has been established. The aim of this study was to build up a robust molecular classification of mRNA expression profiles (Affymetrix U133Plus2) of a large series of 443 CC and 19 non-tumoral colorectal mucosas, and to validate it on an independent serie of 123 CC and 906 public dataset. We identified and validated six molecular subtypes in this large cohort as a combination of multiple molecular processes that complement current disease stratification based on clinicopathological variables and molecular markers. The biological relevance of these subtypes was consolidated by significant differences in survival. These insights open new perspectives for improving prognostic models and targeted therapies.
