BACKGROUND: Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive neuromuscular 
disease characterized by an onset at 6 months of age or younger, an inability to 
sit without support, and deficient levels of survival of motor neuron (SMN) 
protein. Risdiplam is an orally administered small molecule that modifies SMN2 
pre-messenger RNA splicing and increases levels of functional SMN protein in 
blood.
METHODS: We conducted an open-label study of risdiplam in infants with type 1 
SMA who were 1 to 7 months of age at enrollment. Part 1 of the study (published 
previously) determined the dose to be used in part 2 (reported here), which 
assessed the efficacy and safety of daily risdiplam as compared with no 
treatment in historical controls. The primary end point was the ability to sit 
without support for at least 5 seconds after 12 months of treatment. Key 
secondary end points were a score of 40 or higher on the Children's Hospital of 
Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND; range, 0 to 
64, with higher scores indicating better motor function), an increase of at 
least 4 points from baseline in the CHOP-INTEND score, a motor-milestone 
response as measured by Section 2 of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological 
Examination (HINE-2), and survival without permanent ventilation. For the 
secondary end points, comparisons were made with the upper boundary of 90% 
confidence intervals for natural-history data from 40 infants with type 1 SMA.
RESULTS: A total of 41 infants were enrolled. After 12 months of treatment, 12 
infants (29%) were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds, a 
milestone not attained in this disorder. The percentages of infants in whom the 
key secondary end points were met as compared with the upper boundary of 
confidence intervals from historical controls were 56% as compared with 17% for 
a CHOP-INTEND score of 40 or higher, 90% as compared with 17% for an increase of 
at least 4 points from baseline in the CHOP-INTEND score, 78% as compared with 
12% for a HINE-2 motor-milestone response, and 85% as compared with 42% for 
survival without permanent ventilation (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The most 
common serious adverse events were pneumonia, bronchiolitis, hypotonia, and 
respiratory failure.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study involving infants with type 1 SMA, risdiplam resulted 
in higher percentages of infants who met motor milestones and who showed 
improvements in motor function than the percentages observed in historical 
cohorts. Longer and larger trials are required to determine the long-term safety 
and efficacy of risdiplam in infants with type 1 SMA. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La
