We describe therapeutic monoclonal antibodies isolated from human volunteers 
vaccinated with recombinant adenovirus expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV 
GP) and boosted with modified vaccinia virus Ankara. Among 82 antibodies 
isolated from peripheral blood B cells, almost half neutralized GP pseudotyped 
influenza virus. The antibody response was diverse in gene usage and epitope 
recognition. Although close to germline in sequence, neutralizing antibodies 
with binding affinities in the nano- to pico-molar range, similar to "affinity 
matured" antibodies from convalescent donors, were found. They recognized the 
mucin-like domain, glycan cap, receptor binding region, and the base of the 
glycoprotein. A cross-reactive cocktail of four antibodies, targeting the latter 
three non-overlapping epitopes, given on day 3 of EBOV infection, completely 
protected guinea pigs. This study highlights the value of experimental vaccine 
trials as a rich source of therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies.
