Long-lasting HBV-DNA suppression is considered to be the best surrogate 
end-point of antiviral therapy in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) related 
chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, and it is a prerequisite to prevent 
liver-related complications and improve survival. Treatment with oral antiviral 
drugs in patients with HBV cirrhosis is effective in restoring liver function 
and improving survival even in those with decompensated cirrhosis. These agents 
are generally well-tolerated for long-term treatment, and several evidences have 
demonstrated that they are able to reverse liver fibrosis and prevent the 
occurrence of HCC.
