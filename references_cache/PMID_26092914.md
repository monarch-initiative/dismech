Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory CNS syndrome distinct from 
multiple sclerosis (MS) that is associated with serum aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin 
G antibodies (AQP4-IgG). Prior NMO diagnostic criteria required optic nerve and 
spinal cord involvement but more restricted or more extensive CNS involvement 
may occur. The International Panel for NMO Diagnosis (IPND) was convened to 
develop revised diagnostic criteria using systematic literature reviews and 
electronic surveys to facilitate consensus. The new nomenclature defines the 
unifying term NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD), which is stratified further by 
serologic testing (NMOSD with or without AQP4-IgG). The core clinical 
characteristics required for patients with NMOSD with AQP4-IgG include clinical 
syndromes or MRI findings related to optic nerve, spinal cord, area postrema, 
other brainstem, diencephalic, or cerebral presentations. More stringent 
clinical criteria, with additional neuroimaging findings, are required for 
diagnosis of NMOSD without AQP4-IgG or when serologic testing is unavailable. 
The IPND also proposed validation strategies and achieved consensus on pediatric 
NMOSD diagnosis and the concepts of monophasic NMOSD and opticospinal MS.
