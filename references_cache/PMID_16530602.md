Lupus nephritis is one of the more serious manifestations of the systemic 
autoimmune disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and is associated with 
considerable morbidity and even mortality. Treatment remains problematic, 
particularly in terms of controlling the underlying disease process while at the 
same time preventing unacceptable side effects of therapy. In recent years, 
clinical trials have started to define optimum regimens of the immunosuppressive 
agents presently in use. The etiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus 
erythematosus and lupus nephritis still are understood incompletely. 
Nevertheless, insights gained from basic science research in both animals and 
human beings now are being translated into newer therapies that have the 
potential to be safer and more specific than those currently available.
