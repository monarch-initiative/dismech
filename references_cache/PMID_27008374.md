Severe dengue pathogenesis is not fully understood, but high levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with dengue disease severity. In 
this study, the cytokine levels in 171 sera from Mexican patients with primary 
dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) from dengue virus (DENV) 1 
(n = 116) or 2 (n = 55) were compared. DF and DHF were defined according to the 
patient's clinical condition, the primary infections as indicated by IgG 
enzymatic immunoassay negative results, and the infecting serotype as assessed 
by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Samples were 
analysed for circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-12p70, interferon (IFN)-γ, 
tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, and IL-8 using a commercial cytometric 
bead array. Significantly higher IFN-γ levels were found in patients with DHF 
than those with DF. However, significantly higher IL-12p70, TNF-α, and IL-6 
levels were associated with DHF only in patients who were infected with DENV2 
but not with DENV1. Moreover, patients with DF who were infected with DENV1 
showed higher levels of IL-12p70, TNF-α, and IL-6 than patients with DHF early 
after-fever onset. The IL-8 levels were similar in all cases regardless of the 
clinical condition or infection serotype. These results suggest that the 
association between high proinflammatory cytokine levels and dengue disease 
severity does not always stand, and it once again highlights the complex nature 
of DHF pathogenesis.
