# A Randomized Double-blinded Pilot Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab Versus Placebo in Patients With Netherton Syndrome

## Content

To date, there are no effective therapy for the management of Netherton Syndrome (NS) Patients use emollients with a limited efficacy on scaling and no efficacy on skin inflammation and pruritus. They may also use topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors in case of eczematous lesions. The use of therapies targeting skin inflammation has been reported in a few case reports. Their efficacy is very limited and their uses are limited because of the chronicity of the disease, the impaired skin barrier function and the risk for skin infections and skin cancers. Therefore, there is a huge medical need for novel therapies in NS.The expected consequences of this study are that a 16-week course of dupilumab will be more effective than placebo for the treatment of moderate to severe NS Dupilumab could therefore improve skin condition and quality of life.
