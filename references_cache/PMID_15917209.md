There has been tremendous progress in the past few years in understanding the 
molecular basis of nephronophthisis, and it is now evident that the disease is 
characterized by both clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Within the three 
different clinical forms there is a large spectrum of phenotypes, which have 
been associated, to date, with five gene defects. These genes encode proteins 
that localize in different cell compartments - in particular, to the primary 
apical cilia - as is the case for virtually all gene products involved in cystic 
kidney diseases. Two animal models with mutations in the mouse orthologs of the 
genes involved in the adolescent and infantile forms also exist. These models 
have been of considerable help in deciphering disease pathogenesis.
