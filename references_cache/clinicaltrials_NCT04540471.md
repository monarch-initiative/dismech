Comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation for breast cancer consist of interdisciplinary team care but few researchers investigate the efficacy of music therapy, which have shown some benefits in breast cancer rehabilitation. According to previous research, music therapy has been proposed to improve quality of life, as well as depression and stress of breast cancer patients. However, to the best of our knowledge, only few studies have investigated the impact of music therapy among health-related parameter of patient with breast cancer. Considering the fact that music therapy had merely no adverse events, we assume music therapy is an optimal add-on therapy for patient with breast cancer. Therefore, we plan to conduct a study to evaluate the impact of music therapy on anxiety, and fatigue on patients with breast cancer.
