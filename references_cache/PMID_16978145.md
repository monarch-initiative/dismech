Different forms of participation of proteolytic enzymes in pathogenesis and 
plant defense are reviewed. Together with extracellular proteinases, 
phytopathogenic microorganisms produce specific effectors with proteolytic 
activity and are able to act on proteins inside the plant cell. In turn, plants 
use both extracellular and intracellular proteinases for defense against 
phytopathogenic microorganisms. Among the latter, a special role belongs to 
vacuolar processing enzymes (legumains), which perform the function of caspases 
in the plant cell.
