# Expanded Access to Provide ARQ 092 for the Treatment of Overgrowth Diseases and/or Vascular Anomalies With Genetic Alterations of the PI3K/AKT Pathway

## Content

ARQ 092 is being investigated for patients with overgrowth diseases and/or vascular anomalies with genetic alterations of the PI3K/AKT pathway and may be available for patients who are ineligible for an ongoing ARQ 092 clinical trial or have other considerations that prevent access to ARQ 092 through an existing clinical trial.
