Contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) is the process by which cells in vitro 
change their direction of migration upon contact with another cell. Here, we 
revisit the concept that CIL plays a central role in the migration of single 
cells and in collective migration, during both health and disease. Importantly, 
malignant cells exhibit a diminished CIL behaviour which allows them to invade 
healthy tissues. Accumulating evidence indicates that CIL occurs in vivo and 
that regulation of small Rho GTPases is important in the collapse of cell 
protrusions upon cell contact, the first step of CIL. Finally, we propose 
possible cell surface proteins that could be involved in the initial contact 
that regulates Rho GTPases during CIL.
