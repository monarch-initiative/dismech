The Capgras phenomenon.

Merrin EL, Silberfarb PM.

The underlying diagnosis of Capgras delusion is not found to be exclusively 
paranoid schizophrenia, nor is the sex exclusively female, as once was believed. 
Organic factors play a predominant role in many patients, and 41% of the cases 
are males. The age at diagnosis in those considered to be schizophrenic is older 
than is usually expected.
