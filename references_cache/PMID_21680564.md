A review is presented of key clinical papers published in Thorax and elsewhere 
between 2008 and April 2011 which have advanced our understanding of cystic 
fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia and non-CF bronchiectasis. Studies 
were identified through searches of the Thorax archive and the Medline database. 
Within the field of CF, the following key themes were studied: diagnosis in 
equivocal CF, assessment of CF lung disease, novel therapies addressing the 
basic defect in CF, maintenance pulmonary therapies, management of early 
Pseudomonas infection, the microbiology of CF lung disease, renal impairment in 
CF and controversies in lung transplantation in CF.
