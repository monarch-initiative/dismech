Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital malformation of 
gastrointestinal tract. It can cause complications in the form of ulceration, 
haemorrhage, intussusception, intestinal obstruction, perforation and, very 
rarely, vesicodiverticular fistulae and tumours. These complications, especially 
bleeding, are more common in the paediatric age group than in adults; however it 
is not uncommon to miss the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum in adults. Here, 
we reviewed the literature regarding the complications of this forgotten 
clinical entity in adults with potential diagnostic difficulties and management 
strategies.
