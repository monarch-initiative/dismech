A significant barrier to the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is 
a limited understanding of disease mechanisms. Heterozygous missense variants in 
PPP2R5D cause Houge-Janssens syndrome 1, a rare NDD characterized by 
macrocephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, autism 
spectrum disorder, and early-onset Parkinson disease. This study investigated 
the impact of pathogenic PPP2R5D variants on neuronal development and evaluated 
allele-specific knockdown as a potential therapeutic strategy. Induced 
pluripotent stem cells derived from individuals carrying the E198K and E420K 
variants, along with CRISPR-corrected isogenic controls, were differentiated 
into neural progenitors and cortical glutamatergic neurons. Patient-derived 
neural progenitors were hyper-proliferative, and glutamatergic neurons 
differentiated from these cells exhibited increased neurite outgrowth. Notably, 
neuronal overgrowth phenotypes were not observed in neurons lacking PPP2R5D, 
suggesting the disorder does not result from loss of function. RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq) of glutamatergic neurons derived from patient lines compared to their 
isogenic controls revealed disruptions in pathways critical for neuronal 
development, synaptic signaling, and axon guidance. To target pathogenic 
transcripts, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were designed to selectively 
knock down the E198K allele, the most common disease-causing missense variant. 
The most effective ASOs reversed neurite outgrowth defects in patient-derived 
neurons. These findings uncover molecular mechanisms underlying PPP2R5D-related 
NDDs and support allele-specific knockdown as a potential therapeutic approach.
