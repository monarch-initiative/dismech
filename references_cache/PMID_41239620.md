RATIONALE: Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by persistent 
energy restriction, distorted body image perception, and intense fear of weight 
gain. It frequently leads to severe malnutrition and multisystemic impairment. 
Prolonged energy deficiency disrupts hematopoietic function, resulting in 
pancytopenia. Refeeding syndrome represents a significant complication during 
nutritional support for anorexia nervosa patients, with hypophosphatemia 
potentially causing further hematopoietic damage.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 32-year-old female patient with anorexia nervosa was 
admitted for "pancytopenia and chronic weight loss," presenting with a body mass 
index of 11.7 kg/m2. Four years prior, workplace stress triggered abnormal 
eating behaviors, resulting in a rapid weight loss from 45 to 30 kg within 2 
months. Over the preceding 2 days, she reported worsening discomfort in her back 
and precordial region.
DIAGNOSES: Investigations revealed pancytopenia, although a previous bone marrow 
aspiration had shown no abnormalities. The patient was diagnosed with anorexia 
nervosa and pancytopenia secondary to refeeding syndrome.
INTERVENTIONS: On day 3, phosphate reached a minimum of 0.32 mmol/L (enteral 
nutrition at 20 kcal/kg/d). A stepwise protocol was initiated, increasing 
enteral nutrition by 5 kcal/kg every 24 hours, reaching 30 kcal/kg/d by day 5 
and maintained thereafter. Concurrent intravenous phosphate supplementation (0.6 
mmol/kg/d) was initiated.
OUTCOMES: At discharge, body weight increased to 31 kg with an elevated 
reticulocyte count, though the white blood cell count remained low. At 1-month 
follow-up, hemoglobin rose to 80 g/L and white blood cells to 3.1 × 109/L. 
However, issues persisted with inadequate protein intake and noncompliance with 
psychological interventions; the patient refused bone marrow aspiration and 
outpatient psychological therapy.
LESSONS: A stepwise calorie escalation protocol effectively corrects 
hypophosphatemia in refeeding syndrome. Treatment requires multidisciplinary 
management and psychological support. Hematopoietic recovery in anorexia nervosa 
patients with refeeding syndrome necessitates an extended duration. The impact 
of higher calorie feeding on hematopoiesis warrants further investigation.
