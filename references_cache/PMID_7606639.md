The kidney can be considered as both culprit and victim in the hypertensive 
process. Deranged renal function contributes to the development of arterial 
hypertension and of secondary vascular damage at the glomerular and arteriolar 
level and accounts for the development of progressive nephrosclerosis. The most 
common alteration of renal function observed in humans from the early stages of 
essential hypertension is the presence of renal vasoconstriction. This can be 
accompanied by hyperuricaemia and increased urinary excretion of enzymes such as 
N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and proteins such as albumin and beta 
2-microglobulin. Later, a progressive fall in glomerular filtration rate, 
sometimes accompanied by proteinuria, can be observed if high blood pressure 
persists.
