Vitiligo in children is a distinct subset of vitiligo and differs from adult 
vitiligo. Characteristic features include family history of autoimmune or 
endocrine disease, higher incidence of segmental vitiligo, development of early 
or premature graying, increased incidence of autoantibodies and poor response to 
topical PUVA. The exact prevalence of vitiligo in children varies between 0.1-4% 
of the world population and seems to be higher in India than in other countries 
and it occurs more frequently in females. Around 12% to 35% of pediatric 
vitiligo patients have family members with the disease. The most common type of 
vitiligo in pediatric patients is vitiligo vulgaris, representing 78% of cases. 
The most commonly associated autoimmune disease is thyroiditis. Phototherapy and 
topical corticosteroids are the most commonly used treatments for adult vitiligo 
but are less useful in the pediatric population.
