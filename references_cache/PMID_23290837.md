OBJECTIVE: This paper examines how the monovalent varicella vaccine for 
children, with an adolescent catch-up dose, was introduced into Australia's 
National Immunisation Program (NIP), focusing on programme implementation.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants involved 
in programme implementation. Key themes from interviews were identified through 
content analysis. Childhood coverage was assessed using data from the Australian 
Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) with adolescent coverage obtained from 
state/territory immunisation programmes. Seroprevalence data were analysed from 
national serosurveys conducted before and after programme commencement.
RESULTS: Implementation challenges for both parents and providers included: (a) 
parental report of previous infection as an exclusion criterion; (b) introducing 
a vaccine on its own at 18 months of age; and (c) adding the adolescent dose 
into existing school-based vaccination programmes with parental reported 
exclusion criteria. Despite these challenges, coverage rapidly reached 83% by 24 
months of age and 30-33% for the adolescent catch-up dose. When considered in 
conjunction with estimated pre-vaccination natural immunity in both target 
groups (20% and 83%, respectively) coverage can be considered high. The 
serosurvey under-estimated coverage in 2-year-old children but was useful to 
assess trends in population immunity.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of a single dose of monovalent varicella vaccine at 
18 months of age and a school-based catch-up programme at 11-13 years of age 
successfully achieved high coverage, notwithstanding some challenges. Reported 
natural infection has been an exclusion criterion for vaccination, but as the 
programme matures and circulation of wild-type virus decreases, the need for 
this warrants consideration. There is a need for sensitive laboratory assays to 
measure vaccine-induced immunity at a population level.
