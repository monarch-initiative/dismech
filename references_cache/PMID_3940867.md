Evoked potentials in multiple sclerosis before and after high-dose 
methylprednisolone infusion.

Smith T, Zeeberg I, Sjö O.

We studied 8 patients with definite multiple sclerosis (3 with acute relapse, 5 
with progression), and 2 patients with acute optic neuritis, who were treated 
with methylprednisolone infusions, 1 g daily for 3 days. Visual, brain 
stem-auditory and somatosensory-evoked potentials were used to test the effect 
of therapy. There were no manifest changes of the evoked potentials parameters 
parallel to the clinical effect of high-dose therapy.
