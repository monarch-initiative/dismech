Glaucoma is a long-term ocular neuropathy defined by optic disc or retinal nerve 
fiber structural abnormalities and visual-field defects. Treatment for glaucoma 
consists of reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) to an acceptable target range to 
prevent further optic-nerve damage. Currently available treatments include 
topical drug (single then multidrug combinations) followed, for those patients 
on maximal tolerated medical therapy who still need additional IOP reduction, by 
laser treatments. These included laser iridotomy, laser trabeculoplasty, laser 
iridoplasty, laser cyclophotocoagulation. Although the various types of laser 
enjoyed great success as glaucoma therapy for many years, recently the excimer 
laser trabeculotomy is a promising IOP-lowering technique.
