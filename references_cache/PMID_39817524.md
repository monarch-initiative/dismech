BACKGROUND: Sengers syndrome is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA 
depletion syndrome characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital 
cataracts, skeletal myopathy, exercise intolerance, and lactic acidosis. 
Dysfunction of acylglycerol kinase (AGK) is responsible for the disease, and 
several AGK gene variants have been reported.
METHODS: We employed a comprehensive genomic analysis approach, including 
whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing, combined with various bioinformatics 
tools.
RESULTS: Our analysis successfully diagnosed Sengers syndrome in a patient by 
detecting a known pathogenic variant and a previously unreported large deletion 
involving the AGK gene in a segmental duplication.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining multiple 
genomic analysis approaches for the accurate diagnosis of Sengers syndrome, 
particularly in cases involving complex genetic variations such as large 
deletions in segmental duplications.
