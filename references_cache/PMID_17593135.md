Based on a systematic PubMed search, this short review addresses why intestinal 
permeability may be important in the pathobiology of irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS), the evidence of abnormal permeability in patients with IBS, and the pros 
and cons of the different probe molecules available to assess intestinal 
permeability. While a subgroup of patients with IBS appears to have evidence of 
increased intestinal permeability, improvements in the methods and validation 
are key to further research in this field in order to better understand 
intestinal barrier functions in IBS.
