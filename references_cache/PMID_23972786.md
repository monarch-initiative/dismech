A key question for urea cycle disorders is their incidence. In the United States 
two UCDs, argininosuccinic synthetase and lyase deficiency, are currently 
detected by newborn screening. We used newborn screening data on over 6million 
births and data from the large US and European longitudinal registries to 
determine how common these conditions are. The incidence for the United States 
is predicted to be 1 urea cycle disorder patient for every 35,000 births 
presenting about 113 new patients per year across all age groups.
