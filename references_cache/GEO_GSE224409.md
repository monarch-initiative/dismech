# Transcriptome profiling of lymph nodes from Spink5 conditional knock-out mice.

## Content

We generated a viable mouse model of Netherton syndrome by conditional ablation of Spink5 gene in the epidermis. To study the systemic inflammation phenotype of this mouse model at the molecular level, we induced Spink5 deletion in the skin of young adult mice and collected inguinal lymph nodes for transcriptome analyses.
