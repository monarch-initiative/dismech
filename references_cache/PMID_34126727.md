Objective: To analyze the clinical and genetic characteristics of clinical 
subtypes of non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Methods: It was a 
cohort study. Patients with non-obstructive HCM admitted to Fuwai Hospital, 
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, from January 1999 to April 2019 were 
enrolled. According to the characteristics of cardiac morphology and function 
shown by echocardiography, the patients were divided into common type, dilated 
type, restricted type and reduced ejection fraction type. The clinical data of 
the patients were recorded, and 8 sarcomere pathogenic genes were screened by 
full exon sequencing or panel sequencing. Patienst were followed up and 
cardiovascular endpoint events were recorded. Results: A total of 815 patients 
with non-obstructive HCM were enrolled, including 27 (3.3%) restricted type, 51 
(6.3%) dilated type, 30 (3.7%) reduced ejection fraction type and 707 (86.7%) 
common type. A total of 704 out of 815 patients underwent genetic testing. Among 
them, 299 (42.5%) patients carried at least 1 sarcomere gene mutation. MYBPC3 
and MYH7 mutation accounted for 42.1% (126/299) and 35.8% (107/299) 
respectively. 66.7% (16/24) of the patients with restricted type carried 
sarcomere gene mutation, which was higher than that in patients with dilated 
type (36.4% (16/44)) and in common type (41.5% (250/602), P=0.015). Among the 
patients with reduced ejection fraction, 56.7% (17/30) patients carried 
sarcomere gene mutations, 23.3% (7/30) carried multiple sarcomere mutations, 
which was higher than that in restricted type (8.3% (2/24)), in dilated type 
(9.1% (4/44)) and in common type 4.2% ((24/577), P<0.001). MYH7 and MYBPC3 were 
the main mutation gene types of all clinical subtypes, and the genotypes were 
similar among groups (all P>0.05). Seven hundred and three out 815 patients were 
followed up for 2.9 (1.4, 4.0) years. There were 53(7.5%) cardiovascular death. 
Cardiovascular death occurred in 5.0% (29/578) patients with common type, 13.0% 
(3/23) patients with restricted type, 16.3% (7/43) patients with dilated type 
and 46.7% (14/30) patients with decreased ejection fraction. Univariate Cox 
proportional hazards model analysis showed that the risk of cardiovascular death 
in patients with restricted, dilated and reduced ejection fraction type was 
higher than that in patients with common type (P<0.001). After adjusting for 
gender, age of onset, body mass index, history of hypertension, coronary heart 
disease and diabetes, multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis 
showed that the HR of cardiovascular death in patients with restricted, dilated 
and reduced ejection fraction type were 5.454 (95%CI 1.137-26.157, P=0.034) and 
6.597 (95%CI 1.632-26.667, P=0.008) and 9.028 (95%CI 2.201-37.039, P=0.002) 
respectively, as compared to patients with common type. Conclusions: Most of the 
patients with non-obstructive HCM are common type, featured by mild clinical 
manifestations and good prognosis. Although the proportion of restricted type 
and dilated type is relatively low, and cardiac systolic function is mostly 
preserved, the clinical phenotype and prognosis of these patients are similarly 
severe and poor as patients with reduced ejection fraction. The genotypes are 
similar in different clinical subtypes, but the proportion of patients with 
sarcomere gene mutation is higher in restricted type, and the proportion of 
patients with multiple sarcomere gene mutation is higher in decreased ejection 
fraction type.

Publisher: 目的： 分析非梗阻性肥厚型心肌病（HCM）各临床亚型的临床及遗传学特征。 方法： 
该研究为队列研究。入选1999年1月至2019年4月在中国医学科学院阜外医院就诊的非梗阻性HCM患者。根据超声心动图所示心脏形态及功能特点将入选患者分为普通型、扩张型、限制型及射血分数降低型。记录入选患者的临床资料，并应用全外显子测序或Panel测序筛查8个肌小节致病基因。随访并记录心血管死亡终点事件。 
结果： 
共入选非梗阻性HCM患者815例，其中限制型27例（3.3%），扩张型51例（6.3%），射血分数降低型30例（3.7%），普通型707例（86.7%）。815例患者中共704例进行了基因检测，其中299例（42.5%）患者携带至少1个肌小节基因致病突变，MYBPC3和MYH7分别占42.1%（126/299）和35.8%（107/299）。限制型的患者中66.7%（16/24）携带肌小节基因致病突变，较扩张型的36.4%（16/44）及普通型的41.5%（250/602）高（P均<0.05）。射血分数降低型患者中56.7%（17/30）携带肌小节基因致病突变，23.3%（7/30）携带多个肌小节突变，较限制型的8.3%（2/24）、扩张型的9.1%（4/44）及普通型的4.2%（24/577）更高（P均<0.001）。各临床亚型患者携带的突变基因类型均以MYH7及MYBPC3为主，各分型间差异无统计学意义（P均>0.05）。对815例患者中的703例进行了随访，随访时间2.9（1.4，4.0）年，共53例（7.5%）患者发生心血管死亡终点事件。普通型患者中5.0%（29/578）发生心血管死亡，限制型患者中13.0%（3/23）发生心血管死亡，扩张型患者中16.3%（7/43）发生心血管死亡，射血分数降低型患者中46.7%（14/30）发生心血管死亡。单因素Cox比例风险模型分析结果显示，限制型、扩张型及射血分数降低型患者的心血管死亡风险均高于普通型（P<0.001），但三种类型之间差异无统计学意义。多因素Cox比例风险模型分析结果显示，校正了性别、发病年龄、体重指数、高血压病史、冠心病病史、糖尿病病史后，限制型、扩张型和射血分数降低型患者心血管死亡风险相对于普通型的HR分别为5.454（95%CI 
1.137~26.157，P=0.034）、6.597（95%CI 1.632~26.667，P=0.008）和9.028（95%CI 
2.201~37.039，P=0.002）。 结论： 
非梗阻性HCM患者大多数为普通型，临床表现轻且预后良好，而限制型、扩张型虽占比较低且未出现心脏收缩功能降低，但与射血分数降低型一样临床表型均可较为严重、预后不佳。各临床亚型患者携带突变基因类型虽无差异，但限制型患者携带肌小节突变比例更高，射血分数降低型患者携带多个肌小节突变比例较高。.
