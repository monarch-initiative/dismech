Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic 
anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. HUS can be secondary to 
multiple etiologies such as infections, medications, and immune processes. A 
rare, yet significant, etiology of HUS includes acute Clostridium difficile 
colitis. Here, we present a case of atypical HUS secondary to acute C. difficile 
colitis, successfully treated with hemodialysis and systemic corticosteroids. It 
is imperative that clinicians are cognizant of C. difficile-associated HUS given 
the overall rising incidence of acute C. difficile infections.
