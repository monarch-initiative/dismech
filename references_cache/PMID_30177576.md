Symptoms specific to schizophrenia include self-disturbances, delusional 
perception and loosening of associations. Self-disturbances in schizophrenia can 
be explained from the standpoint of an abnormal sense of agency, such as thought 
broadcasting as an over-attribution of agency and thought insertion as an 
under-attribution of agency. Delusional perception is often accompanied by 
impairment of perceptual organization; delusional mood and delusions might 
result from the reorganization of the fragmented perceptual field, as well as a 
loss of reality. Impairment of perceptual organization is frequently related to 
the loosening of associations.
