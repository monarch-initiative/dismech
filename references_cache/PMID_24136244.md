Hyposmia, identified as reduced sensitivity to odor, is a common non-motor 
symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that antedates the typical motor symptoms by 
several years. It occurs in ∼90% of early-stage cases of PD. In addition to the 
high prevalence, the occurrence of hyposmia may also predict a higher risk of 
PD. Investigations into hyposmia and its relationship with PD may help elucidate 
the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This review provides an update of 
olfactory dysfunction in PD and its potential as a biomarker for this 
devastating disease.
