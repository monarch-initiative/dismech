The aim of the meta-analysis was to provide more solid evidence for the 
reliability of the new classification. A systematic literature search was 
performed using PubMed, Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval 
System, and Google Scholar up to August 2012. A pooled odds ratio (OR) was 
calculated using either a random-effect or a fixed-effect model. A total of 16 
papers were identified. Among the 11 factors studied, five symptoms demonstrated 
an increased risk for SDD, including bleeding [OR: 13.617; 95% confidence 
interval (CI): 3.281, 56.508], vomiting/nausea (OR: 1.692; 95% CI: 1.256, 
2.280), abdominal pain (OR: 2.278; 95% CI: 1.631, 3.182), skin rashes (OR: 
2.031; 95% CI: 1.269, 3.250), and hepatomegaly (OR: 4.751; 95% CI: 1.769, 
12.570). Among the four bleeding-related symptoms including hematemesis, melena, 
gum bleeding, and epistaxis, only hematemesis (OR: 6.174; 95% CI: 2.66, 14.334; 
P < 0.001) and melena (OR: 10.351; 95% CI: 3.065, 34.956; P < 0.001) were 
significantly associated with SDD. No significant associations with SDD were 
found for gender, lethargy, retroorbital pain, diarrhea, or tourniquet test, 
whereas headache appeared protective (OR: 0.555; 95% CI: 0.455, 0.676). The 
meta-analysis suggests that bleeding (hematemesis/melena), vomiting/nausea, 
abdominal pain, skin rashes, and hepatomegaly may predict the development of SDD 
in patients with DF, while headache may predict otherwise.
