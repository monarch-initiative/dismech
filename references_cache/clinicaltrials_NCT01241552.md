# A Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Adaptive Design Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of a Single Infusion of MK-3415 (Human Monoclonal Antibody to Clostridium Difficile Toxin A), MK-6072 (Human Monoclonal Antibody to Clostridium Difficile Toxin B), and MK-3415A (Human Monoclonal Antibodies to Clostridium Difficile Toxin A and Toxin B) in Patients Receiving Antibiotic Therapy for Clostridium Difficile Infection (MODIFY I)

## Content

This study will investigate whether: 1) treatment with MK-3415A in addition to standard of care (SOC) antibiotic therapy will decrease Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) recurrence as compared to treatment with MK-6072 or MK-3415, 2) treatment with MK-3415A, MK-6072, or MK-3415, in addition to SOC antibiotic therapy will decrease CDI recurrence as compared to placebo, and 3) MK-3415A, MK-6072, and MK-3415 will be generally well tolerated in participants receiving SOC therapy for CDI as compared to placebo.
