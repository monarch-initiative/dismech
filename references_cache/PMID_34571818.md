Dengue fever is a viral mosquito-borne infection and a major international 
public health concern. With 2.5 billion people at risk of acquiring the 
infection around the world, disease severity is influenced by the immunological 
status of the individual, seronegative or seropositive, prior to natural 
infection. Caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes, DENV-1 
to DENV-4, infection by one serotype confers life-long immunity to that serotype 
and a period of temporary cross-immunity (TCI) to other serotypes. The clinical 
response on exposure to a second serotype is complex with the so-called 
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) process, a disease augmentation phenomenon 
when pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection do not neutralize but 
rather enhance the new infection, used to explain the etiology of severe 
disease. In this paper, we present a minimalistic mathematical model framework 
developed to describe qualitatively the dengue immunological response mediated 
by antibodies. Three models are analyzed and compared: (i) primary dengue 
infection, (ii) secondary dengue infection with the same (homologous) dengue 
virus and (iii) secondary dengue infection with a different (heterologous) 
dengue virus. We explore the features of viral replication, antibody production 
and infection clearance over time. The model is developed based on body cells 
and free virus interactions resulting in infected cells activating antibody 
production. Our mathematical results are qualitatively similar to the ones 
described in the empiric immunology literature, providing insights into the 
immunopathogenesis of severe disease. Results presented here are of use for 
future research directions to evaluate the impact of dengue vaccines.
