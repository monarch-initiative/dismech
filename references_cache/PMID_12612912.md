BACKGROUND & AIMS: The biliary epithelium is involved both in bile production 
and in the inflammatory/reparative response to liver damage. Recent data 
indicate that inflammatory aggression to intrahepatic bile ducts results in 
chronic progressive cholestasis.
METHODS: To understand the effects of nitric oxide on cholangiocyte secretion 
and biliary tract pathophysiology we have investigated: (1) the effects of 
proinflammatory cytokines on NO production and expression of the inducible 
nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), (2) the effects of NO on cAMP-dependent secretory 
mechanisms, and (3) the immunohistochemical expression of NOS2 in a number of 
human chronic liver diseases.
RESULTS: Our results show that: (1) tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and 
interferon (IFN)-gamma, synergically stimulate NO production in cultured 
cholangiocytes through an increase in NOS2 gene and protein expression; (2) 
micromolar concentrations of NO inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production by 
adenylyl cyclase (AC), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent fluid 
secretion, and cAMP-dependent Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) transport mediated by cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and anion exchanger isoform 
2, respectively; (3) cholestatic effects of NO and of proinflammatory cytokines 
are prevented by NOS-2 inhibitors and by agents 
(manganese(III)-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin [MnTBAP], urate, trolox) able 
to block the formation of reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS); (4) NOS2 
expression is increased significantly in the biliary epithelium of patients with 
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the 
biliary epithelium to generate NO, via NOS2 induction, and that NO causes 
ductular cholestasis by a RNOS-mediated inhibition of AC and of cAMP-dependent 
HCO(3)(-) and Cl(-) secretory mechanisms. This pathogenetic sequence may 
contribute to ductal cholestasis in inflammatory cholangiopathies.
