Inevitably, a small proportion of patients with systematic hypertension will 
develop hypertensive crisis at some point. Hypertensive crises can be divided 
into hypertensive emergency or hypertensive urgency according to the presence or 
lack of acute target organ damage. In this review, we discuss cardiovascular 
hypertensive emergencies, including acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, 
congestive heart failure, and sympathomimetic hypertensive crises, including 
those caused by cocaine use. Each presents in a unique fashion, although some 
hypertensive emergency patients report nonspecific symptoms. Treatment includes 
several effective and rapid-acting medications to safely reduce the blood 
pressure, protect remaining end-organ function, relieve symptoms, minimize the 
risk of complications, and thereby improve patient outcomes.
