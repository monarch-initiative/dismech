We present a case of a male with severe mental retardation, seizure disorder, 
and absence/hypoplasia of the thumb and great toe nails. This combination of 
clinical findings has been reported only once previously. We suggest it 
represents a distinct syndrome. Our case has the additional finding of broad 
thumbs.
