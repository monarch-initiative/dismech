OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of 
taurodontism in a group of adult dental patients in Northwest China with the aid 
of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).
METHODS: This study used Shifman and Chanannel's criteria to statistically 
analyze the prevalence of taurodontism in the premolars and molars of the 
Chinese population. CBCT images of 5488 teeth from 580 subjects of Chinese 
origin were evaluated. The measured data were statistically analyzed and the 
chi-square test was also used to compare the prevalence of taurodontism between 
male and female subjects and between the upper and lower jaws (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: Taurodontism was detected in 169 patients, with a prevalence of 29.14%, 
of which 27.24% were males and 30.65% were females. The chi-square test showed 
that there was no significant difference between males and females (P > 0.05). 
Taurodontism was found in 7.45% of all teeth examined. Taurodonts were 
significantly more common in the maxilla (9.06%) than in the mandible (5.15%) 
(P < 0.001), and the maxillary second molar (25.18%) was the most common tooth 
affected. According to morphology, hypotaurodonts were the most common (60.39%) 
among taurodontic teeth.
CONCLUSIONS: Taurodontism was relatively common in the Chinese population and 
was almost equally distributed between males and females. The maxillary second 
molar was the most common tooth of all taurodonts measured, and taurodonts were 
significantly more common in the maxilla than in the mandible. Hypotaurodontism 
was the most common form of taurodontism. Our study provides a reference for 
dental deformities in the Chinese population and the diagnosis and treatment of 
taurodontism.
