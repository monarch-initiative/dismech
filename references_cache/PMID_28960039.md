Klinefelter's syndrome (KS) is a genetic syndrome that presents with 
hypogonadism and is associated with metabolic syndrome. Patients demonstrating 
hypogonadism show a greater prevalence of metabolic syndrome due to changes in 
body composition. We aimed to determine the association between KS and 
dyslipidemia. The KS group comprised 55 patients who visited the infertility 
clinic for an infertility evaluation and were confirmed as having a diagnosis of 
KS. The control group comprised 120 patients who visited the clinic for health 
screening. Patient characteristics were compared between the two groups with 
respect to height, weight, body mass index (BMI), testosterone, total 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) levels. Height and weight were 
significantly greater in patients belonging to the KS group, but no 
statistically significant difference was found with respect to the BMI. 
Testosterone levels in patients belonging to the KS group were significantly 
lower compared to the control group (2.4 ± 2.6 vs. 5.2 ± 1.8 ng/mL, P < 0.001). 
Compared to the control group, TG levels in patients belonging to the KS group 
were increased (134.9 ± 127.8 vs. 187.9 ± 192.1 mg/dL, P = 0.004) and HDL 
cholesterol was significantly decreased (51.2 ± 22.0 vs. 44.0 ± 9.5 mg/dL, P = 
0.009). LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol were not significantly different 
between the two groups (P = 0.076 and P = 0.256, respectively). Significant 
differences were noted between patients belonging to the KS group and normal 
control group with respect to elevated TG and decreased HDL cholesterol levels.
