Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for 
dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they 
differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate 
diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, 
frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although use 
of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select 
conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, 
acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in 
melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.
