Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by inappropriate left 
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the setting of a nondilated left ventricle. HCM 
is often associated with asymmetric LVH, a family history of HCM, sarcomeric 
genetic mutations, and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. There is a 
wide clinical variability in HCM presenting during childhood and a relative lack 
of data on the pediatric population. This review will cover HCM presenting in 
infancy, childhood, and adolescence.
