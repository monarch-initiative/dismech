BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease entity characterized by 
marked heterogeneity in morphology and natural history. Most of our knowledge of 
the natural history of this disorder derives from the study of hospital-based 
populations and is influenced by referral bias. Therefore, this population-based 
study was undertaken to examine the natural history of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy among unselected residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, confirmed by 
echocardiography, were identified by use of the resources of the Rochester 
Epidemiology Project. Patients with the echocardiographic features of 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but with long-standing hypertension requiring drug 
therapy were categorized as having hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Baseline clinical details and follow-up events were obtained by retrospective 
chart review. Thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy and 24 with hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Eight 
additional patients were first diagnosed at autopsy. The mean age of the 37 
patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was 59 +/- 20 years (range, 1 week to 
92 years); the mean ventricular septal thickness was 17.5 +/- 3 mm. Follow-up 
was obtained for a median of 7.7 years (range, 45 days to 17.2 years). The 1- 
and 5-year survival rates were 95% and 92%, respectively; these rates did not 
differ from those of an age- and sex-matched population (P = NS). The annual 
risk of cardiac death was 0.7%. The mean age of patients with hypertensive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was 79 +/- 8 years (range, 62 to 91 years), and the 
mean ventricular septal thickness was 19 +/- 2.5 mm. Follow-up was obtained for 
a median of 2.8 years (range, 4 days to 16.7 years). The 1- and 5-year survival 
rates were 75% and 43%, respectively, which differed sharply from the expected 
rates of 94% and 70% (P = .0028). The annual risk of cardiac death was 5%. 
Atrial fibrillation and evidence for myocardial infarction on ECG, use of 
digoxin and diuretics, and a high New York Heart Association functional class at 
presentation were all associated with decreased survival by multivariate 
analysis for both groups combined. A history of myocardial infarction, atrial 
fibrillation, and mitral annual calcification at presentation were associated 
with cardiac death.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a more benign disease than 
previously reported from tertiary referral centers. Patients assessed as having 
hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy represent a subset at higher risk for 
cardiac and noncardiac death, with an overall decreased survival rate.
