There are many thousands of hereditary diseases in humans, each of which has a 
specific combination of phenotypic features, but computational analysis of 
phenotypic data has been hampered by lack of adequate computational data 
structures. Therefore, we have developed a Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) with 
over 8000 terms representing individual phenotypic anomalies and have annotated 
all clinical entries in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man with the terms of 
the HPO. We show that the HPO is able to capture phenotypic similarities between 
diseases in a useful and highly significant fashion.
