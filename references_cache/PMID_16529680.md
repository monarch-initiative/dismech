Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease that can lead to many serious complications 
if not properly managed. The patient and physician must work together to 
optimize glucose control involving both insulin administration and caloric 
intake. Exercise has numerous benefits and the type 1 diabetic should take 
advantage of these benefits. Athletes with type 1 diabetes are capable of 
undertaking a wide array of exercise activities and there are no longer firm 
contraindications to certain sports for diabetic patients. This article will aid 
the sports physician in understanding the effects of exercise on diabetes, 
educating patients to exercise safely, advising when exercise is 
contraindicated, and providing guidelines for optimal management of the diabetic 
athlete.
