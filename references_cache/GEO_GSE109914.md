# Genome wide DNA methylation analysis of arsenic exposure and non-exposure population and patients with skin lesions

## Content

Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of arsenic exposure and non-exposure population and patients with skin leisons. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450K) was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in genomic DNA extracted from blood buffy coat samples. Samples included 66 arsenic exposure individuals, 35 non-exposure individuals and 18 arsenical skin lesion patients.
