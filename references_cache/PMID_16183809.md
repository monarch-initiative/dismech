Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is an autosomal dominant heart-hand syndrome 
characterized by congenital heart disease (CHD) and upper limb deformity, and 
caused by mutations in the TBX5 gene. To date, the sensitivity of TBX5 genetic 
testing for HOS has been unclear. We now report mutational analyses of a 
nongenetically selected population of 54 unrelated individuals who were 
consecutively referred to our center with a clinical diagnosis of HOS. TBX5 
mutational analyses were performed in all individuals, and clinical histories 
and findings were reviewed for each patient without reference to the genotypes. 
Twenty-six percent of the complete cohort was shown to have mutations of the 
TBX5 gene. However, among those subjects for whom clinical review demonstrated 
that their presentations met strict diagnostic criteria for HOS, TBX5 mutations 
were identified in 74%. No mutations were identified in those subjects who did 
not meet these criteria. Thus, these studies validate our clinical diagnostic 
criteria for HOS including an absolute requirement for preaxial radial ray upper 
limb malformation. Accordingly, TBX5 genotyping has high sensitivity and 
specificity for HOS if stringent diagnostic criteria are used in assigning the 
clinical diagnosis.
