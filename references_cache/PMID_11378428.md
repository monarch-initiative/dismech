Cholera, an infectious disease caused by Vibrio cholerae, is primarily 
transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food or water. In severe cases, cholera 
may lead to severe dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and ultimately, hypovolemic 
shock and death. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of V. cholerae in 
a stool specimen. Treatment should be started immediately by rapid replacement 
of fluid and electrolytes. Antibiotics such as tetracycline and doxycycline 
shorten the duration of illness but do not significantly affect overall 
mortality. Cholera can be prevented by limiting spread, survival, and growth of 
the organism. The current parenteral cholera vaccine is not recommended by the 
Public Health Service or the World Health Organization because of its limited 
protection. A number of oral vaccines are currently being tested in clinical 
trials.
