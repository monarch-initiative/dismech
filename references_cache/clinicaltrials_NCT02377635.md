# Selenium and Arsenic Pharmacodynamics

## Content

This clinical trial should prove that selenium can treat arsenic exposure in humans by promoting excretion. The new trial differs from previous trials in that participants will be maintained in a local clinic and provided with food and water from their home villages. The purpose of this study to determine the fate of selenium supplements in feces, urine and blood of volunteers living in conditions of high arsenic load in drinking water. The use of a clinic will enable monitoring of all intake and excretion of both arsenic and selenium, and will ensure that participants take their selenium doses or placebo as appropriate. This proof of concept is absolutely essential groundwork for any remediation strategy involving selenium supplements.
