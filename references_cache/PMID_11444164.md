This article reviews the technical aspects and clinical applications of the 
radioactive iodine uptake test and thyroid scintiscanning. The choice of 
radionuclide for the tests is discussed. The main uses of the radioactive iodine 
uptake test are to identify the cause of hyperthyroidism and to aid in the 
selection of the I-131 dose in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Factors other 
than thyroid diseases that alter uptake results are identified. Thyroid 
scintiscanning is used in the identification of normal and ectopic thyroid 
tissue, in the diagnosis of the cause of a patient's hyperthyroidism, and as 
part of the evaluation of selected patients with thyroid nodules.
