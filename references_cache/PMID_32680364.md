Editorial Conflicts of Interest (February 2016).

[No authors listed]

Editors have been asked to disclose their financial interests or other 
relationships that could be viewed as potential conflicts of interest (COI) as 
they might relate to editorial judgements. The COI period covered extends to the 
36-month period prior to 31 January 2016, and declarations are in accordance 
with recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journals Editors 
(ICMJE). Editorial practice is for Editors to recuse themselves from any 
decisions in which a conflict of interest exists or could be perceived to exist. 
Statements are provided both for decision editors of the journal and editorial 
staff.
