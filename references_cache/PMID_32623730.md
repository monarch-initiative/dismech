BACKGROUND: Aromatase deficiency (AD) caused by cytochrome P450 family 19 
subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP19A1) variants is characterized by a deficiency in 
androgen-to-oestrogen conversion.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics and accurate management 
of aromatase-deficient children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We described three 46, XX aromatase-deficient children, 
searched PubMed with "(aromatase deficiency) AND (46, XX OR ovaries)" and 
manually searched citations in identified studies for the literature review.
RESULTS: Two girls and one boy (3.4-9.2 years) with the 46, XX karyotype 
presented ambiguous genitalia and maternal antenatal virilization, normal-low 
height, delayed bone age, normal glucose and lipid profiles, markedly elevated 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and poor oestradiol responses to human 
menopausal gonadotropin stimulation. Ultrasound revealed normal-sized uterus and 
ovaries with undetectable follicles. Histopathology revealed primordial 
follicles and few primary follicles in ovaries. One patient presented granulosa 
and follicular membrane cell proliferation and interstitial sclerosis. We 
identified four CYP19A1 variants; c.146_158del and c.344G >A were unreported. We 
reviewed available data from thirty 46, XX patients (0.2-32 years). Some 
patients were not diagnosed until puberty/adulthood; three were initially 
misdiagnosed with congenital adrenocortical hyperplasia. The main 
characteristics were maternal antenatal virilization (21/29), ambiguous 
genitalia (mainly Prader IV or III, 19/23), delayed bone age (16/17), low bone 
mass (5/8), markedly elevated FSH levels and ovarian cysts (13/30).
CONCLUSIONS: 46, XX AD is easily neglected or misdiagnosed. Ambiguous genitalia, 
maternal antenatal virilization and markedly elevated FSH levels are important 
diagnostic indicators. We described two novel variants, new histopathological 
features of ovaries and an early management strategy.
