# The Natural History of Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (CA-MRSA) Infections and an Evaluation of Decolonization Strategies

## Content

The purpose of this study is to determine the natural history of community-associated Staphylococcus aureus infections in both adult and pediatric patients by monitoring the rate of recurrent infections in those colonized with S. aureus.

In addition, this study will evaluate the efficiency of commonly prescribed decolonization measures in patients presenting with S. aureus skin and soft tissue infections.
