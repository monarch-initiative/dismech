OBJECTIVES: To track the prevalence trends of latent tuberculosis infection 
(LTBI) at the global, regional, and national levels.
METHODS: Data on the prevalence of LTBI were extracted from the Global Burden of 
Disease database. The average annual percent change (AAPC) was estimated by 
joinpoint regression and was used to evaluate the epidemic of the disease.
RESULTS: Globally, the prevalence rate of LTBI decreased from 30.66% in 1990 to 
23.67% in 2019, with an AAPC of -0.9%. The prevalence rate of LTBI varied from 
5.02% (Jordan) to 48.35% (Uganda) in 1990 and from 2.51% (Jordan) to 43.75% 
(Vietnam) in 2019 at the country level. The prevalence decreased in all the six 
World Health Organization (WHO) regions and in most countries, with the AAPC 
ranging from -0.5% in the Western Pacific Region to -2.1% in the European Region 
and from -4.3% (Bhutan) to -0.1% (Malaysia, Myanmar, South Africa, Tokelau, and 
Vietnam), respectively. Disparities were also observed among different sex and 
age groups.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of LTBI decreased slightly worldwide in the last 
three decades, but the decrease is slow and not sufficient to meet the targets 
of WHO tuberculosis elimination. Much more effort and progress should be made in 
order to decrease the prevalence of LTBI.
