Language disorders of degenerative origin are frequently tied to Alzheimer 
disease (AD) the different variants of which can result in primary and secondary 
aphasia syndromes. More specifically, Alzheimer pathology can primarily erode 
frontal, temporal or parietal language cortices resulting in three genuine AD 
language variants which account for about 30% of primary degenerative aphasias. 
Likewise, it can spread from non-language to language cortices leading to 
secondary language disorders like in typical amnesic AD and in several atypical 
AD variants. This paper reviews the whole set of AD variants by characterising 
their impact on the neural language system and on linguistic functioning. It 
also provides cues for diagnostic strategies which are essential for linguistic, 
syndromic and nosological patient classification, for adequate clinical 
follow-up and for guiding language rehabilitation. Such diagnostic approaches, 
founded on detailed linguistic phenotyping while integrating anatomical and 
neuropathological findings, also represent a crucial issue for future drug 
trials targeting the physio-pathological processes in degenerative aphasias.
