Adult-onset mixed myopathy with nemaline rods, minicores, and central cores: a 
muscle disorder mimicking polymyositis.

Seitz RJ, Toyka KV, Wechsler W.

A woman, aged 75 years, presented with a 15-year history of progressive, 
generalized, painful muscle weakness and wasting. Clinical and laboratory 
investigation revealed a sporadic muscle disorder. Muscle biopsy showed a mixed 
pattern of nemaline myopathy with minicores and central cores and severe atrophy 
of type-1 and type-2 fibers. A trial of immunosuppressive treatment did not 
improve her condition, which clinically mimicked chronic progressive 
polymyositis. Mixed myofibrillar myopathies of this type have so far only been 
described among the group of congenital myopathies.
