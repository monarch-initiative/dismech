Knowledge of the biological events involved in colorectal tumor formation is 
progressing rapidly. Molecular studies support the clinical impression that 
adenocarcinoma of the large intestine develops in stages. At the center of the 
pathological continuum between normal mucosa and invasive carcinoma is the 
premalignant lesion, the adenomatous polyp. We review the epidemiological, 
morphological, biochemical, and genetic evidence implicating adenomas as 
precursors of colorectal carcinoma. The molecular changes most highly implicated 
in neoplastic initiation and progression are reviewed in detail. Current 
strategies of chemoprevention are summarized, and future prospects for clinical 
intervention are outlined.
