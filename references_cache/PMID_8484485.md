In this syndrome there is a disproportionate dwarfism with kyphoscoliosis, 
stiffness of the joints, minor facial dysmorphia, myopia and both conductive and 
sensorineural deafness in 50 percent of patients. It is a dominant autosomic 
heritable malady of unknown incidence, but both sexes seems equally affected. 
The patient's condition is diagnosed at birth, because of the short limbs and 
the enlargement of the joints. In the presented case, diagnosed at birth, the 
deafness was suppose to be transmissive, owing to the coexistence of a cleft 
palate, and consequently a grommet was inserted in the tympanum. Only 
afterwards, when the girl was 12 years old, the cochlear component of the 
hypoacusis fell in consideration.
