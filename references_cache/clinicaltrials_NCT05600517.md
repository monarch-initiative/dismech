# Evaluation of Caries Prevention Based on Genetic Etiology and Risk: Protocol for a Multicenter Randomized Controlled and Adaptive Trial for Oral Personalized Care (PRECARIES)

## Content

Dental caries affects billions of people worldwide and involves saliva immunodeficiency, commensal pathogen and exposure (lifestyle) causal subtypes of the disease. Up to 85% of adolescents in Swedish and other low prevalence populations are caries-free while the remaining 15% show high, recurrent caries activity. Accordingly, there is a lack of cost-effective risk assessment and prevention tools for personalized oral care. This randomized adaptive clinical trial (RCT) evaluates both caries prevention based on genetic etiology and risk, as a consequence of saliva immunodeficiency genes specifying individuals as susceptible or resistant to caries, and the effect of intensified versus selfcare traditional prevention on the two groups.
