OBJECTIVE: A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 33 (ADAM33) gene has been 
considered as an asthma susceptibility gene due to its possible role in airway 
remodeling, abnormal cell proliferation, and differentiation. Association of 
this gene with asthma has been reported in several genetic studies on various 
populations. The current study aims to evaluate the association of ADAM33 gene 
polymorphisms with the risk of asthma in the Punjabi population of Pakistan.
METHOD: A total of 101 asthma patients and 102 age-matched healthy controls from 
Lahore, a city in Punjab, were recruited. ADAM33 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) T + 1[rs2280089], T2[rs2280090], T1[rs2280091], ST + 5[rs597980], 
ST + 4[rs44707], S2[rs528557], Q - 1[rs612709], and F + 1[rs511898] were 
genotyped in both patients and controls using single base extension and 
capillary electrophoresis-based genetic analyzer. The basic allelic and 
genotypic model was analyzed for association of the SNPs with asthma using 
SHEsis software. Haploview software was used to calculate pairwise linkage 
disequilibrium (LD) among six of the genotyped SNPs.
RESULTS: Of the 8 SNPs genotyped, only S2[rs528557] showed significant 
association with asthma (Allele p = 0.0189, Genotype p = 0.021). SNPs 
T + 1[rs2280089], T2[rs2280090], T1[rs2280091], ST + 4[rs44707], S2[rs528557], 
and Q - 1[rs612709] were found to be in moderate to strong LD. The significantly 
higher frequency of haplotype "AAGTCG" in healthy controls suggests a protective 
effect against asthma risk in the studied population (p = 0.0059).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that genetic variants of ADAM33 gene may play 
important roles in asthma susceptibility in the Punjabi population of Pakistan.
