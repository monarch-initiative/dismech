Morgagni-Stewart-Morel (MSM) syndrome is characterized by the thickening of the 
frontal bone of the skull (hyperostosis frontalis interna) obesity, neurological 
symptoms, and hypertrichosis. We present the case of a 76-year-old patient who 
complained of confusion, extreme irritability, and headache and was diagnosed 
with MSM based on examination, imaging, and test results.
