Non-segmental vitiligo (NSV) is the most common type of vitiligo, which is 
characterized by chronic and progressive loss of melanocytes. Genetic factors 
have been shown to play a key role in NSV in association and family studies. 
Granzyme B is a serine protease found in the cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes and natural killer cells that play an important role in inducing 
apoptotic changes of target cells. Several recent studies have provided evidence 
that polymorphism in the GZMB gene might be associated with autoimmune disease. 
A total of 249 NSV patients and 455 healthy controls were recruited to determine 
whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [rs2236337 (3' untranslated 
region, UTR), rs2236338 (Tyr247His), rs11539752 (Pro94Ala), rs10909625 
(Lys80Lys), rs8192917 (Arg55Gln), and rs7144366 (5' near gene)] in GZMB gene 
contribute to the risk of developing NSV. Genotyping was performed using a 
single 192.24 Dynamic Array IFC. Data were analyzed using EP1 SNP Genotyping 
Analysis software to obtain genotype calls. Among the six SNPs tested, five SNPs 
(rs2236337, rs2236338, rs11539752, rs10909625, and rs8192917) showed significant 
association with NSV susceptibility. Among them, rs2236338, rs11539752, 
rs10909625, and rs8192917 remained a statistically significant association 
following multiple correction test. The five SNPs were located within a block of 
linkage disequilibrium. Haplotypes T-A-G-T-T and C-G-C-C-C consisting of 
rs2236337, rs2236338, rs11539752, rs10909625, and rs8192917 demonstrated 
significant association with NSV. Our results suggest that GZMB polymorphisms 
are associated with the development of NSV.
