Abstract

Purpose of Review
We review pathophysiology and clinical features of mitochondrial disorders manifesting with cardiomyopathy.

Recent Findings
Mechanistic studies have shed light into the underpinnings of mitochondrial disorders, providing novel insights into mitochondrial physiology and identifying new therapeutic targets.

Summary
Mitochondrial disorders are a group of rare genetic diseases that are caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or in nuclear genes that are essential to mitochondrial function. The clinical picture is extremely heterogeneous, the onset can occur at any age, and virtually, any organ or tissue can be involved. Since the heart relies primarily on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to fuel contraction and relaxation, cardiac involvement is common in mitochondrial disorders and often represents a major determinant of their prognosis.
