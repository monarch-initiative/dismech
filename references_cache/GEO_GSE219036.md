# Virological characterization of the 2022 outbreak-causing monkeypox virus using human keratinocytes and colon organoids

## Content

The outbreak-causing monkeypox virus of 2022 (2022 MPXV) is classified as a clade IIb strain and phylogenetically distinct from prior endemic MPXV strains (clades I or IIa), suggesting that its virological properties may also differ. Here, we used human keratinocytes and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived colon organoids to examine the efficiency of viral growth in these cells and the MPXV infection-mediated host responses. MPXV replication was much more productive in keratinocytes than in colon organoids. We observed that MPXV infections, regardless of strain, caused cellular dysfunction and mitochondrial damage in keratinocytes. Notably, a significant increase in the expression of hypoxia-related genes was observed specifically in 2022 MPXV-infected keratinocytes. Our comparison of virological features between 2022 MPXV and prior endemic MPXV strains revealed signaling pathways potentially involved with the cellular damages caused by MPXV infections and highlights host vulnerabilities that could be utilized as protective therapeutic strategies against human mpox in the future.
