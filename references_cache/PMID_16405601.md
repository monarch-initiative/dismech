A limited number of studies have paid attention to the psychosocial well-being 
of patients affected with vitiligo. We review the psychosocial effects of 
vitiligo, how patients deal with them and the psychiatric morbidity in vitiligo 
patients. Given the appreciable comorbidity, it is important to consider these 
observations in the management of patients, for example in patient-physician 
interaction but also in treatment strategies and evaluation of treatments. The 
effects of the psychological state on the disease itself together with the 
potential therapeutic implications are reviewed. Based on these data, we suggest 
how to further improve patient's management.
