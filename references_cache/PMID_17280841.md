Innate immunity relies on signalling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to alert the 
immune system of the presence of invading bacteria. TLR activation leads to the 
release of cytokines that allow for effective innate and adaptive immune 
responses. However, the contribution of different TLRs depends on the site of 
the infection and the pathogen. This review will describe the involvement of 
TLRs in the development of three different bacterial infections as well as our 
current understanding of the role of TLRs during microbial pathogenesis.
