Heavy metal toxicity is often caused by occupational exposure. Chronic cadmium 
toxicity is a significant health concern among workers engaged in zinc smelting, 
battery production and silver jewellery industries, particularly in developing 
countries. We report the case of a 48-year-old man who presented with severe 
osteoporosis, impaired renal function and acquired Fanconi syndrome. He was 
finally diagnosed with chronic cadmium toxicity resulting from long-term 
occupational exposure. Cadmium has a long biological half-life and there is no 
effective treatment for people who are exposed to it. Therefore, an early 
diagnosis and prevention of further exposure are important.
