Venoms are primarily believed to evolve under strong diversifying selection 
resulting from persistent coevolution between predator and prey. Recent research 
has challenged this hypothesis, proposing that venoms from younger venomous 
lineages (e.g., snakes and cone snails) are governed predominantly by 
diversifying selection, while venoms from older venomous lineages (e.g., 
centipedes, scorpions, and spiders) are under stronger purifying selection. 
However, most research in older lineages has tested selection at more diverse 
phylogenetic scales. Although these tests are important for evaluating broad 
macroevolutionary trends underlying venom evolution, they are less equipped to 
detect species-level evolutionary trends, which likely have large impacts on 
venom variation seen at more diverse phylogenetic scales. To test for selection 
among closely related species from an older venomous lineage, we generated 
high-throughput venom-gland transcriptomes and venom proteomes for four 
populations of Giant Desert Hairy Scorpions (Hadrurus), including three Hadrurus 
arizonensis populations and one Hadrurus spadix population. We detected 
significant episodic and pervasive diversifying selection across a highly 
abundant toxin family that likely has a major role in venom function ([Formula: 
see text]KTxs), providing a contrast to the stronger purifying selection 
identified from other studies on scorpion venoms. Conversely, we detected weak 
episodic diversifying and/or stronger purifying selection in four toxin families 
(non-disulfide bridged peptides, phospholipase A2s, scorpine-like antimicrobial 
peptides, and serine proteases), most of which were less abundant and likely 
have ancillary functional roles. Finally, although we detected several major 
toxin families at disproportionate transcriptomic and/or proteomic abundances, 
we did not identify significant sex-based variation in Hadrurus venoms.
