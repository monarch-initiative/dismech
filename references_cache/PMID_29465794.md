Dengue fever is the commonest viral haemorrhagic fever worldwide and is a 
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropics. Dengue viral infections 
are frequently associated with varying degrees of liver injury. Liver injury is 
more severe in dengue haemorrhagic fever or severe dengue. We review the current 
knowledge on liver involvement following dengue viral infections and explore the 
links between clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and their impact on 
management.
