Waterborne diseases affect millions of people annually, challenging public 
health worldwide. Despite the advancements in water management, high-income 
countries remain at risk, mainly because of faulty or ageing water 
infrastructure. Giardia and Campylobacter are two key waterborne pathogens and 
leading agents of gastrointestinal illnesses. Both can be transmitted through 
contaminated water under similar environmental and sanitary conditions, with 
co-infections worsening symptoms and complicating diagnosis and treatment 
efficacy. This review examines waterborne outbreaks in Europe, over the last 
15 years (2010-2024), focusing on Giardia while adding an additional perspective 
on Campylobacter. Over 30 outbreaks were reported during the study period, 
primarily in Ireland and Nordic countries. Recreational and drinking water 
sources were the most commonly implicated, with contamination events often 
associated with specific incidents or treatment failures, and heavy rainfall 
suggested as contributing factor to pathogen entry. In addition, climate change 
is discussed as a major driver exacerbating waterborne disease risks through 
extreme weather events. The review highlights persistent vulnerabilities in 
water safety across Europe, and emphasizes the importance of mitigation 
strategies, which include risk assessment, early detection and continuous 
surveillance, improved water treatment and climate-resilient infrastructures, 
along with interdisciplinary collaboration with different stakeholders.
