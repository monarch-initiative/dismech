A successful pregnancy requires multiple adaptations of the mother's physiology 
to optimize fetal growth and development, to protect the fetus from adverse 
programming, to provide impetus for timely parturition and to ensure that 
adequate maternal care is provided after parturition. Many of these adaptations 
are organized by the mother's brain, predominantly through changes in 
neuroendocrine systems, and these changes are primarily driven by the hormones 
of pregnancy. By contrast, adaptations in the mother's brain during lactation 
are maintained by external stimuli from the young. The changes in pregnancy are 
not necessarily innocuous: they may predispose the mother to post-partum mood 
disorders.
