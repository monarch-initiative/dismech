INTRODUCTION: Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
caused by mutations in the SPINK5 gene, which encodes the serine protease 
inhibitor LEKTI. It is characterized by congenital ichthyosis, hair shaft 
abnormalities, and atopic manifestations. Previous reports suggest that 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may provide partial clinical benefit in NS. 
Here, we report the clinical and immunological characterization of an infant 
with NS effectively treated with IVIG therapy.
METHODS: Clinical information was collected and reviewed from a 
1-year-6-month-old boy presenting with NS. Hair shaft abnormalities were 
examined by scanning electron microscopy. Pathogenic variants in SPINK5 were 
identified using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing. Protein expression was 
assessed by Western blotting and ELISA. Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were 
analyzed by flow cytometry, and cytokine levels were evaluated with the Olink® 
Target 48 Cytokine panel.
RESULTS: The patient presented with typical clinical manifestations of NS. 
Genetic analysis identified a novel heterozygous deletion spanning the SPINK5 
gene (chr5:147,443,561-147,719,327), together with the c.1258A>G (p.K420E) 
polymorphism. LEKTI expression was markedly decreased, consistent with the 
genetic findings. Immune profiling revealed markedly reduced unswitched memory 
and marginal zone-like B cells, increased naïve B cells, and elevated γδ T cells 
compared with healthy controls. Cytokine analysis showed significantly increased 
levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TGFA, IL17 family 
members, CXCL8, CCL2, TNF, CCL19, and IL18. Following IVIG therapy, the patient 
demonstrated significant clinical improvement, with recovery of skin 
manifestations, and partial normalization of lymphocyte subsets and cytokine 
levels, indicating restoration of immune regulation.
DISCUSSION: This study reports a novel compound heterozygous SPINK5 mutation in 
an infant with NS, comprising a large deletion and c.1258A>G polymorphism, 
resulting in LEKTI deficiency and immune dysregulation. IVIG therapy effectively 
alleviated clinical symptoms and restored immune balance, highlighting its 
potential as a therapeutic option for NS and related immunodeficiency disorders.
