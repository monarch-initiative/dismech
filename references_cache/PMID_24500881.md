The positions of double bonds in lipids play critical roles in their biochemical 
and biophysical properties. In this study, by coupling Paternò-Büchi (P-B) 
reaction with tandem mass spectrometry, we developed a novel method that can 
achieve confident, fast, and sensitive determination of double bond locations 
within various types of lipids. The P-B reaction is facilitated by UV 
irradiation of a nanoelectrospray plume entraining lipids and acetone. Tandem 
mass spectrometry of the on-line reaction products via collision activation 
leads to the rupture of oxetane rings and the formation of diagnostic ions 
specific to the double bond location.
