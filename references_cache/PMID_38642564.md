Portal hypertension represents the primary non-neoplastic complication of liver 
cirrhosis and has life-threatening consequences, such as oesophageal variceal 
bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension occurs due to 
increased resistance of the cirrhotic liver vasculature to portal blood flow and 
is further aggravated by the hyperdynamic circulatory syndrome. Existing 
knowledge indicates that the profibrogenic phenotype acquired by sinusoidal 
cells is the initial factor leading to increased hepatic vascular tone and 
fibrosis, which cause increased vascular resistance and portal hypertension. 
Data also suggest that the phenotype of hepatic cells could be further impaired 
due to the altered mechanical properties of the cirrhotic liver itself, creating 
a deleterious cycle that worsens portal hypertension in the advanced stages of 
liver disease. In this Review, we discuss recent discoveries in the 
pathophysiology and treatment of cirrhotic portal hypertension, a condition with 
few pharmacological treatment options.
