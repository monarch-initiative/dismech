## Content

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting in motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability, as well as a wide variety of non-motor manifestations. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are essential nutrients involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, energy metabolism, and cellular signaling. Emerging evidence suggests that BCAA metabolism is intricately linked to the pathophysiology of PD. Dysregulation of BCAA levels has been associated with energy metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and altered neurotransmission. Furthermore, the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK), a key regulator of BCAA catabolism, has been implicated in PD through its role in modulating neuronal energetics and redox homeostasis. In this review, we synthesize current molecular, genetic, microbiome, and clinical evidence on BCAA dysregulation in PD to provide an integrative perspective on the BCAA–PD axis and highlight directions for future translational research. We explored the dualistic role of BCAAs as both potential neuroprotective agents and metabolic stressors, and critically examined the therapeutic prospects and limitations of BCAA supplementation and BCKDK targeting.
