Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with many pathological and functional 
abnormalities affecting all organ systems. Renal manifestations of SCD may 
result in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which can be treated by chronic 
haemodialysis or renal transplantation. Renal transplantation was successfully 
performed in a 25-yr-old male with sickle cell beta-thalassaemia and nephrotic 
syndrome. We present a case report of this patient, a discussion of the renal 
complications associated with SCD and the perioperative management of a patient 
with SCD undergoing renal transplantation.
