OBJECTIVE: To assess alterations in brain metabolites in patients with 
late-onset ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD).
METHODS: Six unrelated, asymptomatic Japanese late-onset OTCD patients were 
analyzed by proton MRS ((1)HMRS) using a point-resolved spectroscopy technique 
(repetition and echo times, 5000 and 30 ms). Localized spectra for the centrum 
semiovale were acquired and absolute metabolite concentrations were calculated 
using an LCModel.
RESULTS: Compared with age-matched controls, N-acetylaspartate and creatine 
concentrations were normal in all patients. The glutamine (Gln) plus glutamate 
concentration was increased in four patients, which progressed in proportion to 
the clinical stage. myo-inositol (mI) could not be detected in five symptomatic 
patients. A decreased choline (Cho) concentration was detected in two clinically 
severe patients. (1)HMRS after liver transplantation in one patient revealed the 
normalization of all metabolites.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest progression of neurochemical events in OTCD, 
i.e., mI depletion and Gln accumulation followed by Cho depletion, which is 
reverse of that in hepatic encephalopathy, i.e., Cho depletion followed by mI 
depletion and Gln accumulation.
