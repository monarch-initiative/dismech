SPG23 is an autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative subtype of lower limb spastic 
paraparesis with additional diffuse skin and hair dyspigmentation at birth 
followed by further patchy pigment loss during childhood. Previously, 
genome-wide linkage in an Arab-Israeli pedigree mapped the gene to an 
approximately 25 cM locus on chromosome 1q24-q32. By using whole-exome 
sequencing in a further Palestinian-Jordanian SPG23 pedigree, we identified a 
complex homozygous 4-kb deletion/20-bp insertion in DSTYK (dual serine-threonine 
and tyrosine protein kinase) in all four affected family members. DSTYK is 
located within the established linkage region and we also found the same 
mutation in the previously reported pedigree and another Israeli pedigree (total 
of ten affected individuals from three different families). The mutation removes 
the last two exons and part of the 3' UTR of DSTYK. Skin biopsies revealed 
reduced DSTYK protein levels along with focal loss of melanocytes. 
Ultrastructurally, swollen mitochondria and cytoplasmic vacuoles were also noted 
in remaining melanocytes and some keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Cultured 
keratinocytes and fibroblasts from an affected individual, as well as knockdown 
of Dstyk in mouse melanocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts, were associated 
with increased cell death after ultraviolet irradiation. Keratinocytes from an 
affected individual showed loss of kinase activity upon stimulation with 
fibroblast growth factor. Previously, dominant mutations in DSTYK were 
implicated in congenital urological developmental disorders, but our study 
identifies different phenotypic consequences for a recurrent autosomal-recessive 
deletion mutation in revealing the genetic basis of SPG23.
