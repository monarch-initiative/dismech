## Content

AbstractNetherton syndrome (NS) is a rare skin disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 5 (SPINK5) gene. Disease severity and the lack of efficacious treatments call for a better understanding of NS mechanisms. Here we describe a novel and viable, Spink5 conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse model, allowing to study NS progression. By combining transcriptomics and proteomics, we determine a disease molecular profile common to mouse models and NS patients. Spink5 cKO mice and NS patients share skin barrier and inflammation signatures defined by up-regulation and increased activity of proteases, IL-17, IL-36, and IL-20 family cytokine signaling. Systemic inflammation in Spink5 cKO mice correlates with disease severity and is associated with thymic atrophy and enlargement of lymph nodes and spleen. This systemic inflammation phenotype is marked by neutrophils and IL-17/IL-22 signaling, does not involve primary T cell immunodeficiency and is independent of bacterial infection. By comparing skin transcriptomes and proteomes, we uncover several putative substrates of tissue kallikrein-related proteases (KLKs), demonstrating that KLKs can proteolytically regulate IL-36 pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our study thus provides a conserved molecular framework for NS and reveals a KLK/IL-36 signaling axis, adding new insights into the disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.
