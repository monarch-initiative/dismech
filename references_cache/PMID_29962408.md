Hereditary transthyretin (TTR)-related amyloidosis is caused by mutations in the 
TTR gene. The mutations destabilize the tetramer and/or monomer of TTR, and thus 
the stabilization of TTR is a key strategy for the treatment of TTR-related 
amyloidosis. In this review, we summarized the natural products and synthetic 
compounds that have been shown to inhibit the amyloidogenesis of TTR. The 
stabilizers and/or the amyloid fibril disrupters isolated from natural sources 
may become lead compounds for the treatment of TTR-related amyloidosis.
