Bacterial meningitis--1982.

Gold R.

The etiologic agents in bacterial meningitis vary with time, geography, and 
patient age. Predominant pathogens are Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, 
Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and 
Streptococcus pneumoniae. Approximately 70 percent of all cases occur in 
children under the age of five. The case-fatality rate in the United States in 
1978 was 13.6 percent, but it is known that underreporting of cases, and 
therefore of case-fatalities, occurs. Prevention by vaccine appears to be the 
ultimate solution, but until a vaccine is developed emphasis should be on rapid 
diagnosis, improved management, and proper choice of antibiotic.
