Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is the third leading cause of death in United 
States and hypertension is a leading cause of both stroke and heart disease. It 
may cause headache, acute hypertensive encephalopathy, dementia and various 
types of strokes e.g., thrombotic, haemorrhagic, lacunar infarcts and transient 
ischaemic attacks. It remains the singlemost important treatable risk factor for 
stroke in all age groups and modern antihypertensive therapy has its documented 
prevention of stroke. Hypertension in acute phase of ischaemic stroke should not 
be treated. Hypertension in acute stroke should be treated. In advanced centres 
with specialised stroke units, the favoured drugs are short acting vasodilators 
e.g., sodium nitroprusside and labetalol. Nifedipine is the most popular drug 
followed by captopril, both sublingually and orally.
