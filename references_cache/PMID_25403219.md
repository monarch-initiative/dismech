PURPOSE: Heterozygous germline PTCH1 mutations are causative of Gorlin syndrome 
(naevoid basal cell carcinoma), but detection rates > 70% have rarely been 
reported. We aimed to define the causative mutations in individuals with Gorlin 
syndrome without PTCH1 mutations.
METHODS: We undertook exome sequencing on lymphocyte DNA from four unrelated 
individuals from families with Gorlin syndrome with no PTCH1 mutations found by 
Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), or 
RNA analysis.
RESULTS: A germline heterozygous nonsense mutation in SUFU was identified in one 
of four exomes. Sanger sequencing of SUFU in 23 additional PTCH1-negative Gorlin 
syndrome families identified a SUFU mutation in a second family. Copy-number 
analysis of SUFU by MLPA revealed a large heterozygous deletion in a third 
family. All three SUFU-positive families fulfilled diagnostic criteria for 
Gorlin syndrome, although none had odontogenic jaw keratocysts. Each 
SUFU-positive family included a single case of medulloblastoma, whereas only two 
(1.7%) of 115 individuals with Gorlin syndrome and a PTCH1 mutation developed 
medulloblastoma.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate convincing evidence that SUFU mutations can cause 
classical Gorlin syndrome. Our study redefines the risk of medulloblastoma in 
Gorlin syndrome, dependent on the underlying causative gene. Previous reports 
have found a 5% risk of medulloblastoma in Gorlin syndrome. We found a < 2% risk 
in PTCH1 mutation-positive individuals, with a risk up to 20× higher in SUFU 
mutation-positive individuals. Our data suggest childhood brain magnetic 
resonance imaging surveillance is justified in SUFU-related, but not 
PTCH1-related, Gorlin syndrome.
