The middle ear cavity and the eustachian tube contain a well-functioning 
mucociliary clearance system. To learn more about the importance of this 
mucociliary clearance, we studied patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, in 
whom mucociliary clearance is absent. Thirty-six patients were investigated by 
means of a questionnaire; in 16 of these patients, otological and audiological 
studies could be performed. In patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a 
discrepancy was found between subjective ear complaints and the actual middle 
ear function. Moreover, it appeared that for the middle ear system, mucociliary 
clearance is of importance only in the first 3 decades of life. With aging, 
however, a deficient mucociliary clearance system in the middle ear and 
eustachian tube can be fully compensated for.
