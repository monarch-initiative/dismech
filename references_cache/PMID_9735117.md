The entry of one HIV virion into a human being has the potential to cause death 
by the inexorable replication of the virus within the principal T lymphocyte, 
the CD4+ T cell. Although combination antiretroviral therapy, particularly 
therapy with protease inhibitors, decreases the viral burden to very low, even 
undetectable, levels, sequestration of the virus in privileged sites, including 
a long-lived CD4+ T cell, has frustrated efforts at eradication of HIV. 
Activation of the immune system, therefore, appears essential before this 
infection can be conquered. Powerful vaccines capable of preventing infection 
remain the hope of the world.
