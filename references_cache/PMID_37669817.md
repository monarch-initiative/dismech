Ludwig's angina (LA) is a rapidly progressing cellulitis that develops after 
oral infections or molar extractions, typically causing fever and chills and 
rarely progressing to trismus and cyanosis. It is associated with risk factors 
including diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol use, oral malignancy, poor dentition 
or an immunocompromised state. This case report reviews a previously healthy 
patient with no appreciable risk factors presenting with LA following a third 
molar extraction, complicated by extensive anterior deep neck space abscesses, 
cavernous venous thrombosis and Lemierre's Syndrome. Our case demonstrates the 
importance of early intervention when suspecting LA to prevent life-threatening 
complications and death.
