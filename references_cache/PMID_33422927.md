Background-objectives: Liver transplantation (LT) and combined liver and kidney 
transplantation (CLKT) have been proposed as enzyme replacement therapies for 
methylmalonic aciduria (MMA). We aimed to synthesize the available evidence on 
their safety and efficacy.
METHODS: Medline, Embase and Cochrane library were searched to identify studies 
that reported post-LT/CLKT clinical outcomes of MMA from their inception to 
February 1, 2020. The pooled rate was calculated using random-effects model with 
Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation method.
RESULTS: Thirty-two studies involving 109 patients were included. The pooled 
estimate rates were 99.9% (95% CI 95.3-100.0) for patient survival, 98.5% (95% 
CI 91.5-100.0) for graft survival after LT/CLKT. The combined incidence of 
biliary, vascular complications and rejection were 0.2% (95% CI 0.0-6.6), 7.7% 
(95% CI 0.1-22.1) and 18.4% (95% CI 4.6-36.3), respectively. The pooled estimate 
rates were 100.0% (95% CI 99.4-100.0) for metabolic eradication, 61.5% (95% CI: 
33.4-87.0) for normalization of kidney function. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
remission is more promising after CLKT (70.3% VS 37.6% in LT group). The pooled 
estimate rates for neurodevelopmental status improvement and protein intake 
liberalization were 52.0% (95% CI 2.8-98.8) and 36.3% (95% CI 6.3-71.7), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This first quantitative systematic review confirms favorable 
survival outcomes and partially improved disease-related complications in 
transplanted MMA patients, although some results should be interpreted with 
caution. Future studies with detailed description of long-term outcomes and 
consensus on neurodevelopmental evaluation method can help provide a more 
accurate picture.
