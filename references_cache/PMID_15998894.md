CONTEXT: Sickle cell disease is characterized by a state of nitric oxide 
resistance and limited bioavailability of l-arginine, the substrate for nitric 
oxide synthesis. We hypothesized that increased arginase activity and 
dysregulated arginine metabolism contribute to endothelial dysfunction, 
pulmonary hypertension, and patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of arginase in sickle cell disease pathogenesis, 
pulmonary hypertension, and mortality.
DESIGN: Plasma amino acid levels, plasma and erythrocyte arginase activities, 
and pulmonary hypertension status as measured by Doppler echocardiogram were 
prospectively obtained in outpatients with sickle cell disease. Patients were 
followed up for survival up to 49 months.
SETTING: Urban tertiary care center and community clinics in the United States 
between February 2001 and March 2005.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients with sickle cell disease, aged 
18 to 74 years, and 36 control participants.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma amino acid levels, plasma and erythrocyte arginase 
activities, diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, and mortality.
RESULTS: Plasma arginase activity was significantly elevated in patients with 
sickle cell disease, with highest activity found in patients with secondary 
pulmonary hypertension. Arginase activity correlated with the arginine-ornithine 
ratio, and lower ratios were associated with greater severity of pulmonary 
hypertension and with mortality in this population (risk ratio, 2.5; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.2; P = .006). Global arginine bioavailability, 
characterized by the ratio of arginine to ornithine plus citrulline, was also 
strongly associated with mortality (risk ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.3; P<.001). 
Increased plasma arginase activity was correlated with increased intravascular 
hemolytic rate and, to a lesser extent, with markers of inflammation and soluble 
adhesion molecule levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support a novel mechanism of disease in which hemolysis 
contributes to reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction 
via release of erythrocyte arginase, which limits arginine bioavailability, and 
release of erythrocyte hemoglobin, which scavenges nitric oxide. The ratios of 
arginine to ornithine and arginine to ornithine plus citrulline are 
independently associated with pulmonary hypertension and increased mortality in 
patients with sickle cell disease.
