Aortic dissection is the most common catastrophic condition affecting the aorta. 
Its clinical presentation is variable and can mimic any number of medical and 
surgical conditions. The most prevalent symptom is excruciating chest pain. 
Essential treatment includes rapid initiation of pharmacologic agents to control 
hypertension. Aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta also necessitates 
immediate surgical repair. Surgical treatment of aortic dissection involving 
only the descending aorta generally is reserved for patients with persistent 
pain, intractable hypertension, or evidence of propagation of the dissection. 
Nursing management includes blood pressure monitoring, serial physical 
assessment, and postoperative care, as appropriate.
