Variants in potassium channel-related genes are one of the most important 
mechanisms underlying abnormal neuronal excitation and disturbances in the 
cellular resting membrane potential. These variants can cause different forms of 
epilepsy, which can seriously affect the physical and mental health of patients, 
especially those with refractory epilepsy or status epilepticus, which are 
common among pediatric patients and are potentially life-threatening. Variants 
in potassium ion channel-related genes have been reported in few studies; 
however, to our knowledge, no systematic review has been published. This study 
aimed to summarize the epilepsy phenotypes, functional studies, and 
pharmacological advances associated with different potassium channel gene 
variants to assist clinical practitioners and drug development teams to develop 
evidence-based medicine and guide research strategies. PubMed and Google Scholar 
were searched for relevant literature on potassium channel-related epilepsy 
reported in the past 5-10 years. Various common potassium ion channel gene 
variants can lead to heterogeneous epilepsy phenotypes, and functional effects 
can result from gene deletions and compound effects. Administration of select 
anti-seizure medications is the primary treatment for this type of epilepsy. 
Most patients are refractory to anti-seizure medications, and some novel 
anti-seizure medications have been found to improve seizures. Use of targeted 
drugs to correct aberrant channel function based on the type of potassium 
channel gene variant can be used as an evidence-based pathway to achieve precise 
and individualized treatment for children with epilepsy. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: 
In this article, the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of epilepsy 
caused by different types of potassium channel gene variants are reviewed in the 
light of the latest research literature at home and abroad, with the expectation 
of providing a certain theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of 
children with this type of disease.
