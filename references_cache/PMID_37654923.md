Dieulafoy lesions are an extremely rare disease that can cause gastrointestinal 
bleeding and colon bleeding. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding caused by a 
transverse colonic Dieulafoy lesion is extremely rare. This study describes the 
case of a 68-year-old woman who took oral rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation 
and presented with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding associated with a 
rare transverse colonic Dieulafoy lesion. Hemostasis was successfully achieved 
by thermal coagulation and the application of endoscopic hemoclips. Lastly, we 
reviewed previous literature on the diagnosis and treatment of colonic Dieulafoy 
disease.
