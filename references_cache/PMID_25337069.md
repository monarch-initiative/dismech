Distal arthrogryposis (DA) is a group of rare, clinically and genetically 
heterogeneous disorders primarily characterized by congenital contractures of 
the distal limb joints without a neuromuscular disease. Mutations in at least 8 
different genes have been shown to cause DA. Here, we report a 4-generation 
Indian family with 18 affected members presenting variable features of 
camptodactyly, brachydactyly, syndactyly, decreased flexion palmar creases, 
ulnar deviation of the hands, sandal gaps and club feet. We undertook exome 
sequencing of 3 distantly related affected individuals. Bioinformatics filtering 
revealed a known pathogenic missense mutation c.188G>A (p.Arg63His) in TNNT3 in 
all 3 affected individuals that segregated with the phenotype. The affected 
individuals exhibit significant phenotypic variability. This study demonstrates 
the value of exome sequencing helping to define the causative variant in 
genetically heterogeneous disorders.
