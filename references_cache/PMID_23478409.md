Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an inherited disorder of branched chain 
amino acid metabolism presenting with neonatal encephalopathy, episodic 
metabolic decompensation, and chronic amino acid imbalances. Dietary management 
enables survival and reduces risk of acute crises. Liver transplantation has 
emerged as an effective way to eliminate acute decompensation risk. Psychiatric 
illness is a reported MSUD complication, but has not been well characterized and 
remains poorly understood. We report the prevalence and characteristics of 
neuropsychiatric problems among 37 classical MSUD patients (ages 5-35 years, 26 
on dietary therapy, 11 after liver transplantation) and explore their underlying 
mechanisms. Compared with 26 age-matched controls, MSUD patients were at higher 
risk for disorders of cognition, attention, and mood. Using quantitative proton 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found lower brain glutamate, 
N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and creatine concentrations in MSUD patients, which 
correlated with specific neuropsychiatric outcomes. Asymptomatic neonatal course 
and stringent longitudinal biochemical control proved fundamental to optimizing 
long-term mental health. Neuropsychiatric morbidity and neurochemistry were 
similar among transplanted and nontransplanted MSUD patients. In conclusion, 
amino acid dysregulation results in aberrant neural networks with neurochemical 
deficiencies that persist after transplant and correlate with neuropsychiatric 
morbidities. These findings may provide insight into general mechanisms of 
psychiatric illness.
