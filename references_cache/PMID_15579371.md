The prevalence of occupational asthma is rising, possibly due to the 
introduction of different chemicals and substances in the workplace. Etiologic 
agents include organic and inorganic compounds that are encountered in a variety 
of industries. Early diagnosis, adequate management of inflammation, and 
prevention of further exposure are essential to occupational asthma management. 
Reducing complications and disability while providing work rehabilitation should 
be the ultimate goal of the health care provider. This article discusses these 
issues and gives guidance to the clinician treating patients with possible 
occupational asthma.
