Cardiac fibroblasts are known to have high affinity corticoid receptors for 
aldosterone and account for the accumulation of collagen within the interstitium 
of the rat myocardium in acquired and genetic hypertension. This interstitial 
fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy in chronic heart 
failure. To examine the relationship between aldosterone and myocardial 
fibrosis, collagen volume fraction of the left and right ventricles were 
analyzed by videodensitometry of sirius red stained tissue in the following rat 
models: 2 kidney/1 clip model of renovascular hypertension; continuous 
aldosterone administration via osmotic minipumps (0.75 microgram/hour s.c.), or 
in each model of primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism with concomitant 
treatment with either low (20 mg/kg/day) or high doses (200 mg/kg/day) of s.c. 
spironolactone for 8 weeks as well as in age matched controls. Systolic arterial 
pressure and left ventricular weight normalized to body weight were each 
increased with either model of experimental hypertension and were normalized 
with high-dose spironolactone treatment. Myocardial fibrosis induced by chronic 
aldosterone administration was comparable to renovascular hypertension and 
occurred in the pressure overloaded, hypertrophied left and in the normotensive, 
nonhypertrophied right ventricle. The competitive aldosterone receptor 
antagonist, spironolactone, was able to prevent fibrosis in both ventricles in 
either model of arterial hypertension irrespective of the development of left 
ventricular hypertrophy and hypertension. To examine whether aldosterone 
stimulates collagen synthesis in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts collagen 
synthesis, normalized per total protein synthesis, was measured by 3H-proline 
incorporation in cultured fibroblasts after 24 hours incubation with aldosterone 
at 10(-11) to 10(-6) M concentrations, or with 10(-9) M aldosterone + 10(-9) M 
spironolactone. Under serum-free conditions, aldosterone was able to stimulate 
collagen synthesis in a dose-dependent manner and at concentrations (10(-9) M) 
which were comparable to stimulated states in vivo (e.g., renovascular 
hypertension, or chronic heart failure). At equimolar concentrations, 
spironolactone abolished the aldosterone-mediated increase in collagen 
synthesis. Thus, in-vivo and in-vitro evidence could be provided that the 
mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, plays a pivotal role in promoting myocardial 
fibrosis and that could be antagonized by its competitive receptor blocker, 
spironolactone. These cardioprotective effects of spironolactone may explain the 
prognostic value of anti-aldosterone therapy in patients with severe chronic 
heart failure evaluated in the RALES mortality trial.
