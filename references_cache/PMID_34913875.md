People living with hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection are exposed to high 
rates of liver complications including end-stage liver disease and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrahepatic manifestations of HBV infection have long 
been underestimated. Several of these extrahepatic syndromes have been well 
described, including systemic vasculitides, glomerulonephritis, and cutaneous 
manifestations. Other manifestations have been more recently described such as 
hematological malignancies and neurological diseases. These extrahepatic 
manifestations are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although 
not completely understood, underlying mechanisms include HBV-induced local and 
systemic inflammation. Suppression of HBV replication usually improves 
extrahepatic manifestations. This review will discuss how HBV induces 
inflammation and the extrahepatic manifestations of HBV infection to guide 
clinical management.
