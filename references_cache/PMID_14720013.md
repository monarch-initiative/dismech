Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that affects 
approximately 100 million people worldwide. In order to reduce symptoms, improve 
pulmonary function, and decrease morbidity, current treatment guidelines 
emphasize the importance of controlling the underlying inflammation in patients 
with asthma. Leukotrienes are leukocyte-generated lipid mediators that promote 
airway inflammation. Recognition of the importance of leukotrienes in the 
pathogenesis of asthma has led to the development of leukotriene modifiers, the 
first new class of drugs for the treatment of asthma to become available in 25 
years. Controlled clinical trials with the four currently used leukotriene 
modifiers (montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton in the US and pranlukast in 
Japan) have established their efficacy in improving pulmonary function, reducing 
symptoms, decreasing night-time awakenings, and decreasing the need for rescue 
medications. They exert anti-inflammatory effects that attenuate cellular 
infiltration and bronchial hyperresponsiveness and complement the 
anti-inflammatory properties of inhaled corticosteroids. In patients with 
moderate and severe asthma, they permit tapering of the corticosteroid dose. In 
patients with exercise-induced asthma, leukotriene modifiers limit the decline 
in and quicken the recovery of pulmonary functions without the tolerance issues 
seen with chronic long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist use. In patients with 
aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)-induced asthma, they improve pulmonary function 
and shift the dose response curve to the right, reducing the patient's response 
to aspirin. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with or without 
concomitant asthma, they improve nasal, eye, and throat symptoms as well as 
quality of life. Leukotriene modifiers are generally safe and well tolerated 
with adverse effect profiles similar to that of placebo. The one safety issue 
raised with leukotriene modifiers, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, appears to be the 
unmasking of an already present syndrome that is manifested when the leukotriene 
modifiers permit corticosteroid doses to be reduced. Although current treatment 
guidelines recommend their use in patients with mild persistent asthma, these 
guidelines were developed just as leukotriene modifiers were coming to the 
market, before much of the clinical efficacy data were published. Because asthma 
is a heterogeneous disease, the different asthma phenotypes respond differently 
to therapies; consequently asthma therapy needs to be individualized. 
Leukotriene modifiers increase the therapeutic options for patients with asthma 
and, based on recent data, it is expected that future guidelines will describe 
expanded uses for these agents in clinical circumstances where these drugs are 
effective.
