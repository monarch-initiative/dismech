PURPOSE: H3 K27-altered diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a molecularly defined, 
highly aggressive tumor entity since the 2016 revision of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). 
It has been most extensively characterized in children and adolescents and 
continues to pose significant challenges to treating physicians due to its 
growth along the midline structures of the brain and its ability to progress 
distantly leading to poor prognosis. Clinical and molecular determinants of 
distant progression and its impact on patient survival particularly in adults 
have not been thoroughly characterized.
METHODS: This retrospective multicenter cohort study of 52 adult patients with 
DMG was analyzed for clinical and molecular predictors of distant tumor 
progression using gene panel sequencing and genome-wide DNA methylation arrays.
RESULTS: Distant progression including leptomeningeal disease occurred in 10 out 
of 52 adult patients (19%), seven of which had a primary spinal tumor location 
(70%, p < 0.001) and almost 80% of patients with spinal DMG experienced distant 
progression. Across the entire cohort, distant progression was associated with 
worse progression free survival (PFS) (4.5 vs. 13 months; p = 0.037). However, 
we could not identify a genetic or methylation-based signature that was 
significantly correlated with the occurrence of distant progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Adult DMGs with spinal location are at a high risk of early distant 
progression. As there were no molecular determinants of distant progression from 
differential methylation, copy number alterations (CNA) or panel sequencing, 
adult patients with DMG should undergo routine craniospinal MRI, particularly in 
spinal tumor location.

• Distant progression occurs in one fifth of adult DMG patients, predominantly 
in tumors with spinal location. • Distant progression is associated with shorter 
progression-free survival and spinal tumor location. • There are no molecular 
signatures based on methylation, CNAs or panel sequencing that are associated 
with the risk of distant progression.
