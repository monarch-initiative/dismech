Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) is the 
necessary cause of cervical cancer. In the Philippines, available data on the 
prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV infections are limited and largely 
derived from earlier hospital-based studies. The present study determined the 
overall and type-specific prevalence of HR HPV infection among women in selected 
communities in the Philippines, along with the associated sociodemographic and 
behavioral factors. A total of 1,194 women from two communities were examined. 
Cervical swabs were collected, and the extracted DNA were analyzed for HPV 
genotyping through a commercial multiplex real-time PCR assay kit. 
Sociodemographic information, clinical history, and sexual and reproductive 
behavior were obtained through an interviewer-administered semi-structured 
questionnaire. The overall prevalence of HR HPV infection was 11.22 % (95 % CI: 
9.56-13.14 %). Women residing in urban areas had 1.62 times higher odds (95 % 
CI: 1.08-2.42) of HR HPV infection than those in rural areas. Moreover, for 
every year of delaying vaginal sexual debut, there was a 7 % decrease in the 
odds of HR HPV infection. HPV 52 was the most prevalent genotype (2.59 %), 
followed by HPV 16 (1.84 %) and HPV 68 (1.09 %). Multiple HR HPV genotypes were 
recorded in 23 % of HR HPV-infected women. The most frequent co-infections are 
HPV 16 + HPV 18, HPV 16 + HPV 52, and HPV 39 + HPV 52. These findings highlight 
the need for updated surveillance and consideration of local genotype 
distribution in cervical cancer prevention strategies, such as in HPV DNA 
testing and HPV vaccination programs.
