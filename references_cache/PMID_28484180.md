Ebolaviruses, members of the family Filoviridae, cause severe hemorrhagic fever 
in humans and nonhuman primates, with human case fatality rates of up to 90%. No 
effective prophylaxis or treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD) is yet 
commercially available. During the latest outbreak of EVD in West Africa, 
several unapproved drugs were used for the treatment of patients. This outbreak 
has indeed accelerated efforts to develop antiviral strategies and some of the 
vaccine and drug candidates have undergone clinical trials. This article reviews 
previous researches and recent advances on the development of vaccine, 
therapeutics, and diagnostics for EVD.
