Retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction (RCPD) is a fairly recently described 
condition that has been gaining traction online. Majority of patients arrive at 
the diagnosis themselves, after undergoing numerous inconclusive investigations, 
indicating that widespread dissemination within the medical community remains to 
be seen. We present two cases, the first describes the successful medical 
management of a 17-year-old male who was treated with rikkunshito, a Kampo 
medicine, combined with mosapride, an established prokinetic agent. The second 
case involves a 30-year-old female with refractory symptoms who was effectively 
managed with endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy. She had previously undergone 
percutaneous botulinum toxin injection that initially provided temporary relief. 
Both patients experienced a lifelong inability to belch, and had previous 
unrevealing diagnostic evaluations. Prior to treatment, high-resolution 
manometry was performed on both patients, showing elevated basal upper 
esophageal sphincter (UES) pressure and absence of UES relaxation with attempted 
belching. These findings finally led to a diagnosis of RCPD. Increased clinician 
awareness of RCPD could potentially spare patients from a meandering clinical 
course. Alternative medicine, such as rikkunshito, could be a potential adjunct 
for patients unwilling to undergo procedures. For refractory cases and those 
intolerant of repeated injections, more extensive surgery, including 
cricopharyngeal myotomy, may be offered.
