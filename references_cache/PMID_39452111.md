Inner ear disorders, including sensorineural hearing loss, Meniere's disease, 
and vestibular neuritis, are prevalent conditions that significantly impact the 
quality of life. Despite their high incidence, the underlying pathophysiology of 
these disorders remains elusive, and current treatment options are often 
inadequate. Emerging evidence suggests that pericytes, a type of vascular mural 
cell specialized to maintain the integrity and function of the microvasculature, 
may play a crucial role in the development and progression of inner ear 
disorders. The pericytes are present in the microvasculature of both the cochlea 
and the vestibular system, where they regulate blood flow, maintain the 
blood-labyrinth barrier, facilitate angiogenesis, and provide trophic support to 
neurons. Understanding their role in inner ear disorders may provide valuable 
insights into the pathophysiology of these conditions and lead to the 
development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, improving the 
standard of living. This comprehensive review aims to provide a detailed 
overview of the role of pericytes in inner ear disorders, highlighting the 
anatomy and physiology in the microvasculature, and analyzing the mechanisms 
that contribute to the development of the disorders. Furthermore, we explore the 
potential pericyte-targeted therapies, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
and angiogenic approaches, as well as gene therapy strategies.
