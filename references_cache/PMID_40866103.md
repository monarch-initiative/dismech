A woman in her 20 s with a remote history of chronic iritis and bilateral 
sensorineural hearing loss presented with proptosis, eye pain, blurred vision 
and elevated intraocular pressures. Her medical history was significant for 
end-stage renal disease and congestive heart failure. Imaging was limited due to 
cochlear implants and a cardioverter defibrillator. Infectious and autoimmune 
investigations were negative. After initial management with topical 
pressure-lowering drops, she was started on systemic corticosteroids with rapid 
improvement in visual acuity and resolution of symptoms. The diagnosis of 
atypical Cogan syndrome was made by exclusion, based on her exam findings, 
ocular and auditory history, systemic features and positive clinical response to 
treatment. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of atypical Cogan 
syndrome, particularly in the setting of delayed symptom onset and systemic 
involvement. Early recognition is essential, as timely corticosteroid therapy 
may prevent irreversible vision and hearing loss.
