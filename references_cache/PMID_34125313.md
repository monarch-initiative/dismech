PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Molecular drivers are increasingly identified as therapeutic 
targets for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This review focuses on the role 
of ROS1 inhibitors in treating relapsed/metastatic ROS-1 altered (ROS1+) NSCLC.
RECENT FINDINGS: Four FDA-approved drugs have significant activity against ROS1+ 
NSCLC: crizotinib, ciritinib, lorlatinib, and entrectinib. Each drug yields an 
overall response rates exceeding 60% with ciritinib, lorlatinib, and entrectinib 
possessing intracranial activity. The drugs have manageable toxicity profiles. 
ROS1 alterations are rare molecular drivers of NSCLC that can be effectively 
treated with a variety of ROS1-targetd drugs. New agents are being identified 
that may treat resistance mutations.
