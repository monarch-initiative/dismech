We reviewed gastrointestinal manifestations in 40 patients with amyloidosis. 
Gastrointestinal symptoms included anorexia, macroglossia, intestinal 
pseudo-obstruction, and altered bowel habits. Hepatomegaly was detected in eight 
patients, but none had clinically significant infiltrative liver disease. 
Mucosal friability and erosions were common endoscopic findings. Barium enema 
was noncontributory in the diagnosis of amyloidosis, since colonoscopy disclosed 
mucosal abnormalities in three of six patients with normal radiographic 
findings. Rectal biopsy had the highest diagnostic yield, followed by duodenal, 
gastric, and colonic biopsies.
