# Genome-wide analysis of gene expression of ascending aorta from patients with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection

## Content

Differentially expressed genes were identified by comparing the gene expression profiling of dissected ascending aorta with that of control. Results provide important information to indicate pathogenesis of aortic dissection.
