Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) research has been characterized by 
two waves. Initial interest was piqued by its discovery in 1973 as a contaminant 
of myosin preparations from skeletal muscle. The second wave started in 1995 by 
the discovery that mutations in the gene encoding cMyBP-C cause hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM). In this review, we will address what is known of cMyBP-C's 
role as a regulator of contraction as well as its role in HCM.
