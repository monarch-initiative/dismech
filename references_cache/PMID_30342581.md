Asthma is a chronic disease that affects children and adults with significant 
morbidity and mortality. It is multifactorial, with genetic and environmental 
factors affecting the overall course of the disease. Both specific and total 
immunoglobulin (Ig)E can be used in specific phenotypes such as allergic asthma. 
Using IgE as a biomarker for asthma provides a target for management and 
treatment. Biotherapeutics continue to emerge as important advances in asthma 
treatment, and their effect on IgE and its biomarker role continue to be 
studied.
