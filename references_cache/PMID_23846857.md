OBJECTIVE: Developing categorical diagnoses that have biological meaning within 
the clinical phenotype of psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, 
and bipolar I disorder with psychosis) is as important for developing targeted 
treatments as for nosological goals. The Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on 
Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) was formed to examine a broad array of 
intermediate phenotypes across psychotic disorders and to test the hypothesis 
that intermediate phenotype characteristics are homogeneous within 
phenomenologically derived DSM-IV diagnoses.
METHOD: The consortium recruited 933 stable probands with schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic bipolar I disorder, 1,055 of their 
first-degree relatives, and 459 healthy comparison subjects for clinical 
characterization and dense phenotyping. Clinical, psychosocial, and family 
characteristics were contrasted.
RESULTS: All proband groups showed lower psychosocial functioning than the 
relatives or comparison group. On average, schizophrenia probands showed more 
symptoms and lower psychosocial functioning than probands with psychotic bipolar 
disorder, but there was considerable overlap in clinical manifestations. The 
characteristics of schizoaffective disorder were more often similar to 
schizophrenia than to psychotic bipolar disorder. The rates of lifetime suicide 
attempts were high across all proband groups, with the highest reported 
frequencies in the schizoaffective and bipolar groups. Proband family lineages 
included both families with "pure" psychosis diagnoses and families with mixed 
schizophrenia-bipolar diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and familial lineage overlap 
across the three DSM-IV psychosis diagnoses used in B-SNIP. The comingling of 
psychosis diagnoses within families suggests overlapping genetic determinants 
across psychoses. These data provide scant evidence for distinct phenotypic 
clustering around traditional phenomenological diagnoses.
