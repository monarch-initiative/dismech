# Phase II Trial of Weekly Erlotinib Dosing to Reduce Duodenal Polyp Burden Associated With Familial Adenomatous Polyposis

## Content

This phase II trial studies the side effects of erlotinib hydrochloride and how well it works in reducing duodenal polyp burden in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis at risk of developing colon cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
