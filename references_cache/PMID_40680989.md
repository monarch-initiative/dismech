INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the link between oral conditions and odontogenic 
infections requiring hospitalization is limited. This study examines the 
variables associated with hospitalization due to odontogenic infections and 
calculates the risk for hospitalization for specific endodontic conditions.
METHODS: Consecutive patients hospitalized over 9 years in a Swedish region for 
odontogenic infections were included. Patient records and previous dental 
treatments were reviewed. Descriptive statistics were used, and the population 
was compared with control data from government statistics, national health 
registries, and other Swedish studies. Absolute risks for hospitalization due to 
endodontic conditions were calculated.
RESULTS: The sample study included 97 patients (mean age 47.03, 52 males). 
Hospitalized individuals were more often smokers and had psychiatric diagnoses 
(P = .001). Most hospitalizations (80%) were due to odontogenic infections 
originating from the mandibular molar region, with nearly half (49.5%) linked to 
endodontic infections. The absolute risk for primary apical periodontitis 
(AP)was 20.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 individuals/year, whereas the absolute 
risk for secondary AP (ie, root-filled tooth and AP) was 0.7 per 100,000 
individuals/year. The risk of hospitalization following root canal treatment was 
30 per 100,000 treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization due to odontogenic infections remains rare. 
However, the risk of hospitalization increases in patients with mandibular molar 
infections and who smoke, have specific diagnosed mental health disorders, or 
seek dental care only during acute situations.
