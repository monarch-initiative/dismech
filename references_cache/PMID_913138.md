Death-producing hemoptysis in tuberculosis.

Middleton JR, Sen P, Lange M, Salaki J, Kapila R, Louria DB.

Massive hemoptysis in patients with tuberculosis is reported infrequently and 
then virtually always in association with cavitary disease or aspergilloma. In 
contrast, we describe herein five cases characterized by hemoptysis on 
admission, bilateral pulmonary disease, samples of sputum positive for acid-fast 
bacilli by Ziehl-Neelsen stain, and no obvious cavitary disease. In each, 
hemoptysis subsided and then suddenly recurred in prodigious amounts, leading to 
death, probably from asyphyxiation. In patients hospitalized with tuberculous 
hemoptysis of any amount, with or without an obvious cavity, aggressive 
diagnostic evaluation, including bronchoscopic examination, may define the site 
of bleeding, thus permitting rapid surgical intervention if the hemoptysis 
increases.
