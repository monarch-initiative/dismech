Aeroallergen sensitization occurs in most patients with asthma and is noted in a 
high percentage of patients with mild and moderate asthma. The percentage of 
those that are atopic with severe asthma appears less, but still approximates 
the percent seen in patients with mild and moderate asthma. The objective of 
this study was to review the prevalence of positive skin tests and atopic 
disease in patients with asthma. A review was performed of the literature with 
searches to include "skin test and asthma," "allergic asthma," and "allergies 
and asthma" in both PubMed and Ovid and selected articles that were relative to 
our objective. Most studies highlight the significances that allergic disease 
plays in asthma. However, the prevalence of allergic disease in mild to moderate 
asthma ranges from 50 to 95% and recent data suggest that 95% may be very 
accurate. In severe asthma the percentage is less, but still recent data suggest 
it may be as high as 90%. Patients with high IgE, high exhaled nitric oxide 
(eNO), low provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in 
forced expiratory ventilation in 1 second (PC(20)) and minority ethnicity have a 
higher number of positive skin tests and presumably are hypersensitive to more 
aeroallergens. Patients with late-onset asthma are less likely to be allergic; 
nonetheless, the vast majority even >65 years of age have an allergic component 
to their disease. Female gender, late-onset asthma, nasal polyps, severe asthma, 
and, possibly, patients with a reaction to autologous serum injection increases 
the likelihood that asthma may be nonallergic, as defined by negative skin 
tests. The vast majority of patients with mild-to-moderate and even severe 
asthma have an allergic component to their disease. Avoidance, omalizumab, and 
allergen immunotherapy may be useful in all severities of asthma, even in the 
elderly, if indicated and not contraindicated. As many as 90-95% of patients 
with asthma have aeroallergen sensitization and the pattern varies with 
ethnicity, location of residence, and onset of asthma, but not age. Higher 
levels of IgE and eNO and lower values of PC(20), are noted in patients with 
asthma and aeroallergen sensitization.
