The present study details work done at the National Public Health Laboratory in 
Haiti (LNSP), comparing the results of a cholera rapid diagnostic test (RDT) 
with culture-based methods. As of October 21, 2011, 644 specimens were tested by 
both RDT and culture-based method at the LNSP. The sensitivity and specificity 
of RDT were 95% and 80%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 89% 
and negative predictive value of 91%. In resource-limited settings, the RDT has 
good utility and should be considered as part of the laboratory testing 
algorithm.
