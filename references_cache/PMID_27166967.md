PURPOSE: Predicting the feasibility of platinum-based chemotherapy remains an 
important issue in elderly (over 70 years) patients with non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for the 
early serious adverse events (SAEs) (during cycles 1-2) in elderly receiving 
platinum-based chemotherapy, and to explore the clinical characteristics of 
patients who require early treatment termination without progressive disease 
(PD).
METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eight consecutive elderly NSCLC patients 
receiving platinum-based chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: The median age was 73 years (range 70-83). 161 (81 %) were males, and 
190 (95 %) were PS 0-1. Fifty-one (29 %) and 39 (19 %) patients developed early 
non-hematological SAEs and hematological SAEs, respectively. Multivariate 
analysis identified low serum albumin (<3.0 g/dl) as an independent risk factor 
for non-hematological SAEs, while low creatinine clearance (<45 ml/min) for 
hematological SAEs. In all, 24 (12 %) patients needed early treatment 
termination without PD. The major reason for this event was the development of 
non-hematological SAEs (4.5 %), followed by grade 2 non-hematological adverse 
events (AEs) (3 %). In multivariate analysis, age over 75 years and low serum 
albumin were associated with this event. The median overall survival (OS) in 
patients with this event was only 6.0 months, while the development of early SAE 
was not associated with poor OS.
CONCLUSION: Baseline serum albumin might be useful for predicting the 
feasibility of platinum-based chemotherapy, and the risk estimation of early 
treatment termination without PD might be beneficial for the treatment selection 
in elderly NSCLC patients.
