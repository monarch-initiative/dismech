There is considerable concern about the long-term consequences of COVID-19 
infection, generally referred to as post-acute sequelae, including declines in 
cognitive and motor abilities. The degree to which COVID-19 contributes 
additional burden to normal aging trajectories remains unclear. Additionally, 
the impact of COVID-19 on subjects under study for age-related neurological 
diseases is a potential confounder that needs definition. This study 
investigated whether having had a COVID-19 illness was associated with a 
differential decline in cognitive or motor function in older adults, utilizing 
data from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND) 
and Brain and Body Donation Program (BBDP), a longitudinal clinicopathological 
study based in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Subjects were included if they 1) 
had completed a questionnaire about their experience with COVID-19 illness 2) 
were classified as cognitively normal at pre-pandemic diagnostic cognitive 
consensus conferences and 3) had one or more subsequent diagnostic conferences 
between July 1, 2020 and August 30, 2025. All subjects had serial standardized 
research-dedicated clinical evaluations including the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). 
Specific objectives were to compare, between those who reported having had or 
not having had COVID-19, rates of conversion to cognitive impairment or dementia 
as well as pre-pandemic and final MoCA and UPDRS motor scores. A total of 100 
subjects self-reported having had COVID-19 while 71 denied having had it. Their 
related acute illness severity was generally mild, with only 10% having had 
hospital treatment and none having required ventilator support. Post-acute 
symptoms were also mild; only 1 subject reported having "long Covid". Both 
cognitive and motor performance, as measured by MoCA and UPDRS part 3 scores, 
declined slightly (not statistically significant) over the study period. 
Conversion of cognitive diagnosis from normal to impaired or dementia occurred 
in 26% of those having had COVID-19 and in 32% of those not having had COVID-19; 
the difference was not significant. All subjects diagnosed with PD at the start 
of the study were also diagnosed with PD at the end of the study; no subjects 
converted from not having to having probable PD. Logistic regression analysis 
indicated that subjects' report of having had COVID-19 was not significantly 
associated with conversion to cognitive impairment or dementia while greater 
age, male sex, possession of one or more apolipoprotein E- ɛ4 alleles, and a 
diagnosis of probable PD all conferred a significantly greater likelihood of 
conversion. The results suggest that having a mild COVID-19 illness is not 
associated with greater declines on cognitive or motor screening tests than 
would be expected from age-related changes alone. Limitations of this analysis 
include small sample sizes, potential misclassification of COVID-19 status, and 
reliance on relatively crude clinical metrics that may miss significant 
functional changes. Additionally, we were unable to separately assess for 
varying COVID-19 severity dependent on whether or not the subject had been 
vaccinated, the number and type of vaccinations, and the particular SARS-CoV-2 
variants that were circulating at the time of illness.
