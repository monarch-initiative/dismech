Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) was first described as a syndrome characterized 
by PTH resistance combined with skeletal abnormalities known as Albright's 
hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). Studies have since focused on genetic or 
epigenetic alterations underlying PHP and related disorders. The α-subunit of 
the stimulatory G protein (Gsα) mediates the signaling of G protein-coupled 
receptors that stimulate cAMP generation. The Gsα-cAMP cascade is pivotal for 
human skeletal growth, as evidenced by pathogenic mutations converging on this 
signaling pathway in a spectrum of skeletal dysplasias that overlap with AHO. 
The gene encoding Gsα, GNAS, is subject to genomic imprinting, an epigenetic 
mechanism governing allele-specific gene expression through differential 
methylation. Parental allele contribution to Gsα expression differs among 
tissues. While Gsα is biallelically transcribed in most tissues, including bone 
and cartilage, the paternal Gsα allele is suppressed in a limited number of 
cells/tissues, including the proximal renal tubule, where PTH exerts critical 
actions. Therefore, Gsα mutations cause distinct clinical manifestations 
according to the affected parental allele. While maternal mutations result in 
PHP type 1A, which consists of PTH resistance and AHO, paternal mutations lead 
to pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP), that is, AHO without hormone 
resistance. Epigenetic alterations of GNAS cause PHP type 1B (PHP1B), defined by 
PTH resistance in the absence of AHO. Thus, genomic imprinting plays a key role 
in the phenotypes associated with GNAS alterations. Investigations on the 
genetic cause of PHP1B have identified crucial imprinting control regions of 
GNAS, whose functions were elucidated only recently using human embryonic stem 
cells to model imprinting regulatory mechanisms in the early embryo. We herein 
review the current understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of PHP and 
related disorders, focusing on their skeletal manifestations.

Plain Language Summary: Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is characterized by PTH 
resistance with skeletal and developmental abnormalities. 
Pseudohypoparathyroidism results from genetic or epigenetic alterations 
affecting the GNAS gene. GNAS encodes the stimulatory G protein α-subunit, a 
signaling mediator essential for human skeletal growth. GNAS undergoes genomic 
imprinting, that is, transcriptional regulation occurs differently on each 
parental allele. This epigenetic mechanism plays a key role in the phenotypes of 
PHP and related disorders. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular basis of 
GNAS imprinting, revealing the mechanisms that operate during early embryonic 
stages. Such advances enabled a logical approach to the molecular diagnosis of 
PHP.
