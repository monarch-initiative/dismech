[Article in English, French]

In 1996, Vibrio cholerae O1 biotype E1 Tor continued to occur in all regions of 
the world (Map 1). The decrease in the number of cases observed since 1994 
continued in 1996, with a total of 143 349 cases and 6689 deaths officially 
reported to WHO. The decrease in the number of cases is not reflected in the 
global case-fatality rate (CFR), which increased to 4.7% compared with 2.4% in 
1995. The number of countries reporting cholera to WHO decreased from 78 in 1995 
to 71 in 1996 (Table 1 and Figs. 1-3). Africa is the continent accounting for 
the largest proportion of all reported cholera cases. The incidence of cholera 
increased by 53%, from 71081 cases in 1995 to 108535 cases in 1996. The CFR in 
Africa reached 5.7%, representing the highest figure in all the regions. The 
Americas reported an important decrease in the number of cases, from 85 809 in 
1995 to 24643 in 1996, i.e. 71%. In Asia, 10 142 cases were reported in 1996, 
but a few countries which reported high incidence rates in 1995 have not yet 
sent their final report to WHO. It is estimated that a decrease of about 30% 
will be observed in Asia once final reports have been received.
