Submandibular Sialolithiasis Mimicking Ludwig's Angina: A Case Report and Brief 
Clinical Review.

Huang CT, Lien WC.

The "double tongue sign" is a characteristic finding in patients with Ludwig's 
angina, a potentially life-threatening infection due to airway compromise. 
Management primarily focuses on early airway protection and antibiotic 
administration. Submandibular sialolithiasis, on the other hand, could present 
with the double tongue sign without symptoms suggestive of airway involvement. 
Unlike Ludwig's angina, conservative treatment is usually the first-line 
approach for sialolithiasis. The importance of rapidly recognizing and 
distinguishing between the 2 conditions is emphasized through effective triage 
and risk stratification, particularly in rural areas where physicians are not 
readily available.
