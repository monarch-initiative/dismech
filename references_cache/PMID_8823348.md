Despite the proven efficacy of antipsychotic medication in the treatment of 
schizophrenia, a substantial proportion of patients derive little if any benefit 
from traditional medications. Though alternative strategies (e.g., increasing 
dosage, switching antipsychotic, or adding adjunctive medication) are frequently 
employed, success rates are often disappointing. Clozapine has shown to be 
effective in some poor or partially responsive patients in three prospective, 
random assignment, double-blind trials. Risperidone has not yet been extensively 
studied in treatment-resistant patients, but may also be a useful alternative.
