OBJECTIVE: To assess the longterm frequency of thrombotic recurrences, 
obstetrical complications, organ damage, severe comorbidities, and evolution 
toward connective tissue disease (CTD) in primary antiphospholipid syndrome 
(PAPS).
METHODS: Medical records of patients with PAPS followed in 6 centers for ≥ 15 
years were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients were studied: 88% women, followed between 
1983 and 2014 with a mean (± SD) age at diagnosis of 33 (± 10) years. During a 
median followup of 18 years (range 15-30), 50 patients (44%) had at least a 
thrombotic event for a total of 75 events and an annual incidence of 3.5%. 
Thromboses were more frequent in patients with previous thrombotic history (p = 
0.002). A catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome occurred in 6 patients (5%). 
The use of oral anticoagulants in patients with thrombotic onset did not appear 
to be protective against recurrences (p = 0.26). Fifty-two women had 87 
pregnancies, successful in 78%. Twenty-nine percent of patients accrued 
functional damage. Damage was significantly associated with a thrombotic history 
(p = 0.004) and with arterial events (p < 0.001), especially stroke, but not 
with demographics, serology, or treatment. Twenty-four major bleeding episodes 
were recorded in 18 patients, all receiving anticoagulants. Severe infections 
affected 6 patients (5%), with 1 fatality. A solid cancer was diagnosed in 8 
patients (7%). Altogether, 16 patients (14%) developed an autoimmune disease and 
13 (11%) a full-blown picture of CTD.
CONCLUSION: Despite therapy, a high proportion of patients experienced new 
thrombotic events and organ damage, while evolution toward CTD was infrequent.
