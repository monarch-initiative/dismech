Fluid therapy is the most important therapeutic measure in patients suffering 
from dehydration or hypovolemia owing to gastrointestinal diseases. The therapy 
should be tailored based on the patient's condition, physical examination, and 
diagnostic findings. The selection of the specific fluid therapy should be 
determined by specific abnormalities of the patient and the severity of the 
gastrointestinal disorder.
