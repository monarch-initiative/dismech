Down syndrome, trisomy of chromosome 21, is well investigated because it is a 
genetic disease with characteristic mental retardation and precocious dementia 
of Alzheimer type. Maternal serum markers of human chorionic gonadotrophin 
unconjugated estriol and amyloid precursor protein, nuchal skinfold on 
ultrasound and new genetic probes are developed to allow better detection of 
Down syndrome. The overproduction of A beta 42 because of excessive genes is 
thought to be a leading factor for early onset of dementia in Down syndrome 
adults. Animal models and transgenic mice may be helpful in determining the 
specific gene and pathogenesis for mental retardation and precocious dementia.
