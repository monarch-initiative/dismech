Acne vulgaris (AV) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, and cytokines such 
as interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-19 (IL-19), and C-reactive protein (CRP) 
are thought to contribute to its immunopathogenesis. This study investigated 
serum and salivary levels of CRP, IL-17, and IL-19 in patients with AV and 
examined their relationship with disease severity. A total of 99 participants 
aged 15-30 years were classified into Control (n = 28), Moderate AV (n = 43), 
and Severe AV (n = 28) groups using the Global Evaluation Acne (GEA) Scale. 
Serum and saliva samples were analyzed using ELISA and immunoturbidimetric 
assays. Statistical comparisons and correlation analyses were performed. Serum 
IL-17 levels were significantly higher in the control group compared to both 
acne groups (p < 0.05), with no gender-related differences. Salivary cytokine 
levels showed no significant group differences. However, IL-17 and IL-19 were 
strongly correlated in both saliva (r = 0.672, p < 0.005) and serum (r = 0.538, 
p < 0.005) across the entire study population. Serum and salivary CRP levels 
showed no significant differences between groups. In contrast to previous 
reports, our study found lower serum IL-17 levels in AV patients compared to 
healthy controls, challenging the assumption of its purely pro-inflammatory role 
and suggesting a potential compensatory or regulatory immune mechanism to 
maintain homeostasis. These findings may also reflect distinct physiological 
pathways between systemic interleukin activity and localized skin inflammation. 
Although salivary cytokine levels did not differ significantly among groups, 
strong intra-sample correlations highlight their interaction and support 
saliva's potential as a non-invasive tool for monitoring immune activity.
