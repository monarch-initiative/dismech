Fanconi anemia (FA) represents a paradigm of rare genetic diseases, where the 
quest for cause and cure has led to seminal discoveries in cancer biology. 
Although a total of 16 FA genes have been identified thus far, the biochemical 
function of many of the FA proteins remains to be elucidated. FA is rare, yet 
the fact that 5 FA genes are in fact familial breast cancer genes and FA gene 
mutations are found frequently in sporadic cancers suggest wider applicability 
in hematopoiesis and oncology. Establishing the interaction network involving 
the FA proteins and their associated partners has revealed an intersection of FA 
with several DNA repair pathways, including homologous recombination, DNA 
mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and translesion DNA synthesis. 
Importantly, recent studies have shown a major involvement of the FA pathway in 
the tolerance of reactive aldehydes. Moreover, despite improved outcomes in stem 
cell transplantation in the treatment of FA, many challenges remain in patient 
care.
