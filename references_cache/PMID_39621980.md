BACKGROUND: Kümmell disease (KD)-a rare and relatively complex spinal 
condition-is a type of posttraumatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture 
manifesting as a delayed collapse of a vertebral body. Although most patients 
with KD present with pain in the fracture area, some present with pain in the 
rib region or distal lumbosacral region, without pain in the fracture area, 
which poses challenges for diagnosing and treating KD.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore whether percutaneous kyphoplasty can alleviate 
pain distal to the fracture area caused by either Stage I or Stage II KD.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study.
SETTING: This study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on patients with Stage I or Stage 
II KD who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital from December 2021 
through October 2023. All patients were accompanied by pain distal to the 
fracture area (i.e., pain in the rib region or the distal lumbosacral region). 
All patients underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty. Postoperative follow-up 
thoracic or lumbar x-rays confirmed polymethylmethacrylate diffusion and 
vertebral reduction. Pain distal to the fracture area and functional impairment 
were evaluated at presurgery and at postsurgery one day, one week, and one 
month. In addition, the anterior, middle, and posterior vertebral heights and 
the Cobb angle were measured at pre- and postsurgery.
RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were enrolled; 39 (92.9%) were women. Their 
average age was 73.48 ± 8.81 years. The fracture segments with KD and pain 
distal to the fracture area were as follows: T7 (9 cases, 21.4%); T10 (9 cases, 
21.4%); and T8 (8 cases, 19.0%). The common location of pain distal to the 
fracture area was the rib region (30 cases, 71.4%). The preoperative Visual 
Analog Scale score of pain distal to the fracture area and the Oswestry 
Disability Index scores were significantly higher than those at postsurgery one 
day, one week, and one month. The heights of the anterior, middle, and posterior 
edges of the vertebrae on x-ray were significantly higher postoperatively than 
preoperatively. The Cobb angle of the fractured vertebrae was also higher 
postoperatively than preoperatively.
LIMITATIONS: Our study was conducted at a single center; single-center studies 
may introduce bias. Our study also had a relatively short follow-up time.
CONCLUSION: Patients with Stage I or Stage II KD may experience pain distal to 
the fracture area, which may effectively be alleviated by percutaneous 
kyphoplasty.
