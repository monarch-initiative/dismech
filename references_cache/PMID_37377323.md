Pediatric tetanus is a rare and forgotten disease in countries with high 
childhood tetanus toxoid vaccination rates. Therefore, the clinical 
manifestations, treatment and management of this potentially life-threatening 
disease are not well known. With a literature review and discussion of tetanus 
management in pediatric patients, we describe a clinical course of a rare and 
fatal but vaccine-preventable disease, the generalized tetanus, in an adolescent 
who was successfully treated.
