BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of chronic liver 
disease, which can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. A 
timely diagnosis allows for antiviral treatment, which can prevent liver-related 
complications. Conversely, a late diagnosis signals a missed opportunity for 
earlier care and treatment. Our objective was to measure the proportion of 
chronic HBV diagnoses that are made within 6 months of presentation with a liver 
disease-related complication and examine associated factors and trends over 
time.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We used provincial laboratory data to identify patients 
with chronic HBV diagnosed from 2003 to 2014. We measured the proportion who 
experienced a liver disease complication (decompensated cirrhosis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver transplant) within ±6 months of their HBV 
diagnosis date. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify 
factors associated with HBV diagnosis pericomplication. Of 18,434 patients with 
chronic HBV, 1,279 (6.9%) developed an HBV-related complication during the 
follow-up period. Among these, 570 (44.6%) had a first diagnosis 
pericomplication. HBV diagnosis pericomplication did not decrease over time and 
was independently associated with older age at HBV diagnosis, rural residence, 
alcohol use, and moderate to high levels of comorbidity. Female patients, 
immigrants, and those with more outpatient physician visits were less likely to 
have an HBV diagnosis pericomplication.
CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of patients with HBV-related complications are 
first diagnosed with HBV pericomplication. These signal missed opportunities for 
earlier detection and treatment. Our findings support expansion of HBV 
screening.
