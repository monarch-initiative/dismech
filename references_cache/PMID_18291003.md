OBJECTIVES: Insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) are effective in preventing 
nocturnally transmitted vector-borne diseases, but their effect on diurnally 
active dengue vectors has never been studied. We investigated the efficacy of 
ITNs in reducing Aedes aegypti populations and dengue transmission.
METHODS: A cluster-randomized trial was carried out in Leogane, Haiti between 
July 2003 and July 2004. The study area (1017 houses) was divided into 18 
sectors (clusters): nine received ITNs (Olyset(R) long-lasting insecticidal 
bednets) and nine were untreated controls. Entomological surveys [measuring 
Breteau (BI), house (HI), container (CI) and pupae per person (PPI) indices and 
oviposition activity] were undertaken at baseline and at 1 and 5 months 
post-intervention. All houses were georeferenced to enable spatial analysis. 
Control sectors received ITNs at 6 months, and a final entomological and 
attitudinal survey was undertaken at 12 months after baseline. Anti-dengue IgM 
seropositivity rates were measured at baseline and after 12 months. Efficacy of 
ITNs was assessed by WHO cone bioassays.
RESULTS: At 1-month post-intervention, entomological indices fell in all 
sectors, with HI and BI in the bednet sectors reduced by 6.7 (95% CI -10.6, 
-2.7; P < 0.01) and 8.4 (95% CI -14.1, -2.6; P < 0.01) respectively. Moreover at 
1 month, ovitraps in control sectors were significantly more likely to be 
positive than in bednet sectors (P < 0.01). By 5 months, all indices remained 
low and HI, CI and BI were also significantly lower than that of baseline in the 
control arm. Curiously, at 5 months, HI, CI and BI were lower in the control arm 
than that in the bednet arm. A final survey, 12 months after the initial 
baseline study (5 months after bednets had been given to all households) 
indicated that all indices were significantly lower than that at baseline (P < 
0.001). Control houses located within 50 m of a bednet house had significantly 
lower CI (Z = -2.67, P = 0.008) and PPI (Z = -2.19, P = 0.028) at 1 month, an 
effect that extended to 100 m by 5 months (Z = -2.03, P = 0.042 and Z = -2.37, P 
= 0.018 respectively), suggesting a spill-over effect of the bednets. An IgM 
serosurvey showed a 15.3% decrease (95% CI 5.0-25.5%, P < 0.01) in the number of 
IgM-positive individuals from baseline to12 months later.
CONCLUSIONS: Insecticide-treated bednets had an immediate effect on dengue 
vector populations after their introduction, and over the next 5-12 months, the 
presence of ITNs may have continued to affect vector populations and dengue 
transmission.
