BACKGROUND: Dostarlimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high 
affinity to PD-1, resulting in inhibition of binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2. We 
report interim data from patients with endometrial cancer (EC) participating in 
a phase I trial of single-agent dostarlimab.
METHODS: GARNET, an ongoing, single-arm, open-label, phase I trial of 
intravenous dostarlimab in advanced solid tumors, is being undertaken at 123 
sites. Two cohorts of patients with EC were recruited: those with dMMR/MSI-H 
disease (cohort A1) and those with proficient/stable (MMRp/MSS) disease (cohort 
A2). Patients received dostarlimab 500 mg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, then 
dostarlimab 1000 mg every 6 weeks until disease progression. The primary 
endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) per 
RECIST V.1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central review.
RESULTS: Screening began on April 10, 2017, and 129 and 161 patients with 
advanced EC were enrolled in cohorts A1 and A2, respectively. The median 
follow-up duration was 16.3 months (IQR 9.5-22.1) for cohort A1 and 11.5 months 
(IQR 11.0-25.1) for cohort A2. In cohort A1, ORR was 43.5% (95% CI 34.0% to 
53.4%) with 11 complete responses and 36 partial responses. In cohort A2, ORR 
was 14.1% (95% CI 9.1% to 20.6%) with three complete responses and 19 partial 
responses. Median DOR was not reached in either cohort. In the combined cohorts, 
the majority of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1-2 (75.5%), 
most commonly fatigue (17.6%), diarrhea (13.8%), and nausea (13.8%). Grade≥3 
TRAEs occurred in 16.6% of patients, and 5.5% discontinued dostarlimab because 
of TRAEs. No deaths were attributable to dostarlimab.
CONCLUSION: Dostarlimab demonstrated durable antitumor activity in both 
dMMR/MSI-H (ORR 43.5%) and MMRp/MSS EC (ORR 14.1%) with a manageable safety 
profile.
