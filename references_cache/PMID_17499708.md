Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is frequently associated with complications 
during pregnancy. Miscarriage and maternal thrombosis are the most common 
problems, but prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, pregnancy-induced 
hypertensive disorders, and pulmonary hypertension can complicate pregnancy as 
well. The correct treatment of these women requires an accurate preconceptual 
counseling and a close collaboration between obstetricians and physicians. 
Doppler studies of the umbilical and uterine arteries play an important role in 
predicting APS-related complications during pregnancy.
