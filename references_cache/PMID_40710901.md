Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare and severe neurodegenerative disorder 
inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by a deficiency of the 
enzyme hexosaminidase A, which is responsible for the degradation of GM2 
gangliosides-lipids that accumulate in the nerve cells of the central nervous 
system. The inability to break down these lipids leads to their progressive 
accumulation, resulting in irreversible brain damage. Mechanistically, TSD is 
caused by mutations in the HEXA gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of 
hexosaminidase A. These mutations disrupt enzyme activity and alter cellular 
pathways involved in lysosomal lipid degradation. Although Tay-Sachs 
specifically involves the alpha subunit, similar clinical features can be seen 
in Sandhoff disease, a related disorder caused by mutations in the HEXB gene, 
which encodes the beta subunit shared by hexosaminidase A and B. Tay-Sachs is 
classified into three clinical forms according to age of onset and symptom 
severity: the classic infantile form, which is the most common and severe; a 
juvenile (subacute) form; and an adult-onset form, which progresses more slowly 
and tends to present with milder symptoms. Diagnosis is based on enzymatic 
testing showing reduced or absent hexosaminidase A activity, confirmed by 
genetic testing. Prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling play a key role in 
prevention and reproductive decision-making, especially in high-risk 
populations. Although no curative treatment currently exists, ongoing research 
is exploring gene therapy, enzyme replacement, and pharmacological approaches. 
Certain compounds, such as gemfibrozil, have shown potential to slow symptom 
progression. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary care are essential to 
improving quality of life, although therapeutic options remain limited due to 
the progressive nature of the disease.
