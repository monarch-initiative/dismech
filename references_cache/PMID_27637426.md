The advent of precision medicine in non-small cell lung cancer has remarkably 
altered the direction of research and improved clinical outcomes. The 
identification of molecular subsets with differential response to targeted 
therapies began with the identification of epidermal growth factor receptor 
mutated tumors in subsets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Emboldened by 
unprecedented response rates to kinase inhibitors seen in that subset, the 
oncologic community searched for other molecular subsets featuring oncogene 
addiction. An early result of this search was the discovery of NSCLC driven by 
activating rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. In an 
astoundingly brief period following the recognition of ALK-positive NSCLC, 
details of the biology, clinicopathologic features, development of targeted 
inhibitors, mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, and new generations of 
treatment were elucidated. This review summarizes the current understanding of 
the pathologic features, diagnostic approach, treatment options, resistance 
mechanisms, and future research areas for ALK-positive NSCLC.
