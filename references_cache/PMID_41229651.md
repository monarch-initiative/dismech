BACKGROUND: Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome (MSMS) is an uncommon disorder 
characterized by internal frontal hyperostosis, obesity, neuropsychiatric 
symptoms, and often associated endocrine abnormalities, notably hypothyroidism. 
Acute presentations are rare and can pose diagnostic challenges, especially in 
the prehospital setting. We describe a rare acute presentation of 
Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome (MSM) involving neurological deterioration and 
respiratory failure, highlight the importance of early recognition and 
multidisciplinary management in improving outcomes.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset severe 
neurological impairment accompanied by acute respiratory distress, initially 
identified by prehospital emergency medical services. Prompt airway management, 
including endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, enabled 
stabilization and urgent transfer to hospital care. Neuroimaging revealed 
characteristic internal frontal bone thickening, confirming the diagnosis of 
MSMS. A multidisciplinary approach targeting the neurological, endocrine, and 
respiratory components led to progressive clinical improvement and a favourable 
recovery.
CONCLUSION: This case underscores the critical importance of early recognition 
of MSMS in acute, life-threatening presentations. Awareness of this rare 
syndrome among prehospital and emergency clinicians can facilitate timely 
intervention and improve patient outcomes.
LEARNING POINTS: Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome can exceptionally present with 
acute neurological and respiratory compromise, not just chronic neuropsychiatric 
symptoms. The presence of internal frontal hyperostosis, even if incidental, 
should prompt evaluation for underlying endocrine and neurological 
dysfunction.Timely airway management and correction of hormonal imbalances are 
essential to survival and recovery.Multidisciplinary collaboration is crucial in 
managing complex cases of Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome, especially in acute 
settings where diagnosis is challenging.
