Buruli ulcer is an indolent necrotizing disease of the skin, subcutaneous 
tissue, and bone that is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Buruli ulcer is 
presently the third most common mycobacterial disease of humans, after 
tuberculosis and leprosy, and the least understood of the three. The disease 
remained largely ignored by many national public health programs, but more 
recently, it has been recognized as an emerging health problem, primarily due to 
its frequent disabling and stigmatizing complications. The contribution 
discusses various aspects of Buruli ulcer, including its geographic 
distribution, incidence, and prevalence; mode of transmission, pathogenesis, and 
immunity; clinical manifestations; laboratory diagnosis; differential clinical 
diagnosis; and treatment.
