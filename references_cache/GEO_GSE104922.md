# Molecular subtype classification of urothelial carcinoma in Lynch syndrome

## Content

We aimed to provide a molecular description of Lynch syndrome-associated urothelial cancer in relation to molecular subtypes of sporadic bladder cancer. Whole genome mRNA expression profiles of 41 tumors and immunohistochemical stainings against FGFR3, KRT5, CCNB1, RB1, and CDKN2A (p16) of 37 tumors from Lynch syndrome patients were generated. Pathological data, microsatellite instability, anatomic location, and overall survival data was analyzed and compared with data from sporadic bladder cancer.
