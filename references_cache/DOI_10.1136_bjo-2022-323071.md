## Content

Stargardt macular dystrophy (Stargardt disease; STGD1; OMIM 248200) is the most prevalent inherited macular dystrophy. STGD1 is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by multiple pathogenic sequence variants in the largeABCA4gene (OMIM 601691). Major advances in understanding both the clinical and molecular features, as well as the underlying pathophysiology, have culminated in many completed, ongoing and planned human clinical trials of novel therapies.The aims of this concise review are to describe (1) the detailed phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the disease, multimodal imaging findings, natural history of the disease, and pathogenesis, (2) the multiple avenues of research and therapeutic intervention, including pharmacological, cellular therapies and diverse types of genetic therapies that have either been investigated or are under investigation and (3) the exciting novel therapeutic approaches on the translational horizon that aim to treat STGD1 by replacing the entire 6.8 kbABCA4open reading frame.
