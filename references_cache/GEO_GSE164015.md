# Epithelial miR-141 regulates IL-13-induced airway mucus production [single-cell RNA-seq]

## Content

We performed single cell RNA sequencing on bronchial cells from human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 4 independent study participants who had asthma and who underwent lung segmental allergen challenge with diluent or allergen (either house duse mite or cat). The goal was to assess total mRNAs in single cell preparations of bronchoalveolar lavage cells.
