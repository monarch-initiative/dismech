The emphasis in rheumatoid hand surgery has been on the MP joints, but the PIP 
joints are often involved with the boutonniere deformity being one common 
pattern. The pathology of the boutonniere begins with a synovitis of the joint, 
followed by elongation al the central slip, subluxation of the later bands, and 
contracture of the retinacular ligaments. Treatment in the early stages can 
include synovectomy and tendon reconstruction. In the later stages, when the 
joint is fixed or there is articular surface damage, a joint replacement or 
arthrodesis is necessary.
