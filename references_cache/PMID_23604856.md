Lynch Syndrome, or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is an 
autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by inactivating 
mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes. It accounts for 2-4 % of all incident 
colorectal cancers. Mutation carriers are at risk of early onset colorectal 
cancer, endometrial cancer, and a spectrum of other tumours. Accurate estimation 
of cancer risk for mutation carriers is essential for counselling, and 
establishing appropriate screening guidelines. This study reviews the current 
data on cancer risk, and emerging risk reduction strategies.
