BACKGROUND: Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare genetic disorder resulting from 
biallelic mutations in the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5) gene, 
which encodes the lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI). 
Although currently classified as a hyper-IgE syndrome, several manifestations 
contradict this categorization. Data on genotype-phenotype correlations remain 
limited, and pediatric outcomes of biologic therapies are inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the clinical, immunological features, 
genotype-phenotype correlations, and pediatric outcomes of various systemic and 
biologic therapies in detail.
METHODS: Clinical, immunological, and treatment data from 8 patients were 
collected in a mixed retrospective-prospective design. Variants were categorized 
based on the affected bioreactive fragments (FR1-FR5) of the LEKTI protein.
RESULTS: Among 6 SPINK5 variants, including 2 novel ones, 4 FR1-related variants 
were linked to severe phenotypes, whereas 2 FR5-related variants were associated 
with milder disease. The onset of skin features was significantly earlier in 
patients with allergic manifestations than in those without. Although no 
intrinsic developmental defects in T or B cells were identified, skin barrier 
disruption was associated with immune activation and skewing toward Th2/Th17 
responses. Notably, increased programmed cell death protein-1 expression, 
expansion of CD4+IL-17+ T cells, and reduced frequencies of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ 
T cells correlated with clinical disease severity. In scaly erythroderma, 
secukinumab was most effective for scaling, whereas dupilumab was more effective 
for pruritus. The efficacy of dupilumab and infliximab was temporary, with 
rebound skin lesions observed during follow-up. Immunoglobulin therapy supported 
growth but revealed variable skin benefits.
CONCLUSION: The described findings support the concept of indirect immune 
dysregulation in NS due to a defective skin barrier, emphasizing the need for 
therapies that extend beyond single cytokine or receptor blockade.
