Gastric cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, 
and infection with Helicobacter pylori and EBV, smoking and a salt-heavy diet 
have been shown to be risk factors for the development of gastric cancer. 
Currently, numerous research has demonstrated that differences in the structure 
of the gastric flora can be exploited to distinguish the different stages of 
gastric mucosal lesions and to predict the progression of gastric cancer. 
Therefore, a new biomarker is presented for the diagnosis of gastric cancer 
based on the structural differences of the gastric flora. Gastric flora has also 
potential in the treatment of gastric cancer. The application of non-H. pylori 
flora to modulate immune cells may increase the sensitivity of tumour cells for 
chemotherapy, improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and 
significantly prolong the survival of patients. This review of advances in the 
application of gastric flora in the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer is 
aimed at providing a reference and basis for future research in this field.

胃癌是全球癌症相关死亡的主要原因之一，幽门螺杆菌及EB病毒感染、吸烟、高盐饮食等已被证实为诱发胃癌的高危因素。目前，多项研究表明，可利用胃内菌群结构差异来区分胃黏膜病变的不同阶段，进而预测胃癌的发生和发展。因此有学者提出，可根据胃内菌群的结构的差异，作为胃癌诊断的新的生物学标志物。胃内菌群在胃癌的治疗中也同样表现出潜能，应用非幽门螺杆菌的菌群调节免疫细胞，可增加肿瘤细胞对化疗的敏感性，改善免疫检查点抑制剂的疗效，极大可能延长患者的生存期。本文综述了胃内菌群在胃癌的诊断与治疗方面的应用进展，旨在为今后该领域的研究提供参考和依据。.
