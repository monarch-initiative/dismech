Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains a major clinical problem, but treatments 
involving biologics have revolutionized its management. They target 
pathogenically relevant cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and immune cells 
such as B cells. In RA, biologics reduce joint inflammation, limit erosive 
damage, decrease disability, and improve quality of life. Infections are the 
main risk associated with their use. Because of the high prices of biologics, 
their cost-effectiveness is a matter of debate. They are mainly coadministered 
with disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate when the latter are found to 
achieve insufficient disease control on their own.
