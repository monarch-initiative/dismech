## Content

Abstract

Background and aims
Metformin has been reported to inhibit the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer (CRC) by mediating changes in intestinal flora. Studies have also indicated that the occurence of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) may also be associated with changes in the intestinal flora. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and safety of metformin in treating FAP and the association with intestinal flora.


Results

                      Compared with the baseline, the mean number and load of polyps in the areas of nanocarbon labeling and postoperative residuals in the test group were lower than those in the placebo group, while the diversity of intestinal flora species was increased. At the genus level, the relative abundance of
                      g_Ruminococcus
                      in the test group was lower than that at baseline, whereas the relative abundance of
                      g_Lactobacillus
                      was higher. These changes were statistically significant (
                      P
                       < 0.05).
                    


Conclusion
One-year metformin therapy for FAP is safe and effective, potentially mediated by modulating the intestinal flora. This study provides new insights and strategies for preventing adenomatous polyp carcinogenesis in FAP and explores possible preventive action.
