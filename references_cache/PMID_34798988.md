Lynch syndrome (LS) is a common form of inherited cancer susceptibility, which 
predisposes to colorectal cancer (CRC) along with a wide array of other 
extracolonic malignancies, including other gastrointestinal cancers, cancers of 
the gynecologic and genitourinary tracts, and other organ sites. Recent data 
have provided novel insights into patient-specific factors that can help 
clinicians understand an individual LS carrier's risk of extracolonic cancers, 
including sex, specific LS gene, age, family history of cancer, and other 
factors. This summary seeks to provide an update on extracolonic cancer risks in 
LS and provide recommendations for surveillance and risk reduction.
