Dengue fever (DF) has several hematological manifestations including 
thrombocytopenia and increased bleeding risk. Prophylactic platelet 
transfusion-in the absence of major bleeding-is utilized in DF with 
thrombocytopenia with the intention of preventing hemorrhagic complications. 
However, prophylactic platelet transfusion in DF is neither standardized nor 
supported by clinical evidence. We conclude that risks, costs and poor resource 
utilization associated with prophylactic platelet transfusion in DF far outweigh 
any potential hematological benefit, and as such, should not constitute routine 
clinical practice.
