Brain metastases secondary to primary non-small cell and small cell lung cancer 
have become an important area of research. The brain is one of the most common 
sites of failure following treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer, often as the only site. Treatment strategies and the outcome for brain 
metastases from lung cancer may differ from brain metastases arising from other 
primary cancers. This article reviews the prognostic factors associated with 
brain metastases from lung cancer, as well as current treatment approaches with 
chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy.
