INTRODUCTION: Jaccoud arthropathy (JA) is a nonerosive and deforming arthropathy 
experienced frequently by patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 
Although genetic polymorphisms are associated with SLE development, the 
association between genetic polymorphisms and JA has not been studied to date. 
The main objective of this study was to evaluate an association between HLA, 
STAT4, IRF5, and BLK polymorphisms and the presence of JA in Brazilian 
individuals with SLE.
METHODS: Patients were selected from a cohort of individuals with SLE followed 
at 2 rheumatology reference centers in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. The JA diagnosis 
was based on clinical and radiological criteria. The participants were genotyped 
for rs9271100, rs7574865, rs10488631, and rs13277113 polymorphisms in the HLA, 
STAT4, IRF5, and BLK genes, respectively, using real-time polymerase chain 
reaction. The presence of JA was correlated with allele frequencies, and 
clinical and laboratory data.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-four individuals with SLE (38 with JA and 106 with 
SLE without JA) were studied. The mean age of the patients was 45 ± 12 years; 
the majority were women and had brown skin. Patients with JA had a longer 
disease duration than patients without JA. Serositis and neuropsychiatric 
manifestations were more frequent in the JA population. The A allele of 
rs13277113 in the BLK gene was associated with the presence of JA.
CONCLUSIONS: The rs13277113 polymorphism in the BLK gene was found to be a 
possible genetic risk for JA development. However, further studies in larger 
populations should be performed to confirm this finding.
