Dengue infection is a major cause of morbidity in tropical and subtropical 
regions, bringing nearly 40% of the world population at risk and causing more 
than 20,000 deaths per year. But there is neither a vaccine for dengue disease 
nor antiviral drugs to treat the infection. In recent years, dengue infection 
has been particularly prevalent in India, Southeast Asia, Brazil, and Guangdong 
Province, China. In this article, we present a brief summary of the biological 
characteristics of dengue virus and associated flaviviruses, and outline the 
progress on studies of vaccines and drugs based on potential targets of the 
dengue virus.
