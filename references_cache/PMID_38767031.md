Retrograde upper esophageal sphincter dysfunction (R-UESD) is characterized by 
the inability to belch. Evidence of using high-resolution manometry (HRM) in 
diagnosing R-UESD has emerged in recent years. We describe the clinical picture 
and HRM patterns of two patients with R-UESD. Case 1: A 23-year-old female 
presented with a two-year complaint of inability to belch. We performed HRM with 
a belch provocation test for which the patient drank 500 ml of carbonated water. 
The study revealed increased esophageal pressure, an absence of UES relaxation 
and secondary peristalsis once the patient mentioned the need to belch. Case 2: 
A 21-year-old male presented to our medical office with a history of an 
incapacity to belch during the last three years. We performed HRM with a belch 
provocation test. During the study, he reported an incapacity to belch and his 
symptoms coincided with increased esophageal pressure, an absence of UES 
relaxation, and secondary peristalsis. Retrograde upper esophageal sphincter 
dysfunction is a rare condition characterized by a lack of UES relaxation during 
esophageal distension. The incapacity to belch is the hallmark of the disease. 
We encourage the use of HRM, looking for an increase in esophageal pressure to 
the level of gastric pressure, failure of UES relaxation with consequently no 
venting of air across the UES, and secondary peristalsis. In conclusion, diverse 
R-UESD clinical presentations represent a diagnostic challenge for physicians. 
This case series highlights the need to actively search for typical HRM findings 
when encountering patients referring an incapacity to belch.
