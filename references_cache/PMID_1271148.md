Transient neonatal pustular melanosis.

Ramamurthy RS, Reveri M, Esterly NB, Fretzin DF, Pildes RS.

Newborn infants were observed with vesicopustular and pigmented macular skin 
lesions, which occurred more commonly in black and mature infants and which were 
distinct clinically and histopathologically from erythema toxicum. 
Histopathology of skin biopsies of the vesicopustules is characterized by 
polymorphonuclear infiltration. The lesions often present as, or evolve into, a 
pigmented macule and persist from three weeks to three months. There are no 
associated systemic symptoms.
