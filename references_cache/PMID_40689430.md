This review addresses the genetics of acne vulgaris, the most common skin 
disease. It is characterized by the presence of comedones (blackheads), papules, 
and pustules. The condition is associated with sebaceous glands in the face and 
chest, which produce an oily substance called sebum. In developed nations, acne 
affects over 80% of adolescents. Mild disease usually resolves spontaneously. 
More severe acne can leave permanent, disfiguring scarring and strongly affects 
quality of life. In those cases, medical intervention is warranted. To date, 
antibiotics and retinoids (synthetic vitamin A derivatives) are the mainstays of 
treatment. Depending on the severity of the condition, these drugs may be 
administered either topically or systemically. Whilst generally effective, they 
do come with significant drawbacks. Antibiotic use for treating acne is 
contributing to antimicrobial resistance. In addition, indiscriminate 
eradication of the skin microbiome negatively impacts skin health. Retinoids are 
teratogenic and have other undesirable side effects, such as skin irritation and 
increased UV sensitivity. Thus, there is a clear need for effective 
interventions that target the underlying disease mechanism, minimizing side 
effects. Rapid progress has recently been made in understanding the mechanisms 
underlying acne. For decades, it was assumed that blackhead formation results 
from the accumulation of sebum in the hair follicle opening, due to increased 
sebum production at the onset of puberty. Subsequent colonization by the 
commensal bacterium Cutibacterium acnes then was thought to cause inflammation. 
It was also postulated that this micro-organism could induce blackheads. There 
are, however, several problems with this supposed sequence of events, not the 
least of which is that it doesn't explain how retinoids work, or why sebaceous 
glands associated with blackheads are atrophic and hence produce less sebum, not 
more. Both GWAS and single gene disorders unequivocally indicate stem/progenitor 
cell maintenance and cellular migration as the most important processes in the 
pathogenesis of acne. Together with insights from mouse models, this new 
perspective is transforming the way we think about acne and its treatment.
