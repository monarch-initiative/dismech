BACKGROUND: Mental symptoms such as fatigue, concentration difficulties, and 
sleep disorders are frequently reported in both Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) and 
Post-COVID-19 Vaccination Syndrome (PCVS). Although symptom profiles may 
overlap, comparative epidemiological data from the general population are 
limited.
METHODS: We conducted a representative online survey of 4,632 adults in Germany 
and investigated mental symptoms associated with PCS and PCVS, including 
fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disturbances, impaired performance and 
depressed mood. Socio-demographic factors, vaccination status, vaccine type and 
number of vaccinations were analysed.
RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported mental symptoms of PCS was 12.1% among 
respondents, with women and younger individuals more commonly affected. The 
prevalence of self-reported PCVS was 12.6% among vaccinated individuals, with no 
significant gender differences, but fewer cognitive symptoms in older adults. 
Respondents with only one vaccination reported the highest rate of PCVS symptoms 
(20.8%), which decreased to 8.9% for those with four or more vaccinations. 
Differences between vaccine types were small overall, but non-mRNA vaccines were 
associated with a slightly higher rate of sleep and concentration problems.
CONCLUSION: Mental symptoms are relatively common after both SARS-CoV-2 
infection and vaccination and show overlap, especially fatigue. These findings 
highlight how difficult it is to distinguish PCS from PCVS and emphasize the 
need to consider alternative explanations, such as undiagnosed depressive 
disorders, in clinical assessments.
