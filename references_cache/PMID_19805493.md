Cannabinoid-derived drugs are promising agents for the development of novel 
neuroprotective strategies. Activation of neuronal CB(1) cannabinoid receptors 
attenuates excitotoxic glutamatergic neurotransmission, triggers prosurvival 
signalling pathways and palliates motor symptoms in animal models of 
neurodegenerative disorders. However, in Huntington's disease there is a very 
early downregulation of CB(1) receptors in striatal neurons that, together with 
the undesirable psychoactive effects triggered by CB(1) receptor activation, 
foster the search for alternative pharmacological treatments. Here, we show that 
CB(2) cannabinoid receptor expression increases in striatal microglia of 
Huntington's disease transgenic mouse models and patients. Genetic ablation of 
CB(2) receptors in R6/2 mice, that express human mutant huntingtin exon 1, 
enhanced microglial activation, aggravated disease symptomatology and reduced 
mice lifespan. Likewise, induction of striatal excitotoxicity in CB(2) 
receptor-deficient mice by quinolinic acid administration exacerbated brain 
oedema, microglial activation, proinflammatory-mediator state and medium-sized 
spiny neuron degeneration. Moreover, administration of CB(2) receptor-selective 
agonists to wild-type mice subjected to excitotoxicity reduced 
neuroinflammation, brain oedema, striatal neuronal loss and motor symptoms. 
Studies on ganciclovir-induced depletion of astroglial proliferation in 
transgenic mice expressing thymidine kinase under the control of the glial 
fibrillary acidic protein promoter excluded the participation of proliferating 
astroglia in CB(2) receptor-mediated actions. These findings support a pivotal 
role for CB(2) receptors in attenuating microglial activation and preventing 
neurodegeneration that may pave the way to new therapeutic strategies for 
neuroprotection in Huntington's disease as well as in other neurodegenerative 
disorders with a significant excitotoxic component.
