INTRODUCTION: The purpose was to explore the correlation between refeeding 
hypophosphatemia and delirium and analyze the related factors in critically ill 
patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of critically ill patients admitted 
to Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital between September 2019 and March 2021. The 
patients were divided into delirium and nondelirium groups. Demographic data, 
underlying diseases, laboratory findings, comorbidities, nutritional intake and 
overall prognosis were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 162 patients were included and divided into delirium (n=54) 
and nondelirium (n=108) groups. Serum phosphorus levels in the two groups 
decreased significantly in the first three days (P1, P2, P3) after nutrient 
intake compared with baseline before nutrient intake (Ppre). P1 and P2 were 
significantly lower in the delirium group compared to the nondelirium group. The 
maximum blood phosphorus reduction (Pmax) in the first three days after nutrient 
intake was significantly higher in the delirium group than in the nondelirium 
group. The time of Pmax in the delirium group was on the first day after 
nutrient intake. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified starting 
route of nutrition and P1< 0.845 mmol/L as the independent predictors of 
delirium development in critically ill patients.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of delirium in critically ill patients is high and 
associated with refeeding hypophosphatemia. Delirium may occur with serum 
phosphorus levels less than 0.845 mmol/L on the first day.
