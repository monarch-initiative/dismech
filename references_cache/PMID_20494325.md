The hypothesis that adequate vitamin D nutrition can contribute to the 
prevention of multiple sclerosis (MS) was originally proposed to explain the 
geographical distribution of MS, but only recently has the relation between 
various measures of vitamin D (eg, sun exposure, dietary sources, and serum 
concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) and risk of developing MS been rigorously 
investigated. Overall, the results of these studies support a protective effect 
of vitamin D, but there are uncertainties and many unanswered questions, 
including how vitamin D exerts a protective effect, how genetic variations 
modify the effect, and whether vitamin D can influence the course of MS 
progression.
