Lysosomal free sialic acid storage disorder (FSASD) is a rare neurodegenerative 
disease caused by biallelic mutations in SLC17A5, encoding the lysosomal sialic 
acid exporter, SLC17A5 (sialin). While the involvement of oligodendroglia in 
FSASD pathogenesis is established, the roles of other neural cell types remain 
elusive. In this study, we utilized radial glial cells (iRGCs), immature and 
mature astrocytes (iIAs and iMAs, respectively), and cortical neurons (iCNs) 
differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from two 
individuals with FSASD, alongside two independent healthy donors for comparison. 
We employed a multifaceted profiling approach, including the assessment of 
cellular glycosphingolipids (GSLs), transcriptomics focused on GSL metabolism 
genes, and 4-methylumbelliferone-based lysosomal enzyme activity measurements. 
Our findings revealed significant elevations in free sialic acid levels across 
all FSASD cell types, indicating that iPSCs and derived iRGCs, iIAs, iMAs and 
iCNs may be used to model FSASD in vitro. We observed significant alterations in 
the abundance of specific GSL species, predominantly in mature astrocytes, with 
fewer changes in other cell types. Transcriptomic analyses uncovered 
differential expression of genes involved in GSL catabolism, including those 
encoding glycohydrolases. Enzyme assays corroborated the transcriptomic 
findings, showing heightened glycohydrolase activities, particularly in mature 
astrocytes. Collectively, these data may help refine our understanding of neural 
cell phenotypes and potential contributors to selective vulnerability in FSASD.
