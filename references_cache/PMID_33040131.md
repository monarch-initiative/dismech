Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder. Clinical 
presentation of this rare condition may affect locomotive, neurological, 
cardio-vascular, endocrine and metabolic systems. Other noticeable features of 
the disorder are vision loss, obesity, polydactyly, kidney failure, hypogonadism 
and slow mental processing. We present the case of a Bardet-Biedl syndrome that 
appeared in the emergency room with seizures due to hypocalcaemia. Because of 
unusual body habitus and involvement of multiple body organ systems, a genetic 
diagnosis was sought. A web-based search was prompted as a resource to figure 
out rare clinical syndrome like BBS, and its further management particularly 
genetic counselling.
