Primary cilia are essential cellular organelles with pivotal roles in many 
signalling pathways. Here we provide an overview of the role of primary cilia 
within the kidney, starting with primary ciliary structure and key protein 
complexes. We then highlight the specialised functions of primary cilia, 
emphasising their role in a group of diseases known as renal ciliopathies. These 
conditions include forms of polycystic kidney disease, nephronophthisis, and 
other syndromic ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome and Bardet-Biedl 
syndrome. We explore models of renal ciliopathies, both in vitro and in vivo, 
shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases including 
Wnt and Hedgehog signalling pathways, inflammation, and cellular metabolism. 
Finally, we discuss therapeutic approaches, from current treatments to 
cutting-edge preclinical research and clinical trials.
