In countries such as India, the silver jewelry industry is an important cottage 
industry. Silver is mixed with cadmium and then used to make silver jewelry. 
During this process there is a formation of cadmium fumes, and the workers 
inhale the fumes. Cadmium is a neurotoxic and nephrotoxic heavy metal, and there 
are no national policies to prevent exposure to such chemicals. We will present 
a case of cadmium induced peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, and decreased bone 
density.
