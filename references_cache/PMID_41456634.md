Malnutrition-Related Diabetes Mellitus (MRDM) is a subtype of diabetes 
associated with chronic malnutrition, primarily observed in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) and impoverished populations. The disease is 
characterized by onset in young, lean patients with a history of chronic 
undernutrition, insulin deficiency, persistent insulin sensitivity, and 
resistance to ketosis. MRDM was recognized by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) in 1985, then removed from classification in 1999 due to a lack of 
evidence. Emerging evidence has revealed a unique pathophysiology, prompting the 
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) to officially recognize MRDM as "Type 5 
Diabetes" (T5D). This review synthesizes the evidence that validates T5D as a 
distinct endotype, which is mechanistically different from other diabetes types. 
It delineates the epidemiological patterns of T5D and focuses on the 
pathophysiological "blueprint" of the malnourished pancreas. It also integrates 
evidence showing how early-life nutritional deprivation, including protein and 
micronutrient deficiencies, programmatically reduces β-cell mass and function 
through mechanisms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum 
stress, oxidative damage, and persistent epigenetic modifications. Current 
management strategies and the distinct profile of long-term complications are 
highlighted. Finally, the review outlines pressing future directions, arguing 
that the formal recognition of T5D provides an opportunity for coordinated 
research and policy initiatives that address the root causes and consequences of 
this diabetes of poverty.
