Meckel's diverticulum.

DeBartolo HM Jr, van Heerden JA.

One hundred and ninety surgically documented cases of Meckel's diverticulum 
encountered at the Mayo Clinic during a 51-year period, 1920 through 1971, are 
reviewed. In 39 patients, the diverticulum was left undisturbed. In 51 patients, 
the diverticulum was the primary surgical disease, and, in 100 patients, the 
diverticulum was removed incidentally. The clinical features are presented as 
well as the surgical considerations. Meckel's diverticulum is a relatively 
frequent development anomaly with eccentric manifestations, and its surgical 
management has intrigued physicians for over 350 years. Dr. Charles W. Mayo 
stated, "Meckel's diverticulum is frequently suspected, often looked for, and 
seldom found."
