Association studies have greatly refined the important role of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). However, the effects of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms on AIH are not well established. The aim of this study was to systematically characterise the association of MHC variants with AIH in their well-defined cohort of patients. In this study, a total of 1,622 patients with AIH type 1 and 10,466 geographically and ethnically matched healthy individuals from 15 clinical centres in China were enrolled. A total of 588 HLA variants were significantly associated with AIH. Stepwise conditional analysis revealed the strongest allele was in the HLA-B gene (HLA-B*35:01, p = 8.17×10-304; OR = 7.32), with additional independent signals at HLA-B*08:01 (p = 1.35 × 10-33; OR = 4.26) and rs7765379 (p = 5.08 × 10-18; OR = 1.66). Fine-mapping analysis further identified position 67 where phenylalanine of the HLA-B molecule was significantly associated with AIH (p = 3.39×10-139), at the peptide binding groove. A strong link between the lead HLA variant and clinical phenotypes of AIH was observed: patients with HLA-B*35:01 were less frequently positive for ANA and tended to have higher serum AST and ALT levels at diagnosis, but lower serum IgG levels. The findings illustrate the value of the MHC region in AIH and provide a new perspective for the immunogenetics of AIH.
