Pre-type I diabetes. Linear loss of beta cell response to intravenous glucose.

Srikanta S, Ganda OP, Gleason RE, Jackson RA, Soeldner JS, Eisenbarth GS.

Twenty-one intravenous (i.v.) glucose tolerance tests were performed on nine 
subjects before the onset of overt type I diabetes mellitus. Islet cell 
antibodies (6 of 9 subjects) and elevated levels of Ia-positive T-lymphocytes (3 
of 3 subjects studied) were detected during the prediabetic period. Elevations 
of fasting blood glucose and peak glucose during oral glucose tolerance tests 
were not observed until the year before onset of clinically overt diabetes. 
During the prediabetic period, there was a progressive loss of early-phase 
insulin release to i.v. glucose (rate of decline, 20-40 microU/ml insulin 
release/yr; correlation coefficient, 0.9).
