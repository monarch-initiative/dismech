Dengue fever is an endemic mosquito-borne viral infection in many tropical and 
subtropical regions. While its common manifestations include high-grade fever, 
rash, and myalgia, cardiac complications, particularly complete heart block, are 
rare but potentially life-threatening, underscoring the importance of vigilance. 
A 53-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with 
dizziness, weakness, and a five-day history of high-grade fever with chills. He 
lived in a dengue-endemic area and denied any recent travel. Physical 
examination revealed bradyarrhythmia (38-49 beats per minute) and hypotension 
(99/72 millimeters of mercury). Laboratory tests confirmed acute dengue 
infection. Despite supportive care and temporary pacing, the patient's intrinsic 
atrioventricular conduction showed no recovery, leading to persistent pacemaker 
dependence. On hospital day 17, a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker was 
implanted. He stabilized after the procedure and was discharged with close 
follow-up. The diagnosis of dengue was established using standard clinical 
criteria, confirmed by serologies for immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G and 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Comprehensive investigations 
excluded other bradyarrhythmia causes, such as Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, and 
myocarditis, supporting dengue as the sole etiology. This case highlights the 
rare but significant phenomenon of dengue-induced complete heart block, 
emphasizing that long-term pacemaker support may be necessary if conduction 
fails to recover. By adding to the limited data on dengue-associated advanced 
conduction disturbances, this case underscores the need for early recognition 
and multidisciplinary management to improve outcomes.
