Functional decline for each decade at symptom onset and need for cane, walker, 
or wheelchair were assessed in 78 biopsy-proved patients with sporadic inclusion 
body myositis. Patients with disease onset between 40 and 59 years used a walker 
after 10.2 +/- 5.8 years, whereas those with disease onset between 60 and 79 
years used a walker after 5.7 +/- 5.0 years (p = 0.05). Because patients 
progress faster to disability when symptoms begin after the age of 60, age at 
disease onset may define patient subsets for stratification in clinical trials.
