Seizures induced by photic (or visual) stimuli or photosensitive seizures can be 
observed in generalized or focal, idiopathic, or symptomatic epilepsies, in 
progressive neurodegenerative disorders, and even in the context of 
situation-related (acute symptomatic) seizures. In addition to this 
"transversal" presence of the photosensitive trait across various epilepsy types 
and diseases, some syndromes in which all, or almost all, seizures are induced 
by photic stimuli seem to have sufficient specificity and may be considered as 
syndromes of pure reflex photosensitive epilepsy. Here we review the clinical 
characteristic of the different types of photic-induced seizures and the main 
epileptic syndromes that are characterized by visual sensitivity either as the 
sole manifestation or as an accessory feature.
