Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type IV is the most severe form of EDS. In 
many cases the disease is caused by a point mutation of Gly in type III 
collagen. A slower folding of the collagen helix is a potential cause for 
over-modifications. However, little is known about the rate of folding of type 
III collagen in patients with EDS. To understand the molecular mechanism of the 
effect of mutations, a system was developed for bacterial production of 
homotrimeric model polypeptides. The C-terminal quarter, 252 residues, of the 
natural human type III collagen was attached to (GPP)7 with the type XIX 
collagen trimerization domain (NC2). The natural collagen domain forms a triple 
helical structure without 4-hydroxylation of proline at a low temperature. At 33 
°C, the natural collagenous part is denatured, but the C-terminal (GPP)7-NC2 
remains intact. Switching to a low temperature triggers the folding of the type 
III collagen domain in a zipper-like fashion that resembles the natural process. 
We used this system for the two known EDS mutations (Gly-to-Val) in the middle 
at Gly-910 and at the C terminus at Gly-1018. In addition, wild-type and 
Gly-to-Ala mutants were made. The mutations significantly slow down the overall 
rate of triple helix formation. The effect of the Gly-to-Val mutation is much 
more severe compared with Gly-to-Ala. This is the first report on the folding of 
collagen with EDS mutations, which demonstrates local delays in the triple helix 
propagation around the mutated residue.
