Metastatic and localized mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors are exquisitely 
sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The ability of ICB to prevent 
dMMR malignant or pre-malignant neoplasia development in patients with Lynch 
syndrome (LS) is unknown. Of 172 cancer-affected patients with LS who had 
received ≥1 ICB cycles, 21 (12%) developed subsequent malignancies after ICB 
exposure, 91% (29/32) of which were dMMR, with median time to development of 
21 months (interquartile range, 6-38). Twenty-four of 61 (39%) ICB-treated 
patients who subsequently underwent surveillance colonoscopy had premalignant 
polyps. Within matched pre-ICB and post-ICB follow-up periods, the overall rate 
of tumor development was unchanged; however, on subgroup analysis, a decreased 
incidence of post-ICB visceral tumors was observed. These data suggest that ICB 
treatment of LS-associated tumors does not eliminate risk of new neoplasia 
development, and LS-specific surveillance strategies should continue. These data 
have implications for immunopreventative strategies and provide insight into the 
immunobiology of dMMR tumors.
