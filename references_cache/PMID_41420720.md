BACKGROUND: The phenotype of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease 
(ARPKD) can be quite variable: some patients progress to end-stage kidney 
disease (ESKD) in infancy, while others may not require kidney replacement 
therapy (KRT) until later childhood or adolescence. This study aimed to evaluate 
clinical, biochemical, imaging, and genetic findings that may influence kidney 
prognosis in pediatric patients with ARPKD.
METHODS: The patients diagnosed before birth or in the first month were 
classified as perinatal presenters and later than 1 month as non-perinatal 
presenters. Additionally, groups were formed based on estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) at the last visit and variant types.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients (8 male, 9 female) were enrolled in the study. 
Kidney survival rates at 5 years was 71.4% in the perinatal group, whereas it 
was 100% in the non-perinatal group. The early height-adjusted kidney dimension 
(haKD) was positively correlated with perinatal presentation and antenatal 
diagnosis. At the last follow-up, the mean eGFR was significantly lower in the 
truncating group with four patients (23.5%) progressing to stage-5 chronic 
kidney disease (CKD).
CONCLUSIONS: The kidney survival rate is lower in patients with early 
presentation. Initial low eGFR and severe variants are important predictors of 
kidney survival. Additionally, early high haKD may be associated with poor 
kidney outcome. Further studies with larger patient populations and long-term 
follow-up are necessary to better understand the prognosis of pediatric patients 
with ARPKD.
