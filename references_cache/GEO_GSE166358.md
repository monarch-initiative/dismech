# Arid1a-Plagl1-Hh signaling is indispensable for differentiation-associated cell cycle arrest of tooth root progenitors [RNA-Seq]

## Content

We show that loss of Arid1a impairs the differentiation-associated cell cycle arrest of tooth root progenitors through Hh signaling regulation, leading to shortened roots. Our data suggest that Plagl1, as a cofactor, endows Arid1a with its cell type/spatial functional specificity.
