As part of its commitment to empowering people to make informed consumer 
decisions, the Consumers' Association investigates the convenience aspects of a 
vast range of products, from cars to garden spades. Evaluation approaches 
include user trials, convenience checklists and expert appraisals. Our 
methodology is subject to constant review and refinement to ensure the highest 
levels of reliability, validity and auditability. We have a distinctive 
approach: our tests are designed to reflect consumer usage and to provide 
comparative data which is absolutely fair to all products. This paper discusses 
the evolving nature of that methodology within the "lifetime" of a product. 
Reasons for choosing each method are given as practical guidance for those 
involved in comparative testing.
