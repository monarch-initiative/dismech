Schizophrenia is associated with enormous morbidity, mortality, personal 
disability, and social cost. Although considerable research on schizophrenia has 
been performed, the etiology of this disease has not been fully elucidated. In 
recent years, imaging and genetic technologies have been developed dramatically. 
Disturbances in glutamate and GABAergic neurotransmission may underlie the 
pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We attempted an integrative review, of studies 
pertaining to recent advances of schizophrenia research with a focus on 
neuroimaging and genetic studies. Additionally, we present the preliminary 
findings of the clinical research in our outpatient unit, specialized for early 
intervention, at the University of Tokyo Hospital.
