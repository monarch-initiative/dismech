Lyme disease is an expanding community health issue in the United States. This 
has led to greater public awareness in Canada, although the disease remains rare 
here. We review the biology of ticks and show how feeding patterns are relevant 
to disease transmission. Diagnosing Lyme disease is sometimes problematic, but 
treatment can be effective, particularly in the early stages. Preventive 
measures are aimed at avoiding tick contact and early tick removal.
