Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease causing significant health and economic 
burdens globally. The dengue virus (DENV) comprises four serotypes (DENV1-4). 
Usually, the primary infection is asymptomatic or causes mild dengue fever (DF), 
while secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk of severe 
dengue disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF). Complement system activation 
induces inflammation and tissue injury, contributing to disease pathogenesis. 
However, in asymptomatic or primary infections, protective immunity largely 
results from the complement system's lectin pathway (LP), which is activated 
through foreign glycan recognition. Differences in N-glycans displayed on the 
DENV envelope membrane influence the lectin pattern recognition receptor (PRR) 
binding efficiency. The important PRR, mannan binding lectin (MBL), mediates 
DENV neutralization through (1) a complement activation-independent mechanism 
via direct MBL glycan recognition, thereby inhibiting DENV attachment to host 
target cells, or (2) a complement activation-dependent mechanism following the 
attachment of complement opsonins C3b and C4b to virion surfaces. The serum 
concentrations of lectin PRRs and their polymorphisms influence these LP 
activities. Conversely, to escape the LP attack and enhance the infectivity, 
DENV utilizes the secreted form of nonstructural protein 1 (sNS1) to counteract 
the MBL effects, thereby increasing viral survival and dissemination.
