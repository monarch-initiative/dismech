Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of sphingolipid metabolism, 
caused by enzyme hexosaminidase A deficiency that leads to an accumulation of 
GM2 in neurocytes which results in progressive loss of neurological function. 
The accumulation of lipid in retinal ganglion cells that leads to a chalk-white 
appearance of the fundus called 'cherry red spot' is the hallmark of Tay-Sachs 
disease. It is also seen in others neurometabolic diseases as well as in central 
retinal artery occlusion. This case reports a child with Tay-Sachs disease in a 
family with four previous similar deaths without diagnostic.
