Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare, severe, and often life-threatening disease 
for which current therapeutic approaches are limited and show variable 
effectiveness. NS is characterized by excessive epidermal desquamation that 
results in a highly defective epidermal barrier, constitutive skin inflammation, 
allergies, and hair abnormalities. NS develops due to loss-of-function mutations 
in the SPINK5 gene, which encodes the LEKTI inhibitor that regulates KLK 
proteases (KLK5, KLK6, KLK7, KLK13, and KLK14). These findings indicate that 
dysregulation of proteolytic networks underlies the extensive skin shedding and 
inflammation characteristic of NS. Spink5-/- mice recapitulate the major 
features of the human disease but exhibit neonatal lethality. Several double- 
and triple-knockout models have been generated to rescue the lethal NS 
phenotype, and have proved instrumental in studies aiming to elucidate the 
biological pathways involved in NS, and to identify and validate potential 
targets for drug development. These studies have established that inhibition of 
excessive KLK protease activity in LEKTI-deficient epidermis can reverse the 
cutaneous manifestations of NS. In particular, ablation of KLK5 results in a 
marked therapeutic response, although KLK7 or TNFα must also be inhibited to 
rescue the most severe (lethal) form of NS. Murine models have also been 
essential in proving or disproving putative pathways and/or therapeutic targets 
proposed from in vitro studies or patient case studies. Collectively, these 
models have provided a deeper understanding of the epidermal proteolytic 
cascades involved in NS pathology and in normal skin renewal. Moreover, these 
models offer a platform in which disease-specific candidate therapeutics can be 
tested and preclinically validated. © 2026 The Author(s). The Journal of
