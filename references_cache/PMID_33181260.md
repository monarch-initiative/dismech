Alterations in regulatory T (Treg) cells have been observed in generalized 
vitiligo (GV) patients and decreased Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3) has been implicated 
in the disease pathogenesis. The present study examined FOXP3 rs3761547(A > G), 
rs3761548(C > A), rs2232365(A > G) and GAGE10 rs11798415(A > T) promoter single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 419 GV patients and 429 controls from Gujarat 
population using PCR-RFLP and ARMS-PCR. Real-time PCR and flow cytometry were 
used for assessment of FOXP3 mRNA and protein levels respectively in 96 GV 
patients and 90 controls. The frequency of genotypes (p < 0.001) and alleles 
(p = 0.012 & p = 0.040) for rs3761547(A > G) and rs11798415(A > T) SNPs 
significantly differed between GV patients and controls. FOXP3 mRNA and protein 
levels were significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in GV Tregs compared to 
controls. Active vitiligo (AV) Tregs showed significantly reduced FOXP3 mRNA and 
protein levels compared to that of stable vitiligo (SV) (p = 0.02 & p = 0.039). 
The correlation of genotype-phenotype of FOXP3 SNPs suggested reduced FOXP3 mRNA 
(p = 0.019, p < 0.001 & p < 0.001) and protein (p = 0.028, p < 0.001 & 
p = 0.022) levels in patients with susceptible GG, AA and GG genotypes 
respectively. The GAGT, GCGT & ACGT haplotypes were prevalent in GV patients 
(p = 0.004, p = 0.004 & p = 0.016); however, GAGT & GCGT were overrepresented in 
patients with AV (p = 0.044 & p = 0.024). The susceptible GAGT and GCGT 
haplotypes in patients exhibited reduction in FOXP3 mRNA (p = 0.014 & p = 0.019) 
and protein (p = 0.024 & p = 0.028). DNA-protein docking analysis revealed 
reduced binding for transcription factor C/EBP to the susceptible allele 'G' 
(rs3761547) compared to A allele. For the first time, the study suggests 
significant association of FOXP3 rs3761547(A > G) & GAGE10 rs11798415(A > T) 
SNPs with susceptibility to GV in Gujarat population. In addition, the likely 
role of these SNPs in altered FOXP3 expression of Tregs may possibly affect Treg 
suppressive function in GV.
