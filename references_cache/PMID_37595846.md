Risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult patients with atopic dermatitis.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease. This study evaluated the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adult AD patients compared with age- and sex-matched controls. We used the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort 2.0 (NHIS-NSC 2.0) from 2002 to 2015. Adult patients (aged 20 years or older) with AD (n = 37,770) and controls (n = 188,850) were selected. Among the AD patients, subgroup analyses were performed by grading the severity of AD and use of systemic corticosteroids. The risk of T2DM in the adult AD group was significantly higher than in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.27-1.63, P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis of AD patients, severe AD was significantly associated with risk of T2DM (adjusted hazard ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.88, P = 0.012). In AD patients who used systemic corticosteroids, the risk of T2DM was higher than in AD patients without systemic corticosteroid use (adjusted hazard ratio 1.81, 95% confidence interval 1.28-2.57, P < 0.001).
