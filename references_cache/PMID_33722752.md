It is now widely accepted that antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) have direct 
pathogenic effects and that B cells, notably through aPL production, play a key 
role in the development of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Recent findings 
strengthened the implication of B cells with the description of specific B cell 
phenotype abnormalities and inborn errors of immunity involving B cell signaling 
in APS patients. In addition, it has been shown in preclinical models that 
cross-reactivity between APS autoantigens and mimotopes expressed by human gut 
commensals can lead to B cell tolerance breakdown and are sufficient for APS 
development. However, B cell targeting therapies are surprisingly not as 
effective as expected in APS compared to other autoimmune diseases. Elucidation 
of the B cell tolerance breakdown mechanisms in APS patients may help to develop 
and guide the use of novel therapeutic agents that target B cells or specific 
immune pathway.
