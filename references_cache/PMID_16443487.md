Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the processes of the 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) cascade, laying the groundwork for improvements in 
diagnosis and treatment. Advancement has been made in understanding the genetic 
basis of AD, with identification of causative genes for early-onset familial AD, 
and the role of the polymorphism of the APOE gene in the late-onset form of the 
disease. Understanding cerebral degeneration and accumulation of beta-amyloid 
has generated hopes for discovery of disease-modifying treatments. Progress is 
needed in understanding the mechanisms that link beta-amyloid accumulation and 
neuronal death. The next 5 years will be crucial in this respect.
