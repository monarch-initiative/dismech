Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the association of antiphospholipid 
antibodies with thromboses and/or obstetric morbidity. Obstetric morbidity 
includes recurrent first trimester loss, stillbirth, intrauterine death, 
preeclam-psia, premature birth and fetal growth restriction. Although current 
treatment regimens including aspirin and low-molecular weight heparin have 
improved pregnancy outcomes, 30% of affected women have pregnancy 
complica-tions. Women with APS are therefore high-risk pregnancies who should be 
monitored in specialist centres according to international standards.
