PURPOSE: Human leukocyte antigen-A29 (HLA-A29) birdshot retinochoroiditis (BRC) 
is a noninfectious uveitis affecting independently the retina and the choroid. 
While the choroidal involvement is characterized by a stromal choroiditis, the 
retinal features of BRC were less well defined until a recent study determined a 
specific pattern of retinal involvement with seven features including profuse 
posterior retinal leakage, thick fluorescein angiography sheathing/staining, 
profuse disc hyperfluorescence, macular edema with foveal sparing, and 
circulatory arteriovenous pseudo delay. The aim of this study was to determine 
whether the specific pattern of retinal involvement was diagnostic for BRC 
distinguishing it from other causes of retinal vasculitis.
METHODS: A retrospective comparative study comparing patients diagnosed with BRC 
to patients with other causes of retinal vasculitis. A score based on seven 
retinal features was calculated. The maximum possible score was 16. If the score 
reached ≥ 9, the vasculitis was considered to be compatible with BRC.
RESULTS: Eighteen BRC and 18 non-BRC vasculitis were included in the study. The 
mean age of BRC patients was 49.5 ± 9.1 years, 11/18 females and 7/18 males 
(female 61%/male 39%). HLA-A29 antigen was present in all patients (100%). The 
mean age of patients in the control group with non-BRC vasculitis was 37 ± 17, 
11/18 females and 7/18 males (female 61%/male 39%). The control group included 
nine cases of sarcoidosis chorioretinitis, six cases of intermediate uveitis of 
the pars planitis type, two cases of Behçet uveitis, and one case of 
tuberculosis chorioretinitis. The mean scores for the BRC group were 10.5 ± 1.7, 
while in the control group, it was 3.9 ± 2.8 (P < 0.0001, t-test). Using 
Fisher's exact test, the probability of the scores ≥ 9 to correspond to BRC was 
significantly different and higher than the scores of the group of non-BRC 
vasculitis (P < 0.0001). The positive predictive value was high amounting to 
88.9%.
CONCLUSION: Retinal vasculitis related to BRC has specific findings leading, if 
present, to the diagnosis of BRC that should be ascertained by the search of 
indocyanine green angiography lesions with the ultimate confirmation by the 
presence of the HLA-A29 antigen.
