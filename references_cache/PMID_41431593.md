Polycystic echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by cestodes of 
Echinococcus vogeli, which occurs in rural and wild areas of Central and South 
America. Its definitive hosts are Speothos venaticus (bush dog) and Canis 
familiaris (domestic dog), while Cuniculus paca (paca) serves as the 
intermediate host. Humans become accidental hosts by consuming food or water 
contaminated with eggs of this helminth. In the Amazon, due to geographic, 
economic, and cultural factors, rural populations often consume wild meat as a 
main protein source. The viscera of pacas are used to feed domestic dogs, 
perpetuating the life cycle of E. vogeli. We describe a rural patient with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and neotropical echinococcosis who 
developed a hepatic abscess that fistulized into the right hemithorax. Due to 
the low hepatic reserve and extensive liver involvement, the conventional 
surgical approach for echinococcosis was contraindicated.
