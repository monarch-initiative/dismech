Fabry disease is a frequent lysosomal storage disorder secondary to the 
deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. This X-linked genetic disease 
realizes progressive and systemic manifestations that affect both male and 
female. Fabry disease may present as "classical", as "late-onset" or 
"non-classical" forms. Symptoms and organ involvements of classical Fabry 
disease are acral pain crisis, cornea verticillata, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 
stroke and chronic kidney disease with proteinuria. Other common symptoms are 
often poorly recognized, such as gastrointestinal or ear involvements. In 
classical Fabry disease, symptoms first appear during childhood or during 
teenage years in males, but later in females. Patients with non-classical or 
late-onset Fabry disease have delayed manifestations or a single-organ 
involvement. Diagnosis is therefore difficult when classical organ involvements 
are missing, in paucisymptomatic patients or in late-onset forms. Recognition of 
Fabry disease is important because effective treatments are available. They have 
to be prescribed early. In male, diagnosis is made with alpha-galactosidase A 
enzyme activity dosage in leukocyte, that is very low or null in classical forms 
and under 30 percent in late-onset forms. Diagnosis is more challenging in 
females who may express normal residual enzyme activity. Other plasmatic 
biomarkers, such as lyso-globotriaosylceramide are interesting, especially in 
females. In this review, we aimed to summarize main clinical manifestations of 
Fabry disease to know when to evoke Fabry disease and propose a practical 
diagnosis algorithm to know how to diagnose.
