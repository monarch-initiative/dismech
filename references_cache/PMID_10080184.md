The secreted polypeptide noggin (encoded by the Nog gene) binds and inactivates 
members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of signalling 
proteins (TGFbeta-FMs), such as BMP4 (ref. 1). By diffusing through 
extracellular matrices more efficiently than TGFbeta-FMs, noggin may have a 
principal role in creating morphogenic gradients. During mouse embryogenesis, 
Nog is expressed at multiple sites, including developing bones. Nog-/- mice die 
at birth from multiple defects that include bony fusion of the appendicular 
skeleton. We have identified five dominant human NOG mutations in unrelated 
families segregating proximal symphalangism (SYM1; OMIM 185800) and a de novo 
mutation in a patient with unaffected parents. We also found a dominant NOG 
mutation in a family segregating multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS1; OMIM 
186500); both SYM1 and SYNS1 have multiple joint fusion as their principal 
feature. All seven NOG mutations alter evolutionarily conserved amino acid 
residues. The findings reported here confirm that NOG is essential for joint 
formation and suggest that NOG requirements during skeletogenesis differ between 
species and between specific skeletal elements within species.
