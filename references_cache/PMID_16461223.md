The immune system plays an important role in determining the outcome of 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This is because recovery from of acute HBV 
infection is associated with a clear division in the profile of adaptive immune 
response. Multispecific antiviral CD4 and CD8 responses with a type 1 cytokine 
production can be observed in patients who recover from acute HBV infection. On 
the other hand, those who develop chronic infection tend to have a weak virus 
specific T cell response. Therapeutic strategies aimed at correcting this 
defective T cell reactivity could represent a complementary approach to the cure 
of chronic HBV infection.
