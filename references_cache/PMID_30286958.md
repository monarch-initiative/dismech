Spasticity is a motor disorder that manifests as a component of the upper motor 
neuron syndrome. It is associated with paralysis and can cause significant 
disability. The most common causes leading to spasticity include stroke, 
traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and cerebral 
palsy. This article discusses the pathophysiology and clinical findings 
associated with each of the most common etiologies of upper extremity 
spasticity.
