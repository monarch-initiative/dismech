There is increasing appreciation of nephronophthisis (NPHP) as an autosomal 
recessive cause of kidney failure and earlier stages of chronic kidney disease 
among adults. We identified 2 families with presumed adult-diagnosed 
nonsyndromic NPHP and negative diagnostic genetic testing results from our Renal 
Genetics Clinic. Both had 2 affected siblings without extrarenal phenotypes. 
After informed consent, research whole-genome sequencing was undertaken. 
Biallelic NPHP4 variants were identified in trans and clinically confirmed in 
all 4 affected individuals, confirming a genetic diagnosis. Participant 1 of the 
first family (F1P1) had kidney failure diagnosed at 19 years of age. An affected 
younger sibling (F1P2) reached kidney failure at age 15 years after kidney 
biopsy suggested NPHP. Pathogenic variants detected in NPHP4 in this family were 
NM_015102.4:c.3766C>T (p.Gln1256*) and a 31-kb deletion affecting exons 12 to 
16. In the second family, F2P3 reached kidney failure at age 27 years having 
undergone kidney biopsy suggesting NPHP. An affected younger sibling (F2P4) has 
chronic kidney disease stage 4 at age 39 years. The NPHP4 variants detected were 
NM_015102.4:c.1998_1999del (p.Tyr667Phefs*23) and c.3646G>T (p.Asp1216Tyr). The 
latter variant was initially missed in diagnostic sequencing due to inadequate 
NPHP4 coverage (94.3% exonic coverage). With these reports, we identify NPHP4 as 
an appreciable genetic cause for adult-diagnosed nonsyndromic NPHP that should 
be considered by adult nephrologists.
