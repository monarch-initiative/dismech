Asthma is highly prevalent and sometimes deadly, especially in certain groups. 
The 2019 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines recommend that all 
asthma patients be treated with inhaled corticosteroids taken daily or as 
needed; this improves symptoms and outcomes, even in those with mild disease. 
Further, asthma management requires a stepwise approach, escalating and 
de-escalating treatment based on symptom control.
