The cutaneous manifestations of lupus erythematosus (LE) include LE-specific and 
LE-nonspecific skin lesions. LE-specific skin lesions are divided into chronic, 
subacute, and acute types. The representatives of the chronic and acute types 
are discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and butterfly rash, respectively. Based on 
the systemic manifestations, we can classify LE into cutaneous-limited LE and 
systemic LE (SLE). Chronic LE eruptions tend to be seen in cutaneous-limited LE, 
and acute LE eruptions mainly appear in SLE. Some skin lesions are related to 
the neurological manifestations of SLE.
