Acne vulgaris stands out as the most prevalent skin disorder among teenagers and 
young adults, causing physical discomfort and considerable economic and 
psychological burdens on individuals and society. A wide range of topical and 
systemic therapies are available in acne treatment. Chemical peeling is a skin 
resurfacing technique designed to rebuild healthy skin using exfoliating 
substances, a simple and affordable process with various dermatological uses. 
Chemical peels, classified as superficial, medium, and deep, have been utilized 
for acne vulgaris and multiple other skin issues. In these chemical peels, a 
diverse range of chemical substances is employed, each with its unique mode of 
action. Among these, α-hydroxy and β-hydroxy acids have gathered attention for 
their efficacy in reducing acne lesions and enhancing overall skin appearance. 
Acids, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid, are commonly used 
in chemical peels due to their exfoliating and sebum-regulating properties. 
Despite the widespread use of these acids, there exists a lack of consensus 
regarding the most effective acid type and concentration for treating acne-prone 
skin. This review aims to bridge this knowledge gap by evaluating the 
effectiveness and safety of various organic acids used in chemical peels 
specifically for acne-prone skin. The findings of this comprehensive 
bibliographic review indicate that organic acid-based chemical peels represent 
effective and safe treatment options for individuals with acne-prone skin. Their 
adaptability sets these treatments apart; the choice of organic acid can be 
tailored to meet individual patient needs and tolerability levels. This 
personalized approach ensures that patients receive optimal care while 
minimizing the risks associated with the treatment. As research in this field 
progresses, it is anticipated that a more nuanced understanding of the ideal 
acid type and concentration will emerge, further enhancing the efficacy and 
safety of chemical peels for acne-prone skin.
