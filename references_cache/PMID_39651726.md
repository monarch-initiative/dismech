Although the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine is lifesaving through 
decades, it has been voiced that the vaccine is associated with 50% increase in 
mortality, an alleged negative non-specific vaccine effect prone to girls. Post 
hoc analyses of historical observational data supporting the hypothesis of the 
DTP vaccine having detrimental effects have never been replicated in low- or 
high-income countries. An RCT in Guinea-Bissau found fewer deaths with DTP 
vaccine than without. The hypothesis seems further rejected by the overall 
decline over time in child mortality in both girls and boys.
