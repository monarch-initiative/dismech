HIV-1 infects mononuclear cells using the CD4+ molecule and the chemical 
receptors of those cells. After a prolonged clinical latency period, the ability 
to replace destroyed cells is outpaced by ongoing cellular destruction, leading 
to the characteristic immunodeficiency of AIDS and its opportunistic infections 
and neoplasms. In the United States, the number of new cases of AIDS has 
diminished in recent years, although in some groups, such as women, the number 
of new cases continues to rise. In the developing world, AIDS remains a pandemic 
of huge proportions. In the absence of an effective vaccine, culturally 
appropriate efforts at education and behavior modification offer the best hope 
of controlling AIDS.
