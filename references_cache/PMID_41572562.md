Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia in 
adults. Skin involvement by malignant CLL cells, or leukemia cutis (LC), 
typically presents as localized or generalized papulonodular lesions. Here we 
report a series of five patients with CLL who presented with perniosis-like skin 
findings on the ears, nose, and/or digits. Histopathologic analysis of seven 
skin specimens from these five patients showed a relatively dense, nodular to 
diffuse, pan-dermal infiltrate of monomorphic lymphocytes, compatible with CLL. 
The typical histopathologic findings of perniosis, such as a robust perivascular 
and peri-eccrine infiltrate, dermal edema, and interface change, were absent. In 
one patient, the skin findings heralded the diagnosis of CLL, and in most 
patients the skin lesions tended to improve with systemic treatment of the 
patient's underlying CLL. We suggest the term 'leukemic pernio' for cases of 
leukemia cutis that clinically mimic perniosis.
