Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera, a diarrheal disease that 
kills tens of thousands of people each year. Cholera is transmitted primarily by 
the ingestion of drinking water contaminated with fecal matter, and a safe water 
supply remains out of reach in many areas of the world. In this Review, we 
discuss host and environmental factors that impact the susceptibility to 
V. cholerae infection and the severity of disease.
