OBJECTIVE: To analyse the incidence of dermatoses in neonates, stress the 
importance of simple noninvasive diagnostic procedures with perspective to 
actual need of active intervention.
METHODS: Forty four neonates with vesicobullous lesions in Departments of 
Dermatology and Pediatrics were evaluated with respect to diagnosis, required 
treatments and follow ups.
RESULTS: Of the total 44 neonates, 29 were boys and 15 girls. Low birth weight 
(weight at birth less than 2,500 g as per WHO criteria) was seen in 19 neonates. 
Of the infectious dermatoses, most common were pyodermas. Four cases (9%) were 
diagnosed to be of staphylococcal pyoderma and impetigo and two cases each of 
Group A Streptococcal impetigo and neonatal tinea faciei (4.5% each), one case 
each of neonatal candidiasis, neonatal varicella/chickenpox and scabies (2.3% 
each) were seen. Of the transient skin lesions, erythema toxicum neonatorum was 
commonest of all, being seen in 18 neonates (41%), followed by four cases (9%) 
of miliaria crystallina, three cases of neonatal acne (6.8%) and two cases of 
sucking blisters (4.5%) and one case each of transient neonatal pustular 
melanosis, epidermolysis bullosa simplex, incontinentia pigmentii, eosinophilic 
pustular folliculitis, pemphigus vulgaris and neonatal herpes simplex (2.3% 
each) were enrolled in this study (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Piechart showing percentage 
and number of neonates with different diagnostic profiles in the study 
CONCLUSIONS: Certain specific considerations have to be born in mind while 
evaluating and managing neonatal dermatoses. Care has to be instituted to 
identify accurately infectious diseases and distinguish them from benign 
transient neonatal dermatoses. Some disorders first manifesting during the 
neonatal period may also represent harbingers of potential problems during 
adulthood. Finally, treatment modalities are instituted taking in account the 
actual diagnosis and judging if the treatment really is required or not.
