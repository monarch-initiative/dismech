Gastrointestinal stromal tumor, i.e., GIST is by far the most common mesenchymal 
tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. GIST has received special clinical 
attention, because it is one of the first solid tumors treated with tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors as targeted oncological therapy. Accordingly, accurate 
diagnosis of GIST has become clinically increasingly important. While GISTs were 
previously classified as gastrointestinal smooth muscle or Schwann cell tumors, 
they are now distinguished as a separate, specific tumor entity. Loss of 
succinate dehydrogenase complex is a newly understood pathogenesis for 5% of 
GIST, associated with early onset of disease.
