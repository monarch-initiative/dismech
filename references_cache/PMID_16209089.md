Ethambutol (EMB), the first line drug in the treatment of tuberculosis, is an 
inhibitor of the biosynthesis of the cell wall compound - arabinogalactan. It 
was found that EMB at sub-inhibitory concentration increases the permeability of 
the M. vaccae cell wall, which was monitored by cell sensitization to 
erythromycin and rifampicin. The high permeability of the cell wall to 
hydrophobic compounds allows enhanced intracellular bioconversion of 
beta-sitosterol to 4-androsten-3,17-dione (AD) and 1,4-androstadien-3,17-dione 
(ADD).
