OBJECTIVES: KRAS mutations are one of the most prevalent alterations in 
non-small cell lung cancer. However, patients with this driver alteration 
present heterogeneous clinical outcomes. In this study, we have explored the 
potential clinical impact of coexisting alterations in this subset of patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from a cohort of 69 lung adenocarcinoma patients 
homogenously treated with platinum doublet as first-line therapy were evaluated 
using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). Mutations and copy number 
alterations were assessed in 37 advanced KRAS-mutant (KRASm) and in 32 KRAS 
wild-type (KRASwt).
RESULTS: TP53 was the most frequent additional alteration found in both cohorts. 
Interestingly, TP53 mutations were more frequent in KRASwt than in KRASm 
patients (80 % vs. 34 %; p <  0.05) as well as STK11 mutations (17 % vs 8 %, 
p=NS). FGFR3 mutations were only found concomitantly with KRASm (11 %). No 
genomic co-alteration had an impact on overall survival within the KRASm 
patients treated with chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: KRAS mutated lung adenocarcinoma is a heterogeneous entity and 
comprehensive characterization of co-alterations using NGS may lead to more 
accurate patient stratification.
