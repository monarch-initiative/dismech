BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major cause of childhood death in sub-Saharan 
Africa. We leveraged the traditional practice of mothers carrying children on 
their backs in cloth wraps to assess whether treating the wraps with an insect 
repellent might provide a layer of protection against malaria.
METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 
Uganda, we enrolled adult women with a child who was 6 to 18 months of age. The 
mother-child pairs were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to use 
permethrin-treated wraps (intervention group) or sham-treated wraps (control 
group). The wraps underwent retreatment every 4 weeks. All the participants 
received a new, pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticide-treated bed net. The 
participants visited the trial clinics every 2 weeks for 24 weeks and made 
unscheduled visits in the case of febrile illness in the children. The primary 
outcome was clinical malaria in the children, as defined by fever and a positive 
malaria rapid diagnostic test.
RESULTS: From June 2022 through April 2024, a total of 419 mother-child pairs 
were screened, and 400 underwent randomization; 200 pairs were assigned to the 
intervention group and 200 to the control group. Clinic attendance was high 
(5194 of 5200 planned visits [99.9%] were attended), and no participants were 
lost to follow-up. The incidence rate of clinical malaria was 0.73 cases per 100 
person-weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 1.02) in the intervention 
group and 2.14 cases per 100 person-weeks (95% CI, 1.73 to 2.62) in the control 
group (incidence rate ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.51; P<0.001). Rash was 
reported more often in the intervention group than in the control group (8.5% 
vs. 6.0% of participants).
CONCLUSIONS: Among mother-child pairs who had access to bed nets, maternal use 
of permethrin-treated baby wraps significantly reduced the incidence of clinical 
malaria in the children. (Funded by the Doris Duke Foundation and others;
