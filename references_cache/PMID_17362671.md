With an increasingly aging population, the need for effective treatment of 
cardiovascular diseases (eg, heart failure, hypertension, and ischemic heart 
disease) cannot be overemphasized. The vital importance of mineralocorticoid 
receptor antagonists for treating cardiovascular conditions has only been 
appreciated in the last decade. The re-emergence of mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists has provided clinicians with an important tool towards complete 
blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.
