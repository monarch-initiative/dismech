Abstract
Branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) is the rate limiting enzyme in branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism, a metabolic pathway with great importance for human health. BCKDC belongs to the mitochondrial α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex family, which also includes pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC). Here we revealed that BCKDC can be substantially inhibited by reactive nitrogen species (RNS) via a mechanism similar to what we recently discovered with PDHC and OGDC — modifying the lipoic arm on its E2 subunit. In addition, we showed that such reaction between RNS and the lipoic arm of the E2 subunit can further promote inhibition of the E3 subunits of α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes. We examined the impacts of this RNS-mediated BCKDC inhibition in muscle cells, an important site of BCAA metabolism, and demonstrated that the nitric oxide production induced by cytokine stimulation leads to a strong inhibition of BCKDC activity and BCAA oxidation in myotubes and myoblasts. More broadly, nitric oxide production reduced the level of functional lipoic arms across the multiple α-ketoacid dehydrogenases and led to intracellular accumulation of their substrates (α-ketoacids), reduction of their products (acyl-CoAs), and a lower cellular energy charge. This work revealed a new mechanism for BCKDC regulation, demonstrated its biological significance, and elucidated the mechanistic connection between RNS-driven inhibitory modifications on the E2 and E3 subunits of α-ketoacid dehydrogenases. Together with previous work, we revealed a general mechanism for RNS to inhibit all α-ketoacid dehydrogenases, which has numerous physiological implications across multiple cell types.
