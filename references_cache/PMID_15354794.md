Obesity is a risk factor for the development and progression of radiograhic OA 
and probably works through both mechanical as well as metabolic pathways. We are 
just beginning to unravel these associations. By better understanding these 
associations, improved biomarkers for development and progression of OA and new 
novel therapies for the prevention and treatment of OA may be developed. The 
Osteoarthritis Initiative will help us understand these associations and allow 
us to evaluate new biomarkers for symptomatic incident and progression of 
established knee OA as well as the relationship of obesity and generalized OA.
