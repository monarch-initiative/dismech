# Pirfenidone in the Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Treatment

## Content

The Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP), is an inflammatory disease who has an evolution to develop progressive interstitial fibrosis, who cause the death of the patient. Actually HP has been treated with Prednisone and occasionally with Azathioprine, but unfortunately the treatment with these drugs have not an effective result to treat the interstitial fibrosis.

Pirfenidone has been studied over the world for the treatment of Fibrotic diseases, with positive results, and due to the Pirfenidone mechanism of action has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, the investigators propose to evaluate the addition of Pirfenidone to the actual treatment with Prednisone and Azathioprine in the treatment of patients with Pulmonary Fibrosis secondary to a Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis.
