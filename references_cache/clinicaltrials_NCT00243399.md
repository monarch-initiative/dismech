# A Pilot Trial of Oxandrolone for the Treatment of Bone Marrow Aplasia in Patients With Fanconi Anemia

## Content

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the drug oxandrolone (a type of androgen steroid) in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), and to determine if this drug can help in the treatment of bone marrow failure in these patients. Androgen steroids are male hormones that can stimulate the production of red blood cells (the cells which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help blood clot).
