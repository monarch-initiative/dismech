Extensive use of Vaccinia virus (VACV) in research has led to associated 
accidental human exposure in laboratories worldwide. In spite of the social and 
economic relevance of Bovine Vaccinia outbreaks in Brazil, national data 
concerning laboratory workers handling these infectious agents are relatively 
scarce. Therefore, a serological survey was conducted in a Brazilian laboratory 
to evaluate staff exposure to orthopoxviruses (OPVs). Information concerning 
direct work with OPVs, vaccination status and laboratory accidents was collected 
and correlated to serology results. This study presents an opportunity for 
discussion of routine procedures involving OPVs in laboratories and their 
intrinsic risks. Aspects of the live attenuated smallpox vaccine are also 
discussed.
