Since May 2022, several nonendemic countries face a monkeypox outbreak, with 
clinic and epidemiological characteristics distinct from the classic ones. 
Primarily affecting the sexually active population, these cases present with 
mucocutaneous lesions mainly localized in perioral, genital, and anal areas. A 
retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary center in Lisbon, to 
characterize the population diagnosed with monkeypox infection with primarily 
mucosal involvement.
