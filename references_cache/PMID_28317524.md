Segmental vitiligo is characterized by its early onset, rapid stabilization, and 
unilateral distribution. Recent evidence suggests that segmental and 
nonsegmental vitiligo could represent variants of the same disease spectrum. 
Observational studies with respect to its distribution pattern point to a 
possible role of cutaneous mosaicism, whereas the original stated dermatomal 
distribution seems to be a misnomer. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism 
behind the melanocyte destruction is still unknown, increasing evidence has been 
published on the autoimmune/inflammatory theory of segmental vitiligo.
