BACKGROUND: Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle 
measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug 
to use first-line? This review answers that question.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line 
anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel 
blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).
SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, 
CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of 
the hypertension review group with additional terms.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing 
one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of 
people must have BP >140/90 mmHg at baseline.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, 
coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk 
ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across 
trials.
MAIN RESULTS: Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 
patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 
0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% 
CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) 
reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did 
not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 
0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 
0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE 
inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.95), stroke (RR 
0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% 
CI 0.67-0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 
0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 
0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for 
ARBs or alpha-blockers.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and 
mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may 
be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose 
thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose 
thiazides.
