Cardiovascular manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus: current 
perspective.

Ansari A, Larson PH, Bates HD.

Cardiovascular manifestations develop in the majority of SLE patients at some 
time during the course of their illness, the most common being acute fibrinous 
pericarditis and pericardial effusion. Echocardiography has demonstrated an 
increased incidence of pericardial effusion, even in those who have minimal 
symptoms. Chronic adhesive pericarditis, pericardial tamponade, and constrictive 
pericarditis occur rarely. While myocarditis is commonly noted at autopsy, it is 
often silent clinically. Diagnosis during life can be confirmed only by 
endomyocardial biopsy. Electrocardiographic changes are often nonspecific. 
Endocarditis with superimposed nonbacterial verrucous vegetations (Libman-Sacks) 
is noted in more than 40% of hearts at autopsy, but is rarely diagnosed during 
life. Valve dysfunctions, such as aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, mitral 
stenosis, and mitral insufficiency, occasionally manifest during life and rarely 
may necessitate surgery. Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, first degree AV 
block, and acquired CHB occur in association with pericarditis, myocarditis, 
vasculitis, and myocardial fibrosis, respectively. CCHB developing in newborns 
of mothers with SLE, particularly those who have an antibody to soluble tissue 
ribonuclear protein RO(SS-A), is increasingly being appreciated by both 
pediatric cardiologists and rheumatologists. Recently, severe coronary 
atherosclerosis resulting in angina pectoris and/or myocardial infarction in 
young adults has been noted, particularly in those who had developed risk 
factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia while receiving prolonged 
corticosteroid therapy. Rarely, coronary arteritis may produce similar symptoms. 
Congestive heart failure of either single or multiple etiologies carries an 
ominous prognosis. It remains a cause of high morbidity and mortality unless 
recognized early and treated properly. Extracardiac vascular manifestations of 
SLE include telangiectasia, vasculitis, livedo reticularis, Raynaud's phenomena, 
and thrombophlebitis, all of which may occur either alone or in different 
combinations. Evidence is now slowly accumulating that substantiates that immune 
complex deposition, complement activation and subsequent inflammatory reaction 
is responsible for the majority of the cardiovascular manifestations of SLE, for 
example, pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, coronary arteritis, coronary 
atherosclerosis, and systemic and pulmonary vasculitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT
