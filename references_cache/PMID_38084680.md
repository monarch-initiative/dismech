Markedly Increased Mean Platelet Volume in Bacterial Meningitis.

Kim YJ, Park KS, Cho SY.

BACKGROUND: Differentiating bacterial and viral meningitis is crucial, and this 
study explored the potential of mean platelet volume (MPV) as a marker for 
differentiation.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from patients with central nerve system 
related manifestations, and MPV was tested. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were 
obtained and bacterial culture and the FilmArray ME panel were performed. The 
distribution of MPV was compared between groups.
RESULTS: The study included 8 patients in the bacterial meningitis group and 12 
patients in the viral meningitis group. The bacterial meningitis group showed a 
significantly higher median MPV of 10.9 (9.2 - 11.6) fL compared to the viral 
meningitis group with 8.4 (8.1 - 8.8) fL (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: MPV could serve as a diagnostic indicator to differentiate between 
bacterial and viral meningitis. Larger studies are needed to validate these 
findings.
