Type 1 diabetes is recognized as a chronic disease with a presymptomatic phase 
that does not require insulin therapy and a clinical phase where insulin 
treatment becomes necessary. The presymptomatic phase is characterized by the 
presence of autoantibodies targeting pancreatic islet beta cell antigens (islet 
autoantibodies). This phase is further classified into three stages: Stage 1, 
defined by normoglycaemia; Stage 2, characterized by dysglycaemia; and Stage 3, 
marked by hyperglycaemia, which typically presents clinically and necessitates 
insulin therapy. The prospect of therapies to delay the onset of clinical 
disease and insulin treatment has been a driver of research into the 
presymptomatic phase since the discovery of islet autoantibodies. With the 
recent approval of teplizumab as a therapy to delay disease progression, 
attention has increasingly focused on diagnosing individuals with Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 type 1 diabetes. However, diagnosing an asymptomatic condition that 
affects fewer than 1 in 200 individuals poses significant challenges. As we 
enter this new era of diagnosis, it is crucial to refine diagnostic approaches 
to ensure accuracy and effectiveness. This review summarizes current evidence 
and guidance while emphasizing the need for continued research alongside broader 
application of screening. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Type 1 diabetes is an 
autoimmune disease that affects approximately 0.5% of individuals. In this 
publication, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of strategies for 
identifying individuals in the pre-symptomatic, early stages of the disease. 
Early-stage type 1 diabetes can be detected by the presence of autoantibodies 
against specific proteins in the blood, signaling an ongoing disease process 
before clinical symptoms appear. Genetic factors also contribute to the 
development of these autoantibodies and the disease itself. The paper explores 
how these markers are used for early identification, emphasizing optimal 
screening ages and the role of confirmation tests in preventing misdiagnosis. A 
key consideration in early diagnosis is that disease progression varies-some 
individuals develop clinical diabetes rapidly, while others may take many years. 
The authors discuss additional tests that can help predict how soon a diagnosed 
individual may require insulin treatment. Finally, the paper highlights ongoing 
challenges in optimizing screening for wider application and the complexities of 
integrating research-based screening into routine clinical practice.
