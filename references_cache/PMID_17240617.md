Lung transplantation is a surgical option for patients who fail optimization of 
medical treatment for the severe symptoms that result from COPD. This review 
will discuss patient selection, transplant listing, and the surgical technique 
for transplantation in COPD. Furthermore, it will describe transplant outcomes 
and its effects on recipient survival, pulmonary function, exercise capacity, 
respiratory muscle function, and quality of life. The respective roles of 
transplantation and lung volume reduction surgery as therapies for advanced 
disease will be outlined.
