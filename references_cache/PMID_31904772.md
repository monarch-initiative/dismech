The Many Facets of Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

Riley B.

Of the 13 subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDSs) identified in the 2017 
international classification of EDSs, 12 have a recognized, associated genetic 
mutation. However, hypermobile EDS (hEDS) currently has no identifiable 
associated gene. Therefore, patients with hEDS are identified through a set of 
clinical diagnosis guidelines and criteria, which are meant to differentiate 
hEDS from other hypermobile joint conditions and other EDSs subtypes. In this 
article, the authors provide an overview of hEDS symptoms and comborbidities, 
current treatment options, and the clinical criteria currently guiding the 
standard of care.
