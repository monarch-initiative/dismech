Hepatitis B remains a significant health issue and a leading cause of cirrhosis 
and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Transmission of the hepatitis B virus, 
despite the availability of the vaccine, still occurs, particularly in the 
perinatal setting. Studies have shown that mothers with active viremia 
especially those with very high viral levels (>10⁸ copies/mL or >10⁷ IU/mL) are 
at increased risk of hepatitis B virus transmission, even with appropriate 
immunoprophylaxis at birth. With the development of new and relatively safe oral 
antiviral therapies, assessment with the mother about the risks and benefits of 
antiviral therapy should be discussed in those with highest transmission risk.
