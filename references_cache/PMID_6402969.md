Disorders of gastrointestinal motility associated with diabetes mellitus.

Feldman M, Schiller LR.

Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and fecal 
incontinence occur frequently in patients with diabetes mellitus. In a survey of 
136 diabetic outpatients, 76% had one or more gastrointestinal symptoms, the 
commonest symptom being constipation (found in 60%). In many cases these 
symptoms are thought to be due to abnormal gastrointestinal motility that, in 
turn, may be a manifestation of diabetic autonomic neuropathy involving the 
gastrointestinal tract. The pathophysiology of these gastrointestinal symptoms, 
clarified in recent studies, and the clinical features and treatment of these 
problems in diabetic patients are reviewed.
