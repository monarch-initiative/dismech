BACKGROUND: Joubert syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy 
characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and the distinctive molar tooth 
sign on neuroimaging, often accompanied by neurological impairment. Pathogenic 
CSPP1 variants account for approximately 3% of Joubert syndrome cases. While 
certain ciliopathies have been associated with metabolic dysfunction, this has 
not been described in CSPP1-related Joubert syndrome.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 16-year-old Honduran mestiza female patient with 
CSPP1-related Joubert syndrome who presented with insulin resistance, early 
onset diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic 
liver disease. Notably, she lacked the typical neurological symptoms of Joubert 
syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebellar vermis 
hypoplasia, confirming the diagnosis. Genetic testing identified a pathogenic 
heterozygous CSPP1 variant (c.3052C > T, p.Gln1018), supporting the diagnosis of 
CSPP1-related Joubert syndrome.
CONCLUSION: This case expands the phenotypic spectrum of CSPP1-related Joubert 
syndrome and raises the possibility of a role for CSPP1 in metabolic 
homeostasis. Further research is needed to determine whether CSPP1 mutations 
contribute to metabolic dysfunction via ciliary or centrosome-associated 
mechanisms.
