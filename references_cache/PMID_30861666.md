Cholera is an acute intestinal illness caused by infection with the bacterium 
Vibrio cholerae. The dynamics of the disease transmission are governed by 
human-human, environment-human, and within-human sub-dynamics. A multi-scale 
model is presented to incorporate all three of these dynamical components. The 
model is divided into three subsystems where the dynamics are analyzed according 
to their respective time scales. For each subsystem, we conduct a careful 
equilibrium analysis, with a focus on the disease threshold characterized by the 
basic reproduction number. Finally, the three subsystems are combined to discuss 
the dynamical properties of the full system.
