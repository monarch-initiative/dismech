Large bowel obstruction is a serious event that occurs in approximately 25% of 
all intestinal obstructions. It is attributed to either benign, malignant, 
functional (pseudo-obstruction), or mechanical conditions. Benign etiologies of 
colonic obstructions include colon volvulus, anastomotic strictures, radiation 
injury, ischemia, inflammatory processes such as Crohn's disease, 
diverticulitis, bezoars, and intussusception.
