Mesangial complement C3 deposits, reflecting alternative and possibly lectin 
pathway activation, are characteristic in biopsies of patients with IgA 
nephropathy (IgAN). A recent randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy and 
safety of iptacopan, a factor B inhibitor, in patients with IgAN. Iptacopan 
dose-dependently reduced proteinuria, and there was a pronounced decrease of 
urinary C5b-9. This offers the perspective of "personalizing" therapy, which 
would be a unique feature of this novel approach to IgAN. A phase III clinical 
trial (APPLAUSE-IgAN) is ongoing.
