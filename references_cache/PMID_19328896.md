The problem with empty nose syndrome is probably not that it does not exist, it 
is that we cannot adequately explain its existence by what we currently 
understand about the nose. The result of empty nose syndrome or iatrogenic 
atrophic rhinitis as a consequence of turbinectomy remains a controversial topic 
that deserves further scrutiny. It is clear from the literature, that not 
everyone undergoing a turbinectomy procedure suffers from the debilitating 
symptoms of either atrophic rhinitis or empty nose syndrome. Thus, it behooves 
us to evaluate this latter entity with a more critical eye, so that we can avoid 
creating future sufferers and provide relief to those who have already been 
afflicted.
