The author reviews the gross, microscopic, and biochemical pathology associated 
with classic Pick's disease, as defined by Constantinidis' Type A Pick's 
disease. This is contrasted with other Pick's disease subtypes, including 
Constantinidis' Type B (corticobasal degeneration) and Type C (dementia lacking 
distinctive histology).
