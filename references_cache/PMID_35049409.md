Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) autoantibodies are archetypal biomarkers 
found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although they can exist in any 
isotype, very little is understood about the IgA isotype for which most of our 
knowledge is derived from observational studies. This review article summarises 
our knowledge of this autoantibody isotype to date. Attention will be spent on 
clinical associations as well as its potential links with lupus nephritis for 
which there is still some controversy. Further understanding of this serological 
parameter may facilitate diagnosis, prognosis and treatments of systemic lupus 
erythematosus patients.
