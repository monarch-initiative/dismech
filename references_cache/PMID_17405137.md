Satoyoshi syndrome is a rare postnatal disorder with muscle spasms, alopecia, 
and diarrhea of unknown etiology. Nutritional deficiency seems to influence 
lifespan. We present a patient with this syndrome having a unique "mesh-like" 
mucosal change radiographically and white granules endoscopically in the 
gastrointestinal tract. A common antibody against brain, stomach, and duodenal 
tissue, according to Western blot analysis, was detected in the sera of two 
patients with this syndrome. These findings suggest that Satoyoshi syndrome is a 
systemic autoimmune disease involving the nervous, endocrine, and 
gastrointestinal systems.
