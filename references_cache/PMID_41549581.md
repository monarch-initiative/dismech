Breast cancer continues to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women 
worldwide, with estrogen receptor-positive (ER +) types making up the largest 
portion. At the heart of this subtype is the estrogen signaling pathway, 
especially the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), which plays a major role in the 
development, growth, and response to these cancers. This review takes a close 
look at the structure and function of estrogen receptors and how they influence 
cancer progression. We explore current treatment strategies-including well-known 
drugs such as Tamoxifen and Fulvestrant, as well as aromatase inhibitors-and 
explain how these therapies work and why resistance sometimes develops. This 
review also dives into newer, more targeted options, such as HER2 inhibitors, 
CDK4/6 blockers, and drugs that interfere with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These 
treatments are changing the game for many patients. In addition, the review 
highlights exciting progress in drug design, showing how researchers are 
improving the precision and effectiveness of cancer medications through 
innovations in medicinal chemistry. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are being 
developed to deliver powerful drugs directly to cancer cells with fewer side 
effects. This article also looks at emerging approaches, like oral estrogen 
receptor degraders (SERDs), combination therapies, and precision medicine 
techniques that tailor treatment based on each patient's unique genetic profile. 
Altogether, these developments represent a major step forward in our 
understanding and treatment of ER+ breast cancer.
