BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus infection is a global public health problem. 
Although hepatitis B virus primarily affects hepatocytes, it sometimes develops 
disease manifestations outside the liver, such as myopathy, which is commonly 
caused by chronic hepatitis B.
CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes a 57-year-old Iranian woman 
admitted to the hospital with jaundice, fever, body itching, abdominal pain, 
progressive muscle weakness, icteric sclera, right upper quadrant pain, and 
decreased muscle force. Examination on the first day of admission revealed that 
the patient was negative for hepatitis D antibody, positive for hepatitis B core 
(IgM) antibody, positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, and negative for 
hepatitis B e antibody but positive for hepatitis B e antigen. Moreover, she 
showed high levels of hepatitis B virus DNA viral load, creatine kinase, lactate 
dehydrogenase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic-pyruvic 
transaminase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, and 
electromyography/nerve conduction velocity showed acute myopathic process.
CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, myopathy symptoms improved after improving hepatitis 
symptoms and decreasing hepatitis B viral load, suggesting a close association 
between hepatitis B infection and myopathy.
