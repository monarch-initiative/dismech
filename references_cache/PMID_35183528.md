BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, a cohort of Multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) patients has been described. Cardiac 
involvement is found in 80-85% patients, typically with cardiac dysfunction with 
or without cardiogenic shock. Here, three cardiac biomarkers, BNP, NT-proBNP and 
Galectin-3 were compared for the first time in MIS-C in a unique cohort of 
hospitalized French children.
METHODS: Fourteen children with MIS-C hospitalized at Necker-Enfants Malades for 
cardiac management during the first three COVID-19 waves (March 2020-March 2021) 
were included. All had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology and proven cardiac 
involvement assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. NT-proBNP, BNP and 
Galectin-3 were measured at admission, discharge and first follow-up clinic.
RESULTS: All admission Galectin-3 measurements were comprised within the 
reference interval, both in patients with and without cardiogenic shock, and did 
not vary between admission, discharge and first follow-up clinic. Both median 
admission BNP and NT-proBNP were higher in children with cardiogenic shock than 
without. Median admission NT-proBNP was higher than its predictive positive 
value in heart failure in both groups of children, while median BNP was below 
its negative predictive value in children without cardiogenic shock but with 
cardiac dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3 does not seem affected by MIS-C. NT-proBNP seems to 
increase more precociously than BNP possibly making it a more sensitive marker 
for screening of heart failure in MIS-C.
