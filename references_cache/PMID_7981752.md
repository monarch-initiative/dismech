Kniest and Stickler dysplasia are two chondrodysplasias characterized by 
specific phenotypes. No basic defect has been found in patients with Kniest 
dysplasia, whereas Stickler dysplasia is one of four chondrodysplasias for which 
mutations of type II procollagen gene (COL2A1) have been identified. We studied 
a 2-year-old girl presenting with manifestations of Kniest dysplasia and her 
mother showing a Stickler phenotype. Analysing COL2A1 in both patients, we 
detected the same 28 basepair deletion spanning the 3'-exon/intron boundary of 
exon 12 in mother and daughter. We were able to prove a somatic mosaic status 
for this mutation in the mother which accounts for her milder Stickler-like 
phenotype.
