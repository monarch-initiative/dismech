INTRODUCTION: PAPASH spectrum syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory condition 
encompassing psoriatic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and hidradenitis 
suppurativa. Despite the individual prevalence of these conditions, their 
concurrent manifestation poses a diagnostic challenge that requires high 
clinical suspicion. This case illustrates the consequences of delayed 
recognition of this condition and underscores the crucial need for a 
multidisciplinary approach to optimize management.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 34-year-old African American man with 
a prior diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis who developed migratory arthritis, 
pustular acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Despite suggestive clinical 
features, delayed access to biologic therapy contributed to disease progression 
and resulted in hospitalization. After extensive genetic and clinical 
evaluation, he was diagnosed with PAPASH syndrome.
DISCUSSION: PAPASH syndrome is linked to mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene and the 
overexpression of specific chemokines, which dysregulate interleukin-1 signaling 
and cause persistent inflammation. Although tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors 
remain first-line therapy, limited literature exists on comprehensive treatment 
strategies, and further research is needed. This case demonstrates how ongoing 
diagnostic ambiguity and the absence of clear treatment guidelines can 
complicate the management of PAPASH syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the importance of prompt identification of 
PAPASH syndrome in patients presenting with overlapping inflammatory conditions 
and highlights the need for clinical vigilance, timely initiation of biologic 
agents, and coordinated care to improve outcomes in this rare but serious 
disorder.
