BACKGROUND: Spontaneous sub-amputation is a rare manifestation of critical limb 
ischemia (CLI), most often associated with advanced vascular disease and 
comorbidities. We present a case of spontaneous foot sub-amputation in an 
elderly patient without major lifestyle-related risk factors, managed in a 
resource-limited setting.
CASE REPORT: A 76-year-old male with no history of diabetes, hypertension, or 
smoking presented after his left foot detached spontaneously during sleep, 
following two months of leg pain and two days of worsening discoloration and 
fever. On examination, he was septic, with absent left femoral and popliteal 
pulses and advanced gangrene. Imaging was not performed due to systemic and 
facility constraints. Emergency above-knee amputation was performed. 
Intraoperatively, thrombus removal was achieved using a Foley catheter in place 
of a Fogarty catheter. Postoperatively, the patient stabilized and showed good 
wound healing. Further diagnostics, including histopathology and thrombophilia 
screening, were not feasible due to financial and systemic limitations.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights an atypical CLI presentation in a patient 
without conventional lifestyle-associated risk factors, but with overlooked 
contributors such as prediabetes. The absence of imaging and vascular tools 
required improvisation for timely limb removal. The use of a Foley catheter for 
thrombectomy demonstrates adaptable practice in low-resource environments. 
Although the underlying etiology could not be fully confirmed, acute-on-chronic 
arterial occlusion was the most plausible diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Early recognition, sound clinical judgment, and surgical 
adaptability are vital in underserved settings. This case demonstrates that even 
with limited diagnostics and resources, effective outcomes can still be 
achieved.
