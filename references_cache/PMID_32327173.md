ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up approximately 1% to 
2% of all NSCLC, is oncogenically driven by a constitutively activated ROS1 
kinase paired with certain fusion partners, and can be detected by several 
different assays. These patients are initially treated with tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs), which target the activated ROS1 kinase. Eventually these 
tumors develop resistance to initial TKI treatment through secondary kinase 
mutations that block TKI binding or activation of bypass signaling pathways, 
which subvert ROS1 as the driver of the malignancy. Investigation of several 
TKIs that have shown efficacy in secondary resistant patients is underway.
