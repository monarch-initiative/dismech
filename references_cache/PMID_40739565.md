Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder caused by defects in the repair 
of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs)-highly toxic lesions that impede essential 
processes like DNA replication and transcription, leading to severe genome 
instability. Clinically, FA presents with a broad spectrum of symptoms, 
including progressive bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, and an 
elevated predisposition to various malignancies, particularly acute myeloid 
leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas. This review provides a comprehensive 
overview of both the endogenous and exogenous sources of ICLs and the DNA repair 
pathways responsible for their resolution, with a primary focus on the FA 
pathway. We also discuss the tumorigenic consequences of FA pathway 
deficiencies, highlighting the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the 
heightened cancer risk observed in FA patients.
