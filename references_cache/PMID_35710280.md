Over the past several decades, alcohol septal ablation has become an established 
therapy for selected patients, in whom there is clinical improvement in symptoms 
as well as objective functional capacity. Patient selection is essential to 
success, with continued emphasis on the procedure being performed by experienced 
operators as part of a multidisciplinary team. In many patients, the outcomes of 
alcohol septal ablation are comparable to the standard of surgical myectomy. The 
optimization of the outcomes of alcohol septal ablation is essential for the 
longitudinal care of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
