Eye involvement in Kawasaki disease.

Burke MJ, Rennebohm RM.

Kawasaki disease or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome is an acute febrile 
illness primarily affecting children. The principal signs and symptoms 
recognizable during the acute phase of the illness are described. Kawasaki 
disease is fatal in up to 3% of cases due to cardiac complications secondary to 
a systemic vasculitis. In a prospective series, ophthalmologic examinations on 
10 children with Kawasaki disease showed that eight had anterior uveitis during 
the acute phase of the illness. All cases resolved within two to eight weeks. 
Because of these findings, 15 patients who had had Kawasaki disease with 
documented bilateral conjunctival injection, but who had never undergone 
slit-lamp examinations, were recalled for ophthalmologic evaluation. Results of 
these follow-up examinations were normal in all 15 children.
