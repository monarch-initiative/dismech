Zellweger syndrome: prenatal and postnatal growth failure with epiphyseal 
stippling.

Kumar S, Suthar R, Sharda S, Panigrahi I, Marwaha RK.

We present a 2-month-old male affected by Zellweger syndrome, a rare peroxisomal 
disorder. The diagnosis was supported by clinical and radiological findings and 
established by biochemical tests. The characteristic radiological features 
included anomalous ossification (epiphyseal stippling). We also discuss main 
differential diagnoses of epiphyseal stippling and a brief literature review.
