OBJECTIVE: This paper synthesizes case reports and series to outline the 
clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cadmium poisoning. It 
offers structured evidence to improve understanding, early diagnosis, and 
clinical management, aiding healthcare professionals in prevention and 
intervention.
METHODS: The study protocol has been registered in the PROSOPERO system 
(CRD420251128280). We independently searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane 
databases using keywords including "cadmium poisoning," "case report," and "case 
series." Only English-language case reports and series with confirmed or highly 
suspected cadmium poisoning were included, up to May 2025. Animal studies, 
reviews, and articles lacking individual patient data were excluded. Additional 
references were identified from the bibliographies of retrieved articles. Study 
quality was assessed using the JBI tool for case reports/series.
RESULTS: Among the 12 included studies, there were a total of 17 patients. We 
found that cadmium poisoning primarily affects adult males and is often 
associated with occupational exposure. Common risk factors include smoking and 
alcohol consumption. The study also found that low iron stores exacerbate 
cadmium poisoning. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical diagnostic 
tests, blood and urine tests, chest X-rays, kidney ultrasounds, bone density 
measurements, and skeletal imaging. The treatment plan includes the use of 
chelating agents to reduce cadmium levels in the body and antibiotics to 
maintain the patient's condition. For patients with concurrent lung and kidney 
involvement, mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy 
(CRRT) may be required. Additionally, for patients with osteochondropathy, 
supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is recommended. While most patients 
have a favorable prognosis, fatal cases due to respiratory failure or renal 
failure have been reported.
CONCLUSION: This review emphasizes that cadmium poisoning is rare and complex, 
with non- specific symptoms and a tendency to cause organ damage. Therefore, it 
is necessary to enhance clinical vigilance. Occupational exposure highlights the 
need for public health surveillance. Diagnosis relies on blood or urine cadmium 
testing, which is crucial for guiding treatment. Although the condition is 
relatively uncommon and most patients have a favorable prognosis, the risk of 
severe complications and mortality underscores the importance of timely and 
individualized treatment. Further research is needed to optimize management and 
improve long-term outcomes.
