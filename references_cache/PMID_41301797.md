Background: This study aims to investigate the association between the presence 
and severity of non-motor symptoms (constipation, REM sleep behavior disorder 
[RBD], hyposmia, and depression) and the severity of motor impairment in 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We used data from Parkinson's Progression 
Markers Initiative (PPMI), comprising patients with established PD, prodromal 
PD, and healthy controls. Motor disability was evaluated with the MDS-UPDRS part 
III. Non-motor symptoms were assessed with standardized scales for constipation 
(MDS-UPDRS part I sub-item), depression (15-item GDS), RBD questionnaire (RBDQ), 
and hyposmia (UPSIT). The relationships between non-motor symptoms and motor 
severity were explored using linear regression models (adjusted for age/sex). 
Results: Constipation was significantly more prevalent in PD and prodromal PD 
and independently associated with greater motor severity in both groups (p < 
0.001). Constipation also correlated with increased freezing and falls. 
Depressive symptoms were similar across groups, but in prodromal PD, higher GDS 
scores were associated with worse UPDRS III scores (p = 0.02), as well as higher 
freezing and fall scores. Hyposmia was strongly reduced in PD and prodromal PD 
compared with controls but was not independently associated with motor severity. 
Higher RBDQ scores were associated with worse motor impairment in PD, but not in 
prodromal PD after adjustment. Conclusions: Constipation and REM sleep 
behavioral disorder were independent correlates of worse motor severity in 
prodromal and established PD, whereas depressive symptoms predicted more severe 
parkinsonism only within the prodromal phase.
