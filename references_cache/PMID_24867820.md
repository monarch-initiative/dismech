Local genital tract inflammation stimulates leukocyte activity and causes HIV 
shedding, potentially increasing HIV sexual infectiousness. Although there are 
available clinical markers for genital tract inflammation, such as urinary 
leukocyte esterase, none have yet been examined in relation to HIV sexual risk 
behaviours. We sought to examine the association between urinary leukocyte 
esterase and sexual practices. Sexually active men living with HIV and receiving 
antiretroviral therapy (ART, N = 290) provided urine specimens and completed 
behavioural health assessments. HIV RNA tests and CD4 cell counts were 
abstracted from medical records. Urine specimens were analysed for leukocyte 
esterase using a standard point-of-care dipstick test. Thirty-one (10.6%) 
participants tested positive for leukocyte esterase. Logistic regression models 
did not indicate differences between men with elevated and un-elevated leukocyte 
activity on demographic, health, recent sexually transmitted infection symptoms 
and diagnoses or substance use. However, men with elevated leukocyte activity 
indicated significantly greater sexual behaviour in the previous three months, 
including more recent unprotected sexual intercourse. A simple over-the-counter 
urine test may serve as an indicator of sexual HIV infectiousness to inform 
further evaluation and treatment of genital tract inflammation, as well as 
condom use decisions during times of increased genital tract inflammation.
