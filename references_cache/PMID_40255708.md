Cheilitis granulomatosa (CG) is a persistent and progressive swelling of the 
lips that can be non-tender and soft or firm to touch, with noncaseating 
granulomas that are perilymphatic and may show intralymphatic histiocytosis and 
lymphatic dilatation. CG can occur as an isolated condition or as part of 
Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, which also includes facial paralysis and a 
fissured tongue. The etiology of CG is currently unknown but has been 
hypothesized to be connected to genetics, allergies, immunological processes, 
and infectious causes. This case provides further evidence for the pathogenic 
causes of CG. We present a 46-year-old male patient with four years of 
progressive lip swelling to an outpatient rheumatological clinic, the cause of 
which has yet to be determined following numerous visits to healthcare 
providers. Corticosteroids were previously attempted, resulting in minor 
improvements in swelling; however, following discontinuation, the lip swelling 
returned. Laboratory findings were significant for Saccharomyces and Lyme 
disease, while other autoimmune biomarkers remained negative, and a biopsy 
indicated noncaseating granulomas, leading to the diagnosis of CG. The patient 
was started on mycophenolate, and following treatment, there was a significant 
reduction in the swelling of the lips. As the strongest cause of CG is currently 
unknown, this unique case brings awareness to the infectious causes leading to 
CG. It calls for a greater need to investigate the reason behind certain 
pathogens specifically targeting the lips without causing any other systemic 
effects.
