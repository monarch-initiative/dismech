Disinhibition is a core symptom in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia 
(bvFTD) particularly affecting the daily lives of both patients and caregivers. 
Yet, characterisation of inhibition disorders is still unclear and management 
options of these disorders are limited. Questionnaires currently used to 
investigate behavioural disinhibition do not differentiate between several 
subtypes of disinhibition, encompass observation biases and lack of ecological 
validity. In the present work, we explored disinhibition in an original 
semi-ecological situation, by distinguishing three categories of disinhibition: 
compulsivity, impulsivity and social disinhibition. First, we measured 
prevalence and frequency of these disorders in 23 bvFTD patients and 24 healthy 
controls (HC) in order to identify the phenotypical heterogeneity of 
disinhibition. Then, we examined the relationships between these metrics, the 
neuropsychological scores and the behavioural states to propose a more 
comprehensive view of these neuropsychiatric manifestations. Finally, we studied 
the context of occurrence of these disorders by investigating environmental 
factors potentially promoting or reducing them. As expected, we found that 
patients were more compulsive, impulsive and socially disinhibited than HC. We 
found that 48% of patients presented compulsivity (e.g., repetitive actions), 
48% impulsivity (e.g., oral production) and 100% of the patients group showed 
social disinhibition (e.g., disregards for rules or investigator). Compulsivity 
was negatively related with emotions recognition. BvFTD patients were less 
active if not encouraged in an activity, and their social disinhibition 
decreased as activity increased. Finally, impulsivity and social disinhibition 
decreased when patients were asked to focus on a task. Summarising, this study 
underlines the importance to differentiate subtypes of disinhibition as well as 
the setting in which they are exhibited, and points to stimulating area for 
non-pharmacological management.
