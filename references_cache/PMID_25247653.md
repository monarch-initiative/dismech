Patients with defects in the steroid biosynthesis and resulting disorders of sex 
development are the largest group among patients with such disorders. Many of 
these patients suffer from adrenal insufficiency and have to take either 
glucocorticoids or a combination of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid 
replacement therapy from birth to avoid life-threatening complications. In this 
chapter, the physiologic situation of cortisol secretion and the different 
possibilities of hormone replacement therapy are discussed. Further attention is 
given to stress-dosing of glucocorticoids, especially hydrocortisone.
