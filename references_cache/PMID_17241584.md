BACKGROUND: There are two commonly recognized forms of vitiligo-generalized and 
localized. This classification is important to understand the course of the 
disease and its prognosis. Most patients have generalized vitiligo; few patients 
have both segmented and generalized vitiligo.
OBSERVATION: We report four more cases of mixed vtiligo, segmental with 
generalized type. This report is only the second to present a case of segmental 
with generalized vitiligo.
CONCLUSION: Mixed vitiligo is not yet part of a standard classification. Its 
etiology is not yet fully defined. Further research is required to understand 
the course and prognosis of mixed vitiligo.
