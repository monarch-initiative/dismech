A 47-year-old woman, without significant past medical history, presented an 
acute dyspnea with hypoxia, marked pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and 
signs of right heart failure. Chest x-ray showed a moderate dilatation of the 
right heart cavities. Pulmonary embolism was suggested. After detailed 
questioning and complete explorations, a bird hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) 
was demonstrated. This case illustrates a misleading presentation of an acute 
form of HP consisting of apparently isolated PAH.
