The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target in the 
treatment of advanced stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently 
erlotinib and gefitinib are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 
whereas cetuximab is being studied for use in NSCLC. Erlotinib has shown a 
survival advantage in patients with advanced NSCLC. Further studies have 
identified female sex, nonsmokers, Asian race, good performance status, and 
adenocarcinoma histology as predictors of patient response to these agents. A 
genetic mutation in EGFR has also been correlated with an increase in response.
