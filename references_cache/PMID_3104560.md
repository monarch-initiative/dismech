Dental and craniofacial anomalies of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.

Childers NK, Wright JT.

Apart from the three distinguishing findings for the diagnosis of 
Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (oligodontia, failure of periumbilical skin to 
involute, and ocular anterior chamber defects), a common feature is midface 
hypoplasia. Two theories have been proposed to explain the midface hypoplasia. 
One theory suggests a pleiotropic gene effect of defective neural crest cells, 
while the other theory proposes that midface hypoplasia is a local effect due to 
the absence of teeth. This study presents an evaluation of the craniofacial 
defects in a family affected with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. The maxillary 
deficiency in three affected patients was not limited to the alveolar regions. 
We conclude that a combination of skeletal and dentoalveolar factors contributes 
to the midface hypoplasia associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.
