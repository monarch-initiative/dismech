Chemical-induced depigmentation of the skin has been recognized for more than 
75 years, first as an occupational hazard but then extending to those using 
household commercial products as common as hair dyes. Since their discovery, 
these chemicals have been used therapeutically in patients with severe vitiligo 
to depigment their remaining skin and improve their appearance. Because 
chemical-induced depigmentation is clinically and histologically 
indistinguishable from nonchemically induced vitiligo, and because these 
chemicals appear to induce melanocyte autoimmunity, this phenomenon should be 
known as "chemical-induced vitiligo," rather than less accurate terms that have 
been previously used.
