Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are chronic 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), often associated with mutations in JAK2, 
CALR, and MPL. Differentiating PV from ET can be challenging in borderline 
cases, particularly when hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) and erythropoietin 
(EPO) values are inconclusive. Functional iron parameters and JAK2 variant 
allele frequency (VAF) may provide additional discriminatory value. To assess 
the diagnostic utility of transferrin saturation index (TSI), serum ferritin, 
EPO, and JAK2 VAF in distinguishing PV from ET, and to evaluate their 
association with mutational profiles. We conducted a retrospective, 
single-center study including 260 adult patients diagnosed with PV or ET between 
2009 and 2024. Demographic, clinical, molecular, and laboratory 
parameters-including ferritin, TSI, EPO, Hb, Hct, and JAK2 VAF-were analyzed. 
Comparative and correlation analyses were performed using appropriate 
statistical tests. Compared to ET, patients with PV had significantly lower 
ferritin (median: 35.65 vs. 95.05 ng/mL), TSI (12.9% vs. 21.64%), and EPO (2.23 
vs. 6.11 mIU/mL), but higher Hb (17.7 vs. 14.3 g/dL) and Hct (54.6% vs. 43.0%) 
(all p < 0.001). TSI discriminated PV from ET better than ferritin (p < 0.001 
vs. p = 0.128). Among JAK2-mutated cases, VAF was higher in PV than ET (median: 
48% vs. 21%, p = 0.003). VAF correlated inversely with ferritin, TSI, and EPO, 
and positively with Hct. TSI and JAK2 VAF outperform ferritin as diagnostic 
markers to differentiate PV from ET. Integrating functional iron parameters with 
molecular data improves diagnostic accuracy, particularly in clinically 
ambiguous cases, and supports their inclusion in MPN diagnostic algorithms.

participate: This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent to be 
included in the GEMFIN (Grupo Español de Enfermedades Mieloproliferativas 
Crónicas Filadelfia Negativas) registry. The GEMFIN registry has been approved 
by the appropriate national and regional ethics committee (approval codes 
GEE-AAS-2015-01 and GEE-AAS-2015-02, the latter approved on March 8, 2017). All 
patient data were dissociated and anonymized; no additional informed consent was 
required for this study due to its retrospective nature and because the results 
did not affect the clinical management of patients. Competing interests: The
