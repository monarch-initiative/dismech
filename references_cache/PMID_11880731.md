Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue that 
affects the cardiac, eye, and skeletal systems. More than 135 mutations have 
been identified in the fibrillin-1 gene, localized on chromosome 15q21.1 
[corrected] and responsible for the clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome. 
The major orthopedic manifestations of Marfan syndrome include scoliosis, chest 
wall deformity, dural ectasia, joint hypermobility, and acetabular protrusion. 
In addition, decreased bone mineral density has been reported in patients with 
Marfan syndrome. This review summarizes recent developments in the genetic and 
orthopedic aspects of Marfan syndrome. Increased practitioner awareness of the 
clinical features associated with Marfan syndrome may facilitate earlier 
diagnosis and optimize patient treatment.
