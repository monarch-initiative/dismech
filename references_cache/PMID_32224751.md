Epidemiology and Primary Prevention of Stroke.

Furie K.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an update on the epidemiology and 
prevention of a first stroke. Risk factor modification plays a large role in 
stroke prevention. Strategies for early intervention, particularly for 
hypertension, are critical for reducing stroke morbidity and mortality.
RECENT FINDINGS: Because of the new criteria for hypertension, more people are 
now classified as hypertensive and can benefit from lifestyle or medical 
management. Direct oral anticoagulants have made it easier to safely treat 
patients with atrial fibrillation and are now considered first-line therapy for 
patients with an additional stroke risk factor.
SUMMARY: Primary prevention of stroke is essential for maintaining brain health 
throughout the life span. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle and routine screening 
for stroke risk factors can promote healthy, stroke-free aging.
