Night sweats are a common outpatient complaint, yet literature on the subject is 
scarce. Tuberculosis and lymphoma are diseases in which night sweats are a 
dominant symptom, but these are infrequently found to be the cause of night 
sweats in modern practice. While these diseases remain important diagnostic 
considerations in patients with night sweats, other diagnoses to consider 
include human immunodeficiency virus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
obstructive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, and several less common 
diseases. Antihypertensives, antipyretics, other medications, and drugs of abuse 
such as alcohol and heroin may cause night sweats. Serious causes of night 
sweats can be excluded with a thorough history, physical examination, and 
directed laboratory and radiographic studies. If a history and physical do not 
reveal a possible diagnosis, physicians should consider a purified protein 
derivative, complete blood count, human immunodeficiency virus test, 
thyroid-stimulating hormone test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate evaluation, 
chest radiograph, and possibly chest and abdominal computed tomographic scans 
and bone marrow biopsy.
