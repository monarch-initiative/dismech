OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and isotypes of anti-nodal/paranodal 
antibodies to nodal/paranodal proteins in a large chronic inflammatory 
demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) cohort, compare clinical features in 
seronegative vs seropositive patients, and gather evidence of their 
isotype-specific pathogenic role.
METHODS: Antibodies to neurofascin-155 (Nfasc155), neurofascin-140/186 
(Nfasc140/186), contactin-1 (CNTN1), and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) 
were detected with ELISA and/or cell-based assay. Antibody pathogenicity was 
tested by immunohistochemistry on skin biopsy, intraneural injection, and cell 
aggregation assay.
RESULTS: Of 342 patients with CIDP, 19 (5.5%) had antibodies against Nfasc155 (n 
= 9), Nfasc140/186 and Nfasc155 (n = 1), CNTN1 (n = 3), and Caspr1 (n = 6). 
Antibodies were absent from healthy and disease controls, including neuropathies 
of different causes, and were mostly detected in patients with European 
Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) 
definite CIDP (n = 18). Predominant antibody isotypes were immunoglobulin G 
(IgG)4 (n = 13), IgG3 (n = 2), IgG1 (n = 2), or undetectable (n = 2). IgG4 
antibody-associated phenotypes included onset before 30 years, severe 
neuropathy, subacute onset, tremor, sensory ataxia, and poor response to 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immunosuppressive treatments, including 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate, proved effective if started early 
in IVIG-resistant IgG4-seropositive cases. Five patients with an IgG1, IgG3, or 
undetectable isotype showed clinical features indistinguishable from 
seronegative patients, including good response to IVIG. IgG4 autoantibodies were 
associated with morphological changes at paranodes in patients' skin biopsies. 
We also provided preliminary evidence from a single patient about the 
pathogenicity of anti-Caspr1 IgG4, showing their ability to penetrate paranodal 
regions and disrupt the integrity of the Nfasc155/CNTN1/Caspr1 complex.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm previous data on the tight clinico-serological 
correlation between antibodies to nodal/paranodal proteins and CIDP. Despite the 
low prevalence, testing for their presence and isotype could ultimately be part 
of the diagnostic workup in suspected inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy to 
improve diagnostic accuracy and guide treatment.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that 
antibodies to nodal/paranodal proteins identify patients with CIDP (sensitivity 
6%, specificity 100%).
