BACKGROUND: Human mobility plays a central role in shaping pathogen transmission 
by generating spatial and/or individual variability in potential 
pathogen-transmitting contacts. Recent research has shown that symptomatic 
infection can influence human mobility and pathogen transmission dynamics. 
Better understanding the complex relationship between symptom severity, 
infectiousness, and human mobility requires quantification of movement patterns 
throughout infectiousness. For dengue virus (DENV), human infectiousness peaks 
0-2 days after symptom onset, making it paramount to understand human movement 
patterns from the beginning of illness.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Through community-based febrile surveillance 
and RT-PCR assays, we identified a cohort of DENV+ residents of the city of 
Iquitos, Peru (n = 63). Using retrospective interviews, we measured the 
movements of these individuals when healthy and during each day of symptomatic 
illness. The most dramatic changes in mobility occurred during the first three 
days after symptom onset; individuals visited significantly fewer locations 
(Wilcoxon test, p = 0.017) and spent significantly more time at home (Wilcoxon 
test, p = 0.005), compared to when healthy. By 7-9 days after symptom onset, 
mobility measures had returned to healthy levels. Throughout an individual's 
symptomatic period, the day of illness and their subjective sense of well-being 
were the most significant predictors for the number of locations and houses they 
visited.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study is one of the first to collect and analyze 
human mobility data at a daily scale during symptomatic infection. Accounting 
for the observed changes in human mobility throughout illness will improve 
understanding of the impact of disease on DENV transmission dynamics and the 
interpretation of public health-based surveillance data.
