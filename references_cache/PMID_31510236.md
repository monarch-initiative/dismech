Long-range, high-precision, and high-speed absolute distance measurement based 
on alternately oscillating optoelectronic oscillators.

Xie T, Wang J, Wang Z, Ma C, Yu Y, Zhu J, Yu J.

We propose an absolute distance measurement method using alternately oscillating 
optoelectronic oscillators (OEOs) with high speed, high precision, and long 
range, and describe the dynamic characteristics of the measurement system. 
Measurement and reference OEOs are oscillated using a 2×2 optical switch, and 
rough and fine measurements are achieved by low- and high-order-mode 
oscillation. The distance is determined by the loop length difference between 
the two OEOs. OEO length control is not necessary, so the system is simple and 
the time per measurement is only 40 ms. The maximum measurement error is 3.4 µm 
with an emulated distance of 7.5 km, and the relative measurement accuracy 
reaches 4.5×10-10.
