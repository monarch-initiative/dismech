The authors conducted a retrospective chart review evaluating the predictors of 
success for endoscopic repair of type 1 laryngeal clefts (LC-1) or deep 
interarytenoid notches (DIN). Demographics, birth history, medical 
comorbidities, surgical details, feeding history, and swallow function were 
collected (n = 52). Repair success was defined as improvement on 
videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) when initially evaluating the 
procedure's success (n = 36) and patient-reported symptom improvement when 
assessing predictive factors (n = 48). McNemar or McNemar-Bowker tests evaluated 
VFSS-assessed symptom improvement. Patients with post-operative symptom 
documentation were categorized based on predictors in outcome and assessed for 
post-operative improvement using the Pearson Chi-square test. Postoperatively, 
58 % of patients with VFSS-identified aspiration had resolution. Dysphagia 
severity decreased (p = 0.009) with no severe cases post-repair. Furthermore, 
pregnancy complications, preterm birth, NICU stay, prior airway and feeding 
interventions, and syndromes were not significantly correlated with outcomes. 
However, trends in data suggest that preterm birth and NICU stay are more common 
in unsuccessful repairs. Overall, operative intervention significantly reduced 
aspiration and dysphagia severity.
