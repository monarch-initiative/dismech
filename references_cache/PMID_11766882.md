Ebola viruses belong to the family Filoviridae, which are among the most 
virulent infectious agents known. These viruses cause acute, and frequently 
fatal, hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. Currently, no vaccines 
or treatments are available for human use. This review describes Ebola viruses, 
with a particular focus on the status of research efforts to develop vaccines 
and therapeutics and to identify the immune mechanisms of protection.
