Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor, predominantly 
affecting adolescents and young adults. Despite advances in surgery and 
multi-agent chemotherapy, survival rates for metastatic or recurrent OS remain 
poor, highlighting the need for novel prognostic and therapeutic strategies. 
This review integrates histopathologic, molecular, and immune perspectives to 
provide a comprehensive understanding of OS biology in the context of precision 
medicine. We discuss classic morphologic and radiographic features alongside 
recent insights into the tumor microenvironment, including the role of 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor-associated macrophages, and immune 
checkpoint expression. Emerging molecular markers, such as gene expression-based 
immune risk signatures, circulating tumor DNA, and gasdermin D overexpression, 
are evaluated for their prognostic and therapeutic relevance. Key dysregulated 
pathways, including WNT/β-catenin and JAK/STAT, are examined in relation to 
metastasis, chemoresistance, and immune evasion, with emphasis on current 
targeted approaches under development. By bridging histopathology, 
immunogenomics, and translational research, this work outlines how integrated 
biomarker assessment can refine patient stratification and guide the 
implementation of individualized treatment strategies in OS.
