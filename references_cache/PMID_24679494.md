Portal hypertension is a major complication of liver disease that results from a 
variety of pathologic conditions that increase the resistance to the portal 
blood flow into the liver. As portal hypertension develops, the formation of 
collateral vessels and arterial vasodilation progresses, which results in 
increased blood flow to the portal circulation. Hyperdynamic circulatory 
syndrome develops, leading to esophageal varices or ascites. This article 
summarizes the factors that increase (1) intrahepatic vascular resistance and 
(2) the blood flow in the splanchnic and systemic circulations in liver 
cirrhosis. In addition, the future directions of basic/clinical research in 
portal hypertension are discussed.
