BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are found in Ehlers Danlos 
syndrome (EDS) hypermobility subtype (HM). We aimed to assess associations 
between EDS HM and other EDS subtypes with GI manifestations.
METHODS: We reviewed medical records of EDS patients evaluated at Mayo Clinic's 
Medical Genetics Clinic 1994-2013. We extracted information regarding EDS 
subtypes, GI manifestations, and treatments.
KEY RESULTS: We identified 687 patients; 378 (56%) had associated GI 
manifestations (female 86.8%, diagnosis mean age 29.6 years). Of the patients 
identified, 58.9% (43/73) had EDS classic, 57.5% (271/471) EDS HM, 47.3% (27/57) 
EDS vascular subtypes. In addition, 86 patients had EDS that could not be 
classified in any of those three subtypes. Commonest GI symptoms were: abdominal 
pain (56.1%), nausea (42.3%), constipation (38.6%), heartburn (37.6%), and 
irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms (27.5%). Many GI symptoms were commoner 
in EDS HM than the other subtypes together. Among 37.8% of the 378 patients who 
underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the commonest abnormalities were 
gastritis, hiatal hernia and reflux esophagitis. Abnormal gastric emptying was 
observed in 22.3% (17/76): 11.8% delayed and 10.5% accelerated. Colonic transit 
was abnormal in 28.3% (13/46): 19.6% delayed and 8.7% accelerated. Rectal 
evacuation disorder was confirmed in 18/30 patients who underwent anorectal 
manometry. Angiography showed aneurysms in abdominal vessels in EDS vascular 
type. Proton pump inhibitors (38%) and drugs for constipation (23%) were the 
most commonly used medications. A minority underwent colectomy (2.9%) or small 
bowel surgery (4%).
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: EDS HM and other subtypes should be considered in 
patients with chronic functional GI symptoms and abdominal vascular lesions.
