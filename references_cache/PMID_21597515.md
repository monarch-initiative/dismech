A man, 56 years of age, presents to his general practitioner after coughing up 
half a cupful of fresh, bright red blood every day for 1 week. He has no other 
medical complaints. He reports previous pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago 
treated with 6 months of standard therapy. Routine follow up was discontinued 
after 5 years after no evidence of reactivation. He is a nonsmoker, does office 
clerical duties and is not known to have diabetes or hypertension.
