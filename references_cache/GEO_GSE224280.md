# Transcriptome profiling of lesional skin from Spink5 conditional knock-out mice

## Content

We generated a viable mouse model of Netherton syndrome by conditional ablation of Spink5 gene in the epidermis. To characterize this model at the molecular level, we induced Spink5 deletion in young adult mice and collected lesional skin samples for transcriptome analyses.
