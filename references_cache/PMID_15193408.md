Control measures to limit the spread of a cholera outbreak in Pohnpei Island 
(Micronesia), included mass vaccination with the single-dose live-attenuated 
oral cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR as a potential adjunct measure. The outbreak 
provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the practicality of use and 
effectiveness of this vaccine. Under field conditions encountered in Pohnpei, 
crude vaccine efficacy was estimated at 79.2% (95% CI: 71.9-84.6%) in the target 
population. Retrospective analysis suggests that mass vaccination with oral 
cholera vaccines can be a useful adjunct tool for controlling outbreaks, 
particularly if implemented early in association with other standard control 
measures.
