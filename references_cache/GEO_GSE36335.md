# Distinct tumorigenic pathways within hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer

## Content

Gene expression profiling has discriminated between sporadic microsatellite instable (MSI) and microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers (CRCs), whereas the expression pattern of familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX) and Lynch syndrome (LS) associated CRCs remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to use gene expression profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens from FCCTX, LS and sporadic CRC as a control to detect expression patterns and to identify signaling pathways differing between FCCTX and LS tumors.
