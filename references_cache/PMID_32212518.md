BACKGROUND: Patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia need regular 
red-cell transfusions. Luspatercept, a recombinant fusion protein that binds to 
select transforming growth factor β superfamily ligands, may enhance erythroid 
maturation and reduce the transfusion burden (the total number of red-cell units 
transfused) in such patients.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we assigned, in a 2:1 
ratio, adults with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia to receive best 
supportive care plus luspatercept (at a dose of 1.00 to 1.25 mg per kilogram of 
body weight) or placebo for at least 48 weeks. The primary end point was the 
percentage of patients who had a reduction in the transfusion burden of at least 
33% from baseline during weeks 13 through 24 plus a reduction of at least 2 
red-cell units over this 12-week interval. Other efficacy end points included 
reductions in the transfusion burden during any 12-week interval and results of 
iron studies.
RESULTS: A total of 224 patients were assigned to the luspatercept group and 112 
to the placebo group. Luspatercept or placebo was administered for a median of 
approximately 64 weeks in both groups. The percentage of patients who had a 
reduction in the transfusion burden of at least 33% from baseline during weeks 
13 through 24 plus a reduction of at least 2 red-cell units over this 12-week 
interval was significantly greater in the luspatercept group than in the placebo 
group (21.4% vs. 4.5%, P<0.001). During any 12-week interval, the percentage of 
patients who had a reduction in transfusion burden of at least 33% was greater 
in the luspatercept group than in the placebo group (70.5% vs. 29.5%), as was 
the percentage of those who had a reduction of at least 50% (40.2% vs. 6.3%). 
The least-squares mean difference between the groups in serum ferritin levels at 
week 48 was -348 μg per liter (95% confidence interval, -517 to -179) in favor 
of luspatercept. Adverse events of transient bone pain, arthralgia, dizziness, 
hypertension, and hyperuricemia were more common with luspatercept than placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia 
who had a reduction in transfusion burden was significantly greater in the 
luspatercept group than in the placebo group, and few adverse events led to the 
discontinuation of treatment. (Funded by Celgene and Acceleron Pharma; BELIEVE
