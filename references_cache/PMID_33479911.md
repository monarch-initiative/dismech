Type 1 diabetes is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by 
immune-mediated beta cell destruction in pancreatic islets, which results in 
deficient insulin production. B cells have a dual role in type 1 diabetes 
pathogenesis. A pathogenic role for B cells has been widely described and is 
supported by the observation of a delay in the loss of C-peptide following 
B-cell depletion by Rituximab, in the first year after diagnosis. However, it is 
now clear that B cells, under certain conditions, can delay and prevent the 
onset of type 1 diabetes as demonstrated in mouse models. In this chapter, we 
describe the methods required to study the phenotype and function of regulatory 
B cells in the context of diabetes.
