Skin cancer: role of ultraviolet radiation in carcinogenesis.

Mancebo SE, Wang SQ.

UV radiation is a carcinogen known to play a role in the development of 
non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers. Acute and chronic exposure to UV 
radiation causes clinical and biological effects that promote the unregulated 
proliferation of skin cells. In recent decades, changes in climate and increased 
air pollution have led to environmental changes that increase UV light 
transmission. In this chapter, we discuss sources of UV radiation that are 
relevant to human health, as well as the acute and chronic effects that result 
from UV radiation exposure.
