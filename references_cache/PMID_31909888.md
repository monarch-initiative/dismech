OBJECTIVE: The type 1 and type 2 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
categorization system was recently proposed to validate the patients' 
perspective of disease and to capture a more comprehensive spectrum of symptoms. 
The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical manifestations of 
SLE subtypes and to determine the correlation between the patient- and 
physician-reported measures used in the model.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of patients with SLE in a university 
clinic. Patients completed the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) and 
2011 American College of Rheumatology fibromyalgia (FM) criteria. Active SLE was 
defined as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score 
≥6, clinical SLEDAI score ≥4, or active lupus nephritis. We identified 4 groups: 
type 1 SLE (active SLE without FM), type 2 SLE (inactive SLE with FM), mixed SLE 
(active SLE with FM), and minimal SLE (inactive SLE without FM).
RESULTS: In this cohort of 212 patients (92% female, mean age 45 years), 30% had 
type 1 SLE, 8% had type 2 SLE, 13% had mixed SLE, and 49% had minimal SLE. 
Regardless of SLE disease activity, patients with FM (21%), reported higher SLAQ 
scores, patient global assessment scores, and self-reported lupus flare that 
resulted in discordance between patient- and physician-reported measures.
CONCLUSION: Fatigue, widespread pain, sleep dysfunction, and mood disorders are 
common symptoms in SLE. Identifying these symptoms as type 2 SLE may be a method 
to improve patient communication and understanding. The level of type 2 SLE 
impacts patients' perception of disease and self-reported symptoms. The SLAQ may 
need to be reinterpreted based on the FM severity scale.
