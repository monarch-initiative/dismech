## Content

This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study with 12 weeks of treatment of acne vulgaris. Efficacy and safety evaluations will be performed at Screening (safety only), Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12. All Investigator's Global Assessment evaluators and lesion counters must be trained and approved by Galderma. The evaluator of a subject should remain the same during the study.

The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority in efficacy and assess safety of Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel (Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel) versus Adapalene Topical Gel, 0.1% (Adapalene Monad); Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 2.5% (Benzoyl Peroxide Monad) and Topical Gel Vehicle (Gel Vehicle) in the treatment of acne vulgaris for up to 12 weeks.
