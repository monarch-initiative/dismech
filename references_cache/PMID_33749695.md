A 30-year-old female patient with a past medical history of pernicious anaemia 
presented with pleuritic chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, coryzal symptoms and 
a high temperature. She was hypoxic and tachycardic and was extensively 
investigated as well as aggressively treated. A type 1 'gut feeling' assessment 
by the admitting medical registrar made the diagnosis possible as thyroid 
function tests were grossly deranged and pointed to Graves' disease causing 
heart failure, complicated by pneumonia. The patient was discharged on 
carbimazole, antibiotics and beta blockers. Due to a resultant 
thrombocytopaenia, she has now been swapped onto propylthiouracil and is under 
active follow up.
