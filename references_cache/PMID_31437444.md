Skin depigmentation diseases, such as vitiligo, are pigmentation disorders that 
often destroy melanocytes. However, their pathological mechanisms remain 
unclear, and therefore, promising treatments or prevention has been lacking. 
Here, we demonstrate that a zebrafish insertional mutant showing a significant 
reduction of nicastrin transcript possesses melanosome maturation defect, 
Tyrosinase-dependent mitochondrial swelling, and melanophore cell death. The 
depigmentation phenotypes are proven to be a result of γ-secretase inactivation. 
Furthermore, live imaging demonstrates that macrophages are recruited to and can 
phagocytose melanophore debris. Thus, we characterize a potential zebrafish 
depigmentation disease model, a nicastrinhi1384 mutant, which can be used for 
further treatment or drug development of diseases related to skin depigmentation 
and/or inflammation.
