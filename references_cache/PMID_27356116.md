Comprehensive lifestyle interventions, including nutrition, physical activity, 
and behavioral therapy, are the foundation for clinical obesity management. New 
tools and treatment approaches help clinicians provide these interventions and 
support weight management in the primary care setting. Escalating treatment, 
such as using pharmacotherapy, medical devices, or bariatric surgery, are 
important considerations for appropriate patients who do not respond to 
lifestyle counseling. This article provides a review of obesity treatment in 
primary care and managed care settings. Principles of lifestyle changes for 
weight management, behavioral counseling, and options for pharmacotherapy, 
medical devices, and bariatric surgery are discussed.
