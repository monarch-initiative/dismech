Routine diagnostic electron microscopy of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is 
based on the findings of ultrastructural defects of axonemal components. 
Assessment of the typical abnormalities can be enhanced by improving the sample 
preservation status using tannic acid (TA) as additive in the biopsy fixation or 
processing steps. Another option is the implementation of computer-assisted 
image analysis tools. Advancements in high-resolution 3D visualization of the 
axonemal structure have been noted, with great potential for the future 
diagnosis of inherited cilia disorders.
