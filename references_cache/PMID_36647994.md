Rhabdomyolysis is not a well-known complication in dengue fever and only a few 
cases are reported. We report a patient of dengue, with severe body ache and 
myalgia, passed reddish-brown urine with a very high creatine-phosphokinase 
level. He also developed oliguria, hypertension, and raised creatinine. This 
suggests rhabdomyolysis occurred which led to acute kidney injury. This can 
complicate otherwise stable patients with dengue and affect the outcome. This 
complication needs to be explored when a similar clinical picture is 
encountered.
