RATIONALE: Legionella pneumophila (LP) and Tropheryma whipplei (TW) have been 
identified as pathogens that can coexist in sewage environments, which can both 
cause pneumophila and can impact various organs, leading to extrapulmonary 
manifestations. It is rare to find literature on pneumonia caused by atypical 
pathogens, such as the combination of LP and TW. There are no reports on 
specific drug treatments for such combined infections.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old male with no underlying diseases developed 
community-acquired pneumonia. His condition worsened after empirical treatment 
with piperacillin/tazobactam. He subsequently experienced adverse drug reactions 
after using moxifloxacin.
DIAGNOSES: Pulmonary infection, pulmonary bullae.
INTERVENTIONS: After admission, the patient was treated with 
piperacillin/tazobactam and moxifloxacin for anti-infection. He also underwent a 
bronchoscopy of the lungs, and the alveolar lavage fluid was tested using 
targeted next-generation sequencing. The results identified pathogens such as LP 
and TW. The anti-infection regimen was then adjusted to a combination of 
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Symptomatic treatments were also provided, 
including expectorant therapy, liver protection, and nutritional support.
OUTCOMES: The patient was discharged after showing signs of improvement and was 
subsequently monitored at an outpatient clinic.
LESSONS: When empirical antibiotic therapy for pneumonia is ineffective, 
infections caused by atypical pathogens should be considered. To prevent 
progression to severe pneumonia and even patient death, the precise use of 
antibiotics is beneficial for improving patient outcomes. However, the diagnosis 
of atypical pathogens is challenging, and the selection of drugs also needs to 
be considered from multiple aspects.
