## Content

Malfunction of the sialic acid transporter caused by various genetic mutations in the
            SLC17A5
            gene encoding Sialin leads to a spectrum of neurodegenerative conditions called free sialic acid storage disorders. Unfortunately, how Sialin transports sialic acid/proton (H
            +
            ) and how pathogenic mutations impair its function are poorly defined. Here, we present the structure of human Sialin in an inward-facing partially open conformation determined by cryo–electron microscopy, representing the first high-resolution structure of any human SLC17 member. Our analysis reveals two unique features in Sialin: (i) The H
            +
            coupling/sensing requires two highly conserved Glu residues (E171 and E175) instead of one (E175) as implied in previous studies; and (ii) the normal function of Sialin requires the stabilization of a cytosolic helix, which has not been noticed in the literature. By mapping known pathogenic mutations, we provide mechanistic explanations for corresponding functional defects. We propose a structure-based mechanism for sialic acid transport mediated by Sialin.
