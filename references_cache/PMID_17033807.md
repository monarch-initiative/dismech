Clinical characteristics to predict the development of coronary artery 
abnormalities (CAA) in Kawasaki disease (KD) were assessed by reviewing medical 
records of patients diagnosed with KD at Korea University Medical Center from 
March 2001 to February 2005. Of the 285 patients diagnosed with KD, 19 developed 
CAA (6.7%). Compared with the CAA(-) group, the CAA(+) group had a longer 
duration of fever after intravenous gamma-globulin (IVGG) injection (2.4+/-2.9 
vs. 1.5+/-1.2 days, p=0.008) and higher C-reactive protein (CRP)(12.3+/-7.8 vs. 
8.7+/-7.1 mg/dL, p=0.038). In particular, the CAA(+) group tended to have more 
than 7 days of fever before IVGG and more than 3 days of fever after IVGG (26.3 
vs. 5.3%, p<0.001; 26.3 vs. 6.4%, p=0.002). When the IVGG responsiveness was 
defined by the presence of defervescence within 3 days after IVGG, 
IVGG-non-responders showed a higher incidence of CAA (22.7 vs. 5.3%, p=0.002). 
Non-responders had a longer duration of fever after IVGG (5.5+/-1.9 vs. 
1.2+/-0.6 days, p<0.001) and a significantly increased CRP, AST, ALT and total 
bilirubin. Multivariate regression analysis for CAA showed that the only factor 
significantly associated with the development of CAA was total fever that lasted 
for longer than 8 days (OR=4.052, 95% CI=1.151-14.263, p=0.0293). Conclusively, 
the most important predictor of CAA in KD is total duration of fever longer than 
8 days. Early identification of IVGG non-responders and active therapeutic 
intervention for fever in KD cases might decrease the incidence of CAA.
