Multiple sclerosis is a chronic demyeliniting disease of the central nervous 
system which is characterized by an extreme multiplicity of clinical features. 
Multiple sclerosis can have a profound impact on the quality of life of 
patients. The induced handicap varies from one patient to an other, and depends 
on the location of the demyeliniting lesions. Among the symptoms, sensory-motor 
disorders and genito-sphincter dysfunctions are some of the more disabling. 
Thus, up to 70% of patients suffer from urinary troubles, and 15 years after the 
onset of the illness, 50% of patients have difficulties for deambulation. A good 
knowledge of these pathologies is necessary to improve the management of 
patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.
