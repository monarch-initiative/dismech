Intra-MHC sequences including MHC class I chain-related genes (MICAs), D6S273 
and D6S2223 are associated with autoimmune diseases in addition to HLA class II. 
In the current study, we ascertained the haplotypes of 57 Caucasian patients 
with Addison's disease composed of these genetic markers and compared them 
either with 72 general population controls or with 105 child controls carrying 
Addison's disease high-risk DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 genotypes. The MICA-A5.1/A5.1 
genotype as well as HLA DR3/4 especially with DRB1*0404 were the main 
susceptibility markers. The homozygous MICA-A5.1/A5.1 genotype was significantly 
more frequent in the patients with Addison's disease (61%) than in the healthy 
controls (6%). The MICA-A5.1 allele was increased on both the DR3 and DR4 
haplotypes, independent of DQ and DRB1 subtyping, in the patients with Addison's 
disease compared with the controls. Furthermore, the D6S273*140 allele on the 
DR3 haplotype and the D6S273*134 allele on the DR4 haplotype in the DR3/4 
heterozygotes influenced susceptibility relative to the DR3/4 controls. The risk 
for Addison's disease was increased for the 
DR3-D6S273*140-MICA-A5.1/DRB1*0404-D6S273*134-MICA-A5.1 genotypes compared with 
that conferred by the DR3/4 controls. Susceptibility to Addison's disease is 
influenced by the genes around MICA and D6S273 for both the HLA DR3-DQ2 and 
DR4-DQ8 haplotypes.
