BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a disease characterized by end-organ complications, 
leading to high morbidity and mortality in many cases. People with untreated or 
uncontrolled hypertension often run the risk of developing complications 
directly associated with the disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has 
been shown to be a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes both in patients 
with hypertension and in the general population. We investigated the prevalence 
and pattern of LVH in a treated hypertensive population at the University 
College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, using non-hypertensive subjects as control. 
Design and Setting : A prospective observational study performed at the 
University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.
METHODS: Patients had 6 visits, when at least one blood pressure measurement was 
recorded for each hypertensive subject and average calculated for systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) separately. The values 
obtained were used for stratification of the subjects into controlled and 
uncontrolled hypertension. Subjects also had echocardiograms to determine their 
left ventricular mass.
RESULTS: LVH was found in 14 (18.2%) of the normotensive group, 40 (20.8%) of 
the uncontrolled hypertensive group and 14 (24.1%) of the controlled 
hypertensive group when left ventricular mass (LVM) was indexed to body surface 
area (BSA). When LVM was indexed to height, left ventricular hypertrophy was 
found in none of the subjects of the normotensive group, while it was found 
present in 43 (22.4%) and 14 (24.1%) subjects of the uncontrolled and controlled 
hypertensive groups, respectively. Significant difference in the prevalence of 
LVH was detected only when LVM was indexed to height alone.
CONCLUSION: Clinic blood pressure is an ineffective way of assessing BP control. 
Thus in apparently controlled hypertensive subjects, based on office blood 
pressure, cardiac structural changes do remain despite antihypertensive therapy. 
This population is still at risk of cardiovascular events.
