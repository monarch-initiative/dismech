## Content

AbstractImprovements in therapies for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are crucial for improving patient outcomes and quality of life. Although HFpEF is the predominant heart failure type among older individuals, its prognosis is often poor owing to the lack of effective therapies. The roles of the spleen and bone marrow are often overlooked in the context of HFpEF. Recent studies suggest that the spleen and bone marrow could play key roles in HFpEF, especially in relation to inflammation and immune responses. The bone marrow can increase production of certain immune cells that can migrate to the heart and contribute to disease. The spleen can contribute to immune responses that either protect or exacerbate heart failure. Extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen could play a crucial role in HFpEF. Increased metabolic activity in the spleen, immune cell production and mobilization to the heart, and concomitant cytokine production may occur in heart failure. This leads to systemic chronic inflammation, along with an imbalance of immune cells (macrophages) in the heart, resulting in chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis, potentially leading to decreased cardiac function. The bone marrow and spleen are involved in altered iron metabolism and anemia, which also contribute to HFpEF. This review presents the concept of an interplay between the heart, spleen, and bone marrow in the setting of HFpEF, with a particular focus on extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. The aim of this review is to discern whether the spleen can serve as a new therapeutic target for HFpEF.
