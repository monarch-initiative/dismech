Huntington disease is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder that displays an 
autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance. It is characterized by motor, 
psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms that progress over 15-20 years. Since the 
identification of the causative genetic mutation in 1993 much has been 
discovered about the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, but as yet there are no 
disease-modifying therapies available. This chapter reviews the epidemiology, 
genetic basis, pathogenesis, presentation, and clinical management of Huntington 
disease. The principles of genetic testing are explained. We also describe 
recent developments in the ongoing search for therapeutics and for biomarkers to 
track disease progression.
