Arsenic is a naturally occurring toxic metalloid of global concern. Many studies 
have indicated a dose-response relationship between accumulative arsenic 
exposure and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in arseniasis-endemic 
areas in Taiwan and Bangladesh, where arsenic exposure occurs through drinking 
water. Epidemiological researches have suggested that the characteristics of 
arsenic-induced DM observed in arseniasis-endemic areas in Taiwan and Mexico are 
similar to those of non-insulin-dependent DM (Type 2 DM). These studies analyzed 
the association between high and chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic in 
drinking water and the development of DM, but the effect of exposure to low to 
moderate levels of inorganic arsenic on the risk of DM is unclear. Navas-Acien 
et al. recently proposed that a positive association existed between total urine 
arsenic and the prevalence of Type 2 DM in people exposed to low to moderate 
levels of arsenic. However, the diabetogenic role played by arsenic is still 
debated upon. An increase in the prevalence of DM has been observed among 
residents of highly arsenic-contaminated areas, whereas the findings from 
community-based and occupational studies in low-arsenic-exposure areas have been 
inconsistent. Recently, a population-based cross-sectional study showed that the 
current findings did not support an association between arsenic exposure from 
drinking water at levels less than 300 μg/L and a significantly increased risk 
of DM. Moreover, although the precise mechanisms for the arsenic-induced 
diabetogenic effect are still largely undefined, recent in vitro experimental 
studies indicated that inorganic arsenic or its metabolites impair 
insulin-dependent glucose uptake or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. 
Nevertheless, the dose, the form of arsenic used, and the experimental duration 
in the in vivo studies varied greatly, leading to conflicting results and 
ambiguous interpretation of these data with respect to human exposure to arsenic 
in the environment. Moreover, the experimental studies were limited to the use 
of arsenic concentrations much higher than those relevant to human exposure. 
Further prospective epidemiological studies might help to clarify this 
controversy. The issues about environmental exposure assessment and appropriate 
biomarkers should also be considered. Here, we focus on the review of mechanism 
studies and discuss the currently available evidence and conditions for the 
association between environmental arsenic exposure and the development of DM.
