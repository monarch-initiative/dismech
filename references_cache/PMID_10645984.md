Parvovirus B19 infection is associated with anemia and spontaneous abortions. 
While many qualitative assays are available, a few molecular-based quantitative 
methods have been described. This study reports the development and optimization 
of a quantitative direct-probe method for the detection of Parvovirus B19 DNA. 
Different concentrations of RNA probes were used to identify the optimal 
conditions for hybridizing to the target DNA. Detection of DNA was linear 
between concentrations of 2 ng/ml to 200 pg/ml. Because this method requires no 
enzymatic amplification, it is not susceptible to amplifier contamination or 
enzymatic inhibitors, and it can be applied to serum samples or 
paraffin-embedded tissue.
