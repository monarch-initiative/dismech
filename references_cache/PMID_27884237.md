Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is characterized by 
alterations in LV diastolic filling, and is a strong predictor of cardiovascular 
events and heart failure. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for 
LVDD in the community and promotes LVDD through several mechanisms, including 
hemodynamic overload and myocardial ischemia. Associated factors such as age, 
ethnicity, dietary sodium, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney 
disease also contribute to LVDD in hypertensive individuals. Blood pressure 
lowering using antihypertensive medications can improve LVDD; however, it 
remains unclear whether this improvement in LV diastolic function can improve 
cardiovascular outcomes.
