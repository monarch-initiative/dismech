Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common cause of chronic hepatitis and 
end-stage liver disease worldwide. Untreated, chronic hepatitis B acquired early 
in life results in cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma in up 
to 40% of individuals. Until recently, the options for a patient who had 
end-stage hepatitis B cirrhosis were severely limited, but during the past 15 
years great strides have been made in prevention and treatment of hepatitis B 
cirrhosis. This article reviews recent advances in the understanding of the 
natural history, prevention, and medical management of HBV-related end-stage 
liver disease.
