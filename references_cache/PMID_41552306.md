PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) 
for Kümmell's disease with vertebral posterior wall defects but no neurological 
symptoms.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 79 patients with Kümmell disease, who 
were divided into an experimental group (with vertebral posterior wall rupture, 
n = 46) and a control group (with vertebral posterior wall intact, n = 33) based 
on imaging findings. Their vertebral height recovery, kyphosis correction, 
cement leakage rate, VAS scores, and postoperative changes were compared.
RESULTS: After 10-26 months (avg. 18.9 months) of follow-up, both groups 
improved in vertebral height and Cobb angle post-operation. The control group 
had better postoperative vertebral height and Cobb angle recovery. At the last 
follow-up, the experimental group had more height and Cobb angle loss. VAS 
scores improved in both groups with no difference between them. There were 5 
cement leakage cases in the experimental group and 3 in the control group, with 
no neurological symptoms (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: PKP is safe and effective for stage III Kümmell's disease with or 
without posterior wall integrity. However, having intact posterior walls is 
better for maintaining vertebral height in long-term.
