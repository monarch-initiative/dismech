## Content

Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) controls eukaryotic mRNA quality, inducing the degradation of faulty transcripts. Key players in the NMD pathway were originally identified, through genetics, inCaenorhabditis elegansassmg(suppressor with morphological effect on genitalia) genes. Using forward genetics and fluorescence-based NMD reporters, we reexamined the genetic landscape underlying NMD. Employing a novel strategy for mapping sterile mutations, Het-Map, we identifiedclk-2, a conserved gene previously implicated in DNA damage signaling, as a player in the nematode NMD. We find that CLK-2 is expressed predominantly in the germline, highlighting the importance of auxiliary factors in tissue-specific mRNA decay. Importantly, the human counterpart of CLK-2/TEL2, TELO2, has been also implicated in the NMD, suggesting a conserved role of CLK-2/TEL2 proteins in mRNA surveillance. Recently, variants of TELO2 have been linked to an intellectual disability disorder, the You-Hoover-Fong syndrome, which could be related to its function in the NMD.
