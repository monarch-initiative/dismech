# Airway epithelial gene expression in asthma versus healthy controls

## Content

Airway epithelial brushings were obtained for microarray analysis by research bronchoscopy in 62 subjects with mild-to-moderate asthma not on inhaled steroids and 43 healthy controls. Asthma subjects were stratified into 2 subgroups, Th2 high and Th2 low asthma, based on their expression of a three-gene signature of Type 2 inflammation: POSTN, SERPINB2, and CLCA1.
