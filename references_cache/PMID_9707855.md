PIP: Dengue viral infection produces a spectrum of disease. For example, mild 
dengue disease is characterized by biphasic fever, myalgia, arthralgia, 
leukopenia, and lymphadenopathy, while dengue hemorrhagic fever is an often 
fatal disease characterized by hemorrhages and shock syndrome. The disease, 
especially in its severe form, is seen more often among children than among 
adults. With focus upon India, dengue's etiology, epidemiology, pathology, 
pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever, clinical manifestations of both the 
mild and severe forms of dengue viral infection, diagnosis, differential 
diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis are discussed.
