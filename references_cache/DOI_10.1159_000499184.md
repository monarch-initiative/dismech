## Content

<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is one of the severest and most persistent bacterial pathogens. The most frequent <i>S. aureus</i> infections include impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles, furunculosis, abscesses, hidradenitis suppurativa, and mastitis. <i>S. aureus</i> produces a great variety of cellular and extracellular factors responsible for its invasiveness and ability to cause pathological lesions. Their expression depends on the growth phase, environmental factors, and location of the infection. Susceptibility to staphylococcal infections is rooted in multiple mechanisms of host immune responses and reactions to bacterial colonization. Immunological and inflammatory processes of chronic furunculosis are based on the pathogenicity of <i>S. aureus</i> as well as innate and acquired immunity. In-depth knowledge about them may help to discover the whole pathomechanism of the disease and to develop effective therapeutic options. In this review, we focus on the <i>S. aureus</i>-host immune interactions in the pathogenesis of recurrent furunculosis according to the most recent experimental and clinical findings.
