Pathogenic variants resulting in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dysfunction 
result in mild to severe neurodevelopmental delay. PP2A is a trimer of a 
catalytic (C) subunit, scaffolding (A) subunit, and substrate binding/regulatory 
(B) subunit, encoded by 19 different genes. De novo missense variants in PPP2R5D 
(B56δ) or PPP2R1A (Aα) and de novo missense and loss-of-function variants in 
PPP2CA (Cα) lead to syndromes with overlapping phenotypic features, known as 
Houge-Janssens syndrome (HJS) types 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Here, we describe 
an additional condition in the HJS spectrum in 26 individuals with variants in 
PPP2R5C, encoding the regulatory B56γ subunit. Most changes were de novo and of 
the missense type. The clinical features were well within the HJS spectrum with 
strongest resemblance to HJS type 1, caused by B56δ variants. Common features 
were neurodevelopmental delay and hypotonia, with a high risk of epilepsy, 
behavioral problems, and mildly dysmorphic facial features. Head circumferences 
were above average or macrocephalic. The degree of intellectual disability was, 
on average, milder than in other HJS types. All variants affected either 
substrate binding (2/19), C-subunit binding (2/19), or both (15/19). Five 
variants were recurrent. Catalytic activity of the phosphatase was variably 
affected by the variants. Of note, PPP2R5C total loss-of-function variants could 
be inherited from a non-symptomatic parent. This implies that a 
dominant-negative mechanism on substrate dephosphorylation or general PP2A 
function is the most likely pathogenic mechanism.
