A 24-year-old young female presented to our hospital with gastrointestinal 
bleeding for four days. The patient had no family history of polyps or cancer. 
There were no pigment spots on her skin, lips, or oral mucosa. For diagnostic 
purposes gastroscopy and colonoscopy were all performed. Gastroscopy revealed a 
pedunculated polyp with a size of approximately 2.5 * 2.5cm in the gastric body. 
Colonoscopy showed normal. Then the polyp was excised by electrocoagulation with 
a snare. After the polyp was excised, the bleeding stopped. Histopathological 
analysis revealed that the polyp was a Peutz-Jeghers-type polyp (PJP) .
