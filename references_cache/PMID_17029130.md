Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, 
human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic 
ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis were prepared by an expert panel of the Infectious 
Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous 
treatment guidelines published in 2000 (Clin Infect Dis 2000; 31[Suppl 1]:1-14). 
The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for 
patients who either have these infections or may be at risk for them. For each 
of these Ixodes tickborne infections, information is provided about prevention, 
epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. Tables list the 
doses and durations of antimicrobial therapy recommended for treatment and 
prevention of Lyme disease and provide a partial list of therapies to be 
avoided. A definition of post-Lyme disease syndrome is proposed.
