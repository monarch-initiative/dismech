An estimated 1.7 billion (23%) of the world's population is infected with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis leading to more than 10 million new tuberculosis (TB) 
cases each year. TB is one of the top 10 causes of death globally and is the 
leading cause of death from a single infectious disease agent. The World Health 
Organization's ambitious End TB Strategy aims to achieve a 95% reduction in TB 
deaths and 90% reduction in TB incidence rates by 2035.
