PURPOSE: To describe the long-term auxological response to recombinant human 
growth hormone (rhGH) therapy in a patient with genetically confirmed 
Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) and concurrent growth hormone deficiency (GHD).
METHODS: A male pediatric patient with genetically confirmed Wolf-Hirschhorn 
syndrome underwent comprehensive endocrine evaluation. Growth hormone 
stimulation testing revealed partial GHD. He subsequently received rhGH therapy 
for 11 years, with follow-up every 6 months including auxological measurements, 
biochemical assessments, and bone age determination.
RESULTS: Across 11 years of rhGH, height improved from ~ - 4.2 to ~ - 1.3 SDS 
with normalized height velocity and a prolonged but uneventful pubertal course. 
No major adverse effects were observed. Muscle tone improvement was also noted 
with treatment initiation.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of a male 
patient with WHS and confirmed GHD who received long-term rhGH therapy, 
resulting in marked improvement in growth. These findings underscore the 
importance of routine endocrine screening for GHD in WHS. Furthermore, rhGH 
therapy may provide benefits beyond linear growth, potentially improving 
hypotonia. However, additional studies are needed to substantiate this effect.
