# Effect of epithelial depletion of Wnt10a on gene expression alteration during tooth root furcation development

## Content

In our previous study, the knockout of Wnt10a in dental epithelium resulted in the occurrence of taurodontism and root furcation defects, suggesting that epithelial Wnt10a was a pivotal signal to guide root furcation patterning. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms within dental epithelium leading root furcation development remained to be deeply elucidated. To explore the downstream molecular alterations caused by epithelial Wnt10a ablation, we conducted RNA-Seq of molar epithelium tissue from furcation region.
