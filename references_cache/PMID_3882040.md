Non-drug treatment of hypertension.

Kaplan NM.

As more people with mild hypertension are treated, non-drug therapies should be 
used more frequently and effectively. These therapies include weight reduction; 
sodium restriction; potassium, calcium, and magnesium supplementation; other 
dietary changes; exercise; relaxation; and moderation of alcohol use. Such 
therapies have been inadequately used, in part because of a lack of confidence 
in their effectiveness and overconfidence in the effectiveness and safety of 
drug therapy. Evidence about the effectiveness, mode of action, safety, and 
patient acceptance of the various non-drug therapies is reviewed, and practical 
guidelines to their use are provided. Non-drug therapies may provide enough 
antihypertensive effect to lower blood pressure of many patients with mild 
hypertension to a safe level without the need for antihypertensive drugs.
