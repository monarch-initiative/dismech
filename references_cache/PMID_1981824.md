The inability of CD4+ T cells of HIV-1-infected patients to mount an effective 
immune response is widely believed to explain the increased susceptibility of 
these patients to opportunistic infections. Although the full explanation for 
T-cell dysfunction in HIV-1 infection is not yet understood, at least two 
fundamentally distinct mechanisms are thought to contribute: depletion of CD4+ T 
cells and qualitative CD4+ T-cell dysfunction independent of T-cell depletion. 
Many HIV-1-infected patients manifest reduced T-cell responses to recall 
antigens prior to measurable CD4+ T-cell depletion, and among the proposed 
explanations for this phenomenon are gp120-mediated interference with T-cell 
activation by way of inhibition of CD4-class II major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) determinant interactions, gp41-mediated inhibition of protein kinase 
C-dependent T-cell activation, formation of gp41 cross-reactive antibodies that 
react with MHC class II determinants, transforming growth factor-beta 
(TGF-beta)-mediated immunosuppression, and decreased functions of 
antigen-presenting and antigen-processing cells (macrophages and bone 
marrow-derived dendritic cells). Despite their detection in most HIV-1-infected 
patients, these qualitative T-cell defects do not herald the onset of 
life-threatening disease. The appearance of severe clinical manifestations of 
AIDS, particularly opportunistic infections, occurs primarily in patients whose 
CD4+ T-cell count is significantly reduced. Depletion of CD4+ T cells may be a 
direct consequence of HIV-1 infection that occurs as a result of syncytia 
formation, autoantibody-mediated cytolysis, gp120-specific antibody-dependent 
cytolysis, and/or gp120-specific T-cell mediated cytolysis. The thymus is 
severely affected in patients with late-stage disease, and although there is no 
proof that the failure of the thymus to regenerate new T cells contributes to 
T-cell depletion in patients with AIDS, the likelihood seems high that this is 
the case. Indeed, if prolonged suppression of HIV-1 replication can be achieved 
with newer anti-HIV drugs or combinations of drugs, reconstitution of a normal 
immune system seems likely, provided that the capacity to regenerate T cells has 
not been irrevocably lost as a consequence of viral infection. In summary, 
available evidence indicates that HIV-1 uses a complex array of mechanisms to 
disrupt T-cell mediated immunity, but because most of these involve a direct 
role for HIV-1 proteins, such mechanisms are likely to be reversible if 
suppression of HIV-1 replication can be achieved.
