Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Clinical features 
include thyroid enlargement, eye signs, tachycardia, heat intolerance, emotional 
lability, weight loss, and hyperkinesis. Three modes of therapy are available. 
The preferences of the patient and physician are usually prime considerations in 
devising the therapeutic plan. Radioactive iodine is the most frequently used 
and safest method of treatment for adults. Antithyroid drugs are preferred for 
children and pregnant women. Surgery is usually reserved for patients in whom 
the other forms of treatment are not acceptable. Considerable patient education 
during the decision-making process enhances the success of the therapeutic plan.
