Anti-histone antibodies (AHAs) make their appearance in a number of systemic 
autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 
drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE). Although being known for over 50 years, 
they are poorly studied and understood. There is emerging evidence for their use 
in predicting clinical features of SLE, diversifying their clinical use. AHAs, 
however, are probably less prevalent in DILE than once thought owing to a move 
away from older DILE drugs to modern biological agents which do not appear to 
elicit AHAs. This review examines the historical studies that have defined AHAs 
and looks at some of the recent work with these autoantibodies.
