RATIONALE: Solitary Peutz-Jeghers polyp (SPJP) is a rare hamartomatous polyp 
that histologically mimics polyps seen in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome but occurs in 
isolation, without the associated mucocutaneous pigmentation, intestinal 
polyposis, or family history. Gastric involvement is exceedingly uncommon, with 
only 16 cases documented worldwide. This report aims to contribute a novel case 
that highlights a previously unreported clinical course for this rare entity.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old Chinese female presented with a primary 
complaint of abdominal distension.
DIAGNOSES: Recurrent gastric SPJP.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent 2 separate endoscopic submucosal dissection 
procedures. The first was for the initial resection of the antral polyp, and the 
second was performed 1 year later to remove the recurrent polyp at the original 
site.
OUTCOMES: Both endoscopic submucosal dissection procedures were completed 
successfully without any immediate or periprocedural complications. The patient 
recovered well following each intervention. The pathological diagnosis of a 
Peutz-Jeghers hamartomatous polyp was consistent after both resections.
LESSONS: This case represents the first documented instance of a recurrent 
gastric SPJP. It demonstrates that even solitary, sporadic Peutz-Jeghers polyps 
may have a potential for recurrence. Therefore, we recommend complete endoscopic 
or surgical resection of these polyps, followed by stringent endoscopic 
surveillance to facilitate the early detection and management of recurrence. 
This finding provides crucial insight for the management and follow-up strategy 
of this rare condition.
