Treatments for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are largely selected based on patient 
symptoms and echocardiographic findings. Moreover, all the advanced treatments 
for heart failure symptoms depend on such imaging for planning and monitoring 
response to therapy. Risk of sudden death correlates with maximum left 
ventricular (LV) wall thickness. Massive LV thickening of 30 mm or more is an 
indication for primary prevention of sudden death with an implanted 
defibrillator. In this review, we will underscore potential pitfalls in 
echocardiographic diagnosis. Also we will review, a newly appreciated 
pathophysiologic mechanism in obstruction dynamic systolic dysfunction due to 
gradient.
