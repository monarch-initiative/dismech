BACKGROUND: Scimitar syndrome involves congenital anomalous pulmonary venous 
return to the inferior vena cava. Optimal management remains controversial. We 
describe the natural history of disease, nonsurgical and surgical outcomes, and 
risk factors for poor outcomes at our institution.
METHODS: Patients with anomalous pulmonary venous return to the inferior vena 
cava documented on echocardiography at our institution between January 1994 and 
January 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. The study protocol IRB-AAAO1805 was 
approved.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were identified, including 20 infants with 
significant associated congenital heart defects (42.6%, including 7 with single 
ventricle physiology), and 10 infants (21.3%) and 16 noninfants (34.0%) with 
isolated scimitar syndrome. Median follow-up was 3.55 years. Noninfants 
exhibited lower incidences of right pulmonary artery hypoplasia (p < 0.001), 
aortopulmonary collaterals (p = 0.004), and scimitar vein obstruction at the 
caval confluence (p = 0.032). Eighteen patients (38.3%) underwent surgical 
repair for scimitar syndrome. Overall mortality after baffle repair or scimitar 
vein reimplantation was 37.5% (3 of 8) for infants and 0% (0 of 6) for 
noninfants (p = 0.209). Overall mortality for medically managed infants was 
46.7% (7 of 15) compared with 0% (0 of 8) for noninfants (p = 0.052). 
Multivariable analyses identified infantile onset as an independent risk factor 
for stenosis or obstruction after repair (hazard ratio 9.34, p = 0.048), and 
single ventricle physiology as an independent risk factor for mortality among 
unrepaired patients (hazard ratio 29.8, p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: The severity of scimitar syndrome depends on presenting age and 
associated congenital heart disease. Nonsurgical and surgical outcomes are 
suboptimal for infantile disease, which is a risk factor for stenosis after 
repair. Single ventricle physiology is associated with poor prognosis.
