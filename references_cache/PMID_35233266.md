Echinococcus species cause hydatidosis, which is a verminosis. Echinococcus 
vogeli results in polycystic hydatid disease, and wild dogs are the definitive 
hosts. In fact, wild dogs and rats are the most common hosts. The transit of 
Echinococcus eggs through the liver and lungs is hypothesized to result in 
hydatid cyst formation in the subcutaneous tissue. In 1.5 percent of patients 
with hydatidosis, hydatid cysts of the subcutaneous tissue have been documented. 
They ranged from 0.6 percent to 2.6 percent. We here report a case of hydatid 
cyst of the abdominal wall which was surgically treated. A 30-year-old lady had 
been experiencing pain associated with lump in her right lower abdomen for three 
months. On clinical examination, an enlargement in the left side measuring 4 x 3 
cm was discovered. Imaging was performed preoperatively to rule out other 
differential diagnoses. Ultrasound was performed, followed by computed 
tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed multilocular cystic 
mass measuring 9 x 8.5 x 4.7 cm along the right lower anterior abdominal wall 
muscles (with cysts inside cysts), which suggested hydatid cyst. Histopathology 
confirmed the diagnosis of hydatid cyst, after the mass was surgically removed. 
Treatment with albendazole was continued. Hydatid cyst of the subcutaneous 
tissue is uncommon, with only a few occurrences recorded in the literature. This 
study describes a case of hydatid cyst in an uncommon place. Imaging confirmed 
the diagnosis, and the tumour was surgically removed. It ruptured during surgery 
and was successfully treated with hypertonic saline and albendazole. Then it was 
adequately managed. Given that subcutaneous hydatid cyst is rare, it's vital to 
keep in mind that it can be a possible cause of abdominal wall mass. Specific 
imaging test is essential to correctly locate and remove it. It must be treated 
with anthelmintic before surgery, in order to reduce the risk of contamination 
due to cyst rupture during surgery. Subcutaneous hydatid cyst should be 
considered one of the differential diagnoses for soft tissue masses, in 
particular in patients living in endemic areas. To rule out alternative 
possibilities, proper imaging test is essential. The treatment of choice is 
complete excision.
