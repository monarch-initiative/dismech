OBJECTIVE: To measure, and seek clinical correlates with, levels of substance P 
(SP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) patients.
METHODS: CSF from 32 FMS patients and 30 normal control subjects was tested for 
SP by radioimmunoassay. Clinical measures included tender point examination and 
standardized questionnaires.
RESULTS: CSF SP levels were 3-fold higher in FMS patients than in normal 
controls (P < 0.001), but they correlated only weakly with tenderness found on 
examination.
CONCLUSION: SP is significantly elevated in FMS CSF, but other abnormalities 
must exist in FMS to more fully explain the symptoms.
