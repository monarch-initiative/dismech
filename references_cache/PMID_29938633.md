In 2012, The Danish Society of Respiratory Medicine gave birth to their most 
recent guideline regarding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Much 
has happened since, and in late 2017 an update has been published. Chapters have 
been deleted, and new ones added. The major alteration has been in the section 
concerning treatment with inhalation medication - now aiming at an easy stepwise 
up-titration of long-acting medicine as well as a guide of how to down-titrate 
inhaled corticosteroids. This review mainly focuses on how to treat stable COPD 
according to The Danish Society of Respiratory Medicine.
