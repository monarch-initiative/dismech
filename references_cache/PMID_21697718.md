We have shown that a variant within COL5A1, which encodes a subunit of type V 
collagen, is associated with injury and performance phenotypes. Although 
seemingly unrelated, these phenotypes are associated directly or indirectly with 
the mechanical properties of musculoskeletal soft tissue. We therefore 
hypothesize that variants in the COL5A1 gene alter fibril architecture and 
structure and, thereby, mechanical properties.
