Dengue fever, the most common arbovirus disease, affects an estimated 390 
million people annually. Dengue virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of the Flaviviridae 
family with four different serotypes. Dengue haemorrhagic fever is the deadliest 
form of dengue infection and is characterised by thrombocytopaenia, hypotension, 
and the possibility of multi-system organ failure. The mechanism hypothesised 
for DENV viral replication is intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement, which 
refers to Fcγ receptor-mediated viral amplification. This hypothesis suggests 
that the internalisation of DENV through the Fcγ receptor inhibits antiviral 
genes by suppressing type-1 interferon-mediated antiviral responses. DENV NS1 
antibodies can promote the release of various inflammatory mediators in the 
nuclear transcription factor pathway (NF-κB-dependent), including monocyte 
chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8. As a result, 
MCP-1 increases ICAM-1 expression and facilitates leukocyte transmigration. In 
addition, anti-DENV NS1 antibodies induce endothelial cell apoptosis via a 
nitric oxide-regulated pathway. A chain reaction involving pre-existing DENV 
heterotypic antibodies and innate immune cells causes dysfunction in complement 
system activity and contributes to the action of autoantibodies and 
anti-endothelial cells, resulting in endothelial cell dysfunction, blood-retinal 
barrier breakdown, haemorrhage, and plasma leakage. A spectrum of ocular 
diseases associated with DENV infection, ranging from haemorrhagic to 
inflammatory manifestations, has been reported in the literature. Although rare, 
ophthalmic manifestations can occur in both the anterior and posterior segments 
and are usually associated with thrombocytopenia. The most common ocular 
complication is haemorrhage. However, ophthalmic complications, such as anterior 
uveitis and vasculitis, suggest an immune-mediated pathogenesis.
