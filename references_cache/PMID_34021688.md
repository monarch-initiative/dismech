Arachnodactyly, a term used since 1902 to describe abnormally long (spider-like) 
fingers, is a pathologic feature of several heritable conditions, notably the 
Marfan syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly. A number of 
prominent artists, dating from the 16th to the 20th centuries, have depicted 
subjects with unusually long fingers, sometime associated with elongation of the 
body, neck and head. El Greco incorporated this style in many paintings. Little 
evidence supports any subject in any of these paintings as having a congenital 
deformity.
