Although the specific process that destroys neurons in patients with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) remains obscure, biochemical studies of AD neurohistologic lesions 
and molecular attempts to map and clone genes in familial AD have contributed 
greatly to our knowledge of AD. The major component of the extraneuronal 
neuritic plaque is beta-amyloid (A beta), which may be neurotoxic. The major 
component of the intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangle is hyperphosphorylated tau 
protein. It is unclear why this process damages the neuronal cytoskeleton 
Familial AD is genetically heterogeneous. Chromosomes 21, 14, and 1 are 
causative genes in early-onset familial AD. The apolipoprotein E4 allele of 
chromosome 19 is a risk factor for both early- and late-onset AD. Unraveling the 
actions of these three causative genes and the apolipoprotein E4 allele may 
explain disease mechanisms common to all patients with AD.
