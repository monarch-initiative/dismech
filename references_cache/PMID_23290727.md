Renal failure in type 2 diabetes has been termed "a medical catastrophe of 
worldwide dimension". In 2001, we found in our unit that 49% of incident 
patients requiring maintenance hemodialysis had diabetes (i.e. 98/million 
population/year), 6% of whom had type 1 and most (94%) had type 2 diabetes, i.e. 
more than the than reported frequency in Germany (approximately 35% of incident 
patients). The frequency is underestimated because hyperglycemia is often lost 
in the preterminal phase when diabetic patients lose weight and fasting 
hyperglycemia.
