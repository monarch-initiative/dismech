INTRODUCTION: Dieulafoy's lesion, a rare but life-threatening condition 
accounting for a small percentage of acute gastrointestinal bleeding cases, has 
historically posed diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this article, we present two cases that required surgical 
intervention due to unsuccessful attempts with endoscopy. Case 1 involved a 
40-year-old patient with a history of treated duodenal ulcers, while Case 2 
featured a 74-year-old woman with no notable medical history. Both patients 
exhibited severe bleeding, necessitating urgent surgical procedures. The 
surgical approach involved wide gastrotomy, careful inspection, and successful 
suturing of the bleeding vessel.
DISCUSSION: Dieulafoy lesions, discovered by French surgeon Georges Dieulafoy in 
1885, constitute 1-2 % of acute gastrointestinal bleeding cases. These anomalies 
involve enlarged submucosal arteries, predominantly in the stomach, but 
occurrences in other sites are documented. Endoscopic methods, surpassing 
surgical intervention, are preferred for treatment, boasting success rates over 
90 %. Surgical measures become a last resort for uncontrolled bleeding, with 
laparoscopic surgery emerging as a minimally invasive alternative, facilitated 
by various intra-operative localization techniques. Laparoscopic wedge 
resection, in particular, exhibits lower re-bleeding rates than traditional 
oversewing methods, although feasibility depends on lesion location.
CONCLUSION: While endoscopic methods are preferred, surgery remains a vital 
option when bleeding persists or endoscopic intervention fails. This report 
highlights the significance of surgical management in selected cases of 
Dieulafoy's lesion.
