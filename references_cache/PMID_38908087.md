Sepsis-associated acute lung injury (ALI) poses a significant threat, 
characterized by inflammation and oxidative damage. Effective drugs targeting 
these aspects with reliable drug delivery systems are vital for ALI management. 
This study aimed to evaluate the influence of algal polysaccharides (APs) with 
aerosolized drug delivery in ALI mice and clarify the underlying mechanism. To 
induce the sepsis-associated acute lung injury (ALI) model, mice were 
administered intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg LPS for 48 h in vivo. ALI 
mice received APs via atomization to arrive at different sites within the lungs. 
Lung tissue samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected to 
access lung injury parameters. Concurrently, western blotting, H&E staining, and 
immunofluorescence (IF) were applied to investigate the specific impact of APs 
on ALI. The results showed that APs protect lung tissue against ALI by 
inhibiting inflammation and mitigating oxidative stress-induced damage. This 
study highlights promising avenues for ALI intervention using natural compounds 
with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
