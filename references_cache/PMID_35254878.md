Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an endocrine disorder in which pancreatic β 
cells stop producing insulin, typically due to autoimmune destruction. This 
results in hyperglycemia and ketosis; thus, insulin replacement is vital to 
management. Incidence peaks in puberty and early adulthood, but onset can occur 
at any age. However, prevalence is highest among adults because persons with 
T1DM live for many years. Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, and weight 
loss. Acute complications include diabetic ketoacidosis, which requires urgent 
management. Long-term complications include microvascular and macrovascular 
disease. Patients with T1DM are at higher risk for other autoimmune diseases and 
psychosocial issues. Management should focus on optimizing glucose control to 
reduce acute and long-term complications.
