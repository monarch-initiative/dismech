Bejel or nonvenereal syphilis is a treponemal infection that is still endemic in 
many parts of the world including Saudi Arabia. The authors have examined 17 
patients with clinical findings consistent with bejel. All patients had positive 
serologic tests for bejel. There were 11 male and six female patients, with a 
mean age of 54 years (range, 37-73 years). Results of clinical examination 
showed uveitis in nine patients, optic atrophy in six, and chorioretinitis scars 
in six. In four patients who needed intraocular surgery, two aqueous specimens 
showed positive antibodies for Treponema pallidum.
