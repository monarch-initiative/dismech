The three main soil-transmitted helminth infections, ascariasis, trichuriasis, 
and hookworm, are common clinical disorders in man. The gastrointestinal tract 
of a child living in poverty in a less developed country is likely to be 
parasitised with at least one, and in many cases all three soil-transmitted 
helminths, with resultant impairments in physical, intellectual, and cognitive 
development. The benzimidazole anthelmintics, mebendazole and albendazole, are 
commonly used to remove these infections. The use of these drugs is not limited 
to treatment of symptomatic soil-transmitted helminth infections, but also for 
large-scale prevention of morbidity in children living in endemic areas. As a 
result of data showing improvements in child health and education after 
deworming, and the burden of disease attributed to soil-transmitted helminths, 
the worldwide community is awakening to the importance of these infections. 
Concerns about the sustainability of periodic deworming with benzimidazole 
anthelmintics and the emergence of resistance have prompted efforts to develop 
and test new control tools.
