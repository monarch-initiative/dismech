Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is thought to be the second most common form of 
dementia after Alzheimer’s disease, and is characterised by a combination of 
cognitive, neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms. The present review seeks to 
discuss current strategies for the management of DLB, and future directions for 
novel disease-modifying therapies. Current best practice for the clinical 
management of DLB is based upon therapies that target specific symptom domains 
due to the lack of disease-modifying therapies. Cholinesterase inhibitors are 
the frontline treatment for treating cognitive decline in DLB, whereas the 
treatment of motor symptoms remains challenging due to poor response to 
dopaminergic therapies and the potential for exacerbation of neuropsychiatric 
features. There is emerging evidence suggesting a range of further 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies may be effective in treating 
specific symptom domains of DLB, but further evidence is warranted to 
demonstrate their efficacy. A key challenge in the treatment of DLB is 
incomplete understanding of disease pathophysiology, which has limited attempts 
to develop disease-modifying therapies. In the present article, we discuss the 
multi-faceted nature of DLB neuropathology, from Lewy body pathology to 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and discuss therapies in development that target 
particular aspects of DLB neuropathology. In particular, we highlight 
antibody-based therapies to attenuate protein aggregation, compounds that 
enhance the generation of cellular energy and autophagy-enhancing agents as 
particular areas of promise. Furthermore, we discuss how optimal strategies for 
disease modification will be centred on agents that treat DLB neuropathology 
more holistically, and will be underpinned by a more complete understanding of 
the pathogenic events that underlie the full spectrum of pathological changes 
observed in the DLB brain.
