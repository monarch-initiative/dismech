This historical summary follows the major conceptual developments of the 
cohesive rather than the fractionated view of the disease, named after Pick. 
Clinical and biologic evidence in favor the entity is discussed. The changing 
and proliferating knowledge and terminology requires the integration of several 
levels of descriptions, while keeping the work in the past in sight. A 
historical perspective helps to prevent the chaos of terminological confusion 
and reinventing the wheel.
