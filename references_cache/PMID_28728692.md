BACKGROUND: Cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is an increasingly 
recognized cause of heart failure. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), with late 
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T1 mapping, is emerging as a reference standard 
for diagnosis and characterization of cardiac amyloidosis.
OBJECTIVES: The authors used CMR with extracellular volume fraction (ECV) 
measurement to characterize cardiac involvement in relation to outcome in ATTR.
METHODS: Subjects comprised 263 patients with cardiac ATTR corroborated by grade 
2 to 3 99mTc-DPD (99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid) cardiac 
uptake, 17 with suspected cardiac ATTR (grade 1 99mTc-DPD), and 12 asymptomatic 
individuals with amyloidogenic transthyretin (TTR) mutations. Fifty patients 
with cardiac light-chain (AL) amyloidosis acted as disease comparators.
RESULTS: Unlike cardiac AL amyloidosis, asymmetrical septal left ventricular 
hypertrophy (LVH) was present in 79% of patients with ATTR (70% sigmoid septum 
and 30% reverse septal contour), whereas symmetrical LVH was present in 18%, and 
3% had no LVH. In patients with cardiac amyloidosis, the pattern of LGE was 
always typical for amyloidosis (29% subendocardial, 71% transmural), including 
right ventricular LGE (96%). During follow-up (19 ± 14 months), 65 patients 
died. ECV independently correlated with mortality and remained independent after 
adjustment for age, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, ejection 
fraction, E/E', and left ventricular mass (hazard ratio: 1.164; 95% confidence 
interval: 1.066 to 1.271; p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetrical hypertrophy, traditionally associated with 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was the commonest pattern of ventricular remodeling 
in ATTR. LGE imaging was typical in all patients with cardiac ATTR. 
ECV correlated with amyloid burden and was an independent prognostic factor for 
survival in this cohort of patients.
