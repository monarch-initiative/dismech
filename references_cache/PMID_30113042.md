Melanoma rates have increased in populations that are mainly European. The main 
etiologic factor is ultraviolet radiation, from the sun as well as artificial 
tanning devices. Host factors such as skin color, number of nevi, hair and eye 
color and tanning ability are critical factors in modifying an individual's 
response to the sun. Genetic factors interact with host factors and 
environmental factors to increase risk. This review summarizes our current 
knowledge of environment and genetics on melanoma risk and on gene-environment 
interaction.
