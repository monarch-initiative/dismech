Nephrotoxicity of nitrosoureas.

Schacht RG, Feiner HD, Gallo GR, Lieberman A, Baldwin DS.

Irreversible and progressive renal parenchymal damage and functional impairment 
occurred in the majority of patients receiving at least six courses (200 mg/m2 
of BCNU and/or methyl CCNU at eight-week intervals) of nitrosoureas for therapy 
of malignant brain tumors. Seventeen of 18 patients who received at least six 
courses and all nine patients who received more than ten courses developed 
impaired renal function as judged by elevation of blood urea nitrogen and/or 
serum creatinine or decrease in filtration rate as determined by inulin 
clearance. Four patients have developed uremia. Renal tissue obtained from seven 
patients demonstrated tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and glomerular 
sclerosis. This remarkably high incidence of renal damage occurred without a 
phase of acute renal failure and in the absence of significant urinary 
abnormalities, while producing an insidiously progressive interstitial renal 
lesion.
