The relative risk for melanoma arising within a congenital nevus is related to 
the size of the lesion. The timing of and clinical presentation of development 
of melanoma is also related to the size of the lesion. Medical decisions are 
individualized taking into account the perceived risk of malignancy, 
psychosocial impact, and anticipated treatment outcome. In this article, the 
common features of congenital nevi are discussed as well as the potential 
individual variations and their impact on treatment recommendations.
