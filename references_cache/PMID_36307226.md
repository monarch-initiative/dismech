BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: KCNH5 encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel 
EAG2/Kv10.2. We aimed to delineate the neurodevelopmental and epilepsy 
phenotypic spectrum associated with de novo KCNH5 variants.
METHODS: We screened 893 individuals with developmental and epileptic 
encephalopathies for KCNH5 variants using targeted or exome sequencing. 
Additional individuals with KCNH5 variants were identified through an 
international collaboration. Clinical history, EEG, and imaging data were 
analyzed; seizure types and epilepsy syndromes were classified. We included 3 
previously published individuals including additional phenotypic details.
RESULTS: We report a cohort of 17 patients, including 9 with a recurrent de novo 
missense variant p.Arg327His, 4 with a recurrent missense variant p.Arg333His, 
and 4 additional novel missense variants. All variants were located in or near 
the functionally critical voltage-sensing or pore domains, absent in the general 
population, and classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic using the American 
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria. All individuals presented 
with epilepsy with a median seizure onset at 6 months. They had a wide range of 
seizure types, including focal and generalized seizures. Cognitive outcomes 
ranged from normal intellect to profound impairment. Individuals with the 
recurrent p.Arg333His variant had a self-limited drug-responsive focal or 
generalized epilepsy and normal intellect, whereas the recurrent p.Arg327His 
variant was associated with infantile-onset DEE. Two individuals with variants 
in the pore domain were more severely affected, with a neonatal-onset movement 
disorder, early-infantile DEE, profound disability, and childhood death.
DISCUSSION: We describe a cohort of 17 individuals with pathogenic or likely 
pathogenic missense variants in the voltage-sensing and pore domains of Kv10.2, 
including 14 previously unreported individuals. We present evidence for a 
putative emerging genotype-phenotype correlation with a spectrum of epilepsy and 
cognitive outcomes. Overall, we expand the role of EAG proteins in human disease 
and establish KCNH5 as implicated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders 
and epilepsy.
