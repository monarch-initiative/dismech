Digital twins offer a promising approach to advancing healthcare by providing 
precise, noninvasive monitoring and early detection of diseases. In heart 
failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality worldwide, they can improve patient 
monitoring and clinical outcomes by simulating hemodynamic changes indicative of 
worsening HF. Current techniques are limited by their invasiveness and lack of 
scalability. We present a novel framework for HF digital twins that predicts 
patient-specific hemodynamic metrics in the pulmonary arteries using 3D 
computational fluid dynamics to address these limitations. We introduce a 
strategy to determine the minimal geometric complexity required for accurate 
pressure prediction and explore the effects of varying boundary conditions. By 
validating our digital twins against invasively-measured data, we demonstrate 
their potential to improve HF management by enabling continuous, noninvasive 
monitoring and early identification of worsening HF. This proof-of-concept study 
lays the groundwork for integrating digital twin technology into personalized HF 
care.
