RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF VIBRIO CHOLERAE BY DARKFIELD MICROSCOPY.

BENENSON AS, ISLAM MR, GREENOUGH WB 3rd.

This article describes a rapid, simple and reproducible method for detecting 
Vibrio cholerae in diarrhoeal patients. The method involves darkfield 
examination of a liquid stool specimen or a rectal swab immersed in broth and 
immobilization of V. cholerae by the addition of specific vibrio antisera. The 
authors state that in 80% of cases a definitive diagnosis is available within 
five minutes. There is no need for elaborate equipment or long training of 
technicians and the method is easily performed by one person in the field.
