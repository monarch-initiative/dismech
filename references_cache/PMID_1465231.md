Cholera is a diarrheal disease that results from colonization of the small 
intestine by the Vibrio cholerae organism. The disease is spread primarily by 
means of fecal contamination of drinking water and may begin with the sudden 
onset of profuse, watery diarrhea. Vomiting, rapid dehydration, acidosis, 
muscular cramps and circulatory collapse are other prominent features of severe 
cholera. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the organism in a stool 
specimen. Treatment requires immediate replacement of the massive fluid loss 
before diagnostic studies are ordered. Clinicians should suspect cholera in any 
case of massive, shock-producing diarrhea, especially if the patient has 
traveled to a cholera-affected country. This article presents epidemiology and 
public-health measures, pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms, 
and treatment modalities for adults and children infected with the V. cholerae 
organism.
