BACKGROUND: Wilms tumour is the most common paediatric renal malignancy. The RNA 
demethylase alkylation repair homologue protein 5 (ALKBH5), known for its role 
in reversing N6-methyladenosine modification, has been increasingly implicated 
in tumourigenesis. Its specific role in Wilms tumour, however, remains largely 
unexplored. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association 
between ALKBH5 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to Wilms tumour.
METHODS: Our study included 416 patients and 936 cancer-free controls from East 
China. We genotyped two ALKBH5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms: rs1378602 
G>A and rs8400 G>A.
RESULTS: We found that the rs8400 AA genotype was significantly associated with 
an increased risk of Wilms tumour compared with GG/GA carriers (adjusted 
OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.85, p=0.025). Furthermore, individuals carrying two 
risk genotypes faced a significantly higher risk than those with zero or one 
risk genotype (adjusted OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.92, p=0.017). Stratified 
analysis revealed that this elevated risk was particularly pronounced in 
specific subgroups: children older than 18 months, females and those diagnosed 
with clinical stages I and II.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the ALKBH5 rs8400 G>A polymorphism is 
associated with increased susceptibility to Wilms tumour in the Eastern Chinese 
paediatric population.
