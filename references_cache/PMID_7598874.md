There now exists a vast literature on Ménière's disease. In this review, we 
examine closely the foundations of some of the current concepts regarding 
various aspects of the disorder, including definitions, clinical features, 
natural history, pathology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, diagnosis and 
treatment. We will highlight areas where the current state of knowledge is 
incomplete and also suggest some avenues for further research.
