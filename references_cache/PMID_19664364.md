TAR DNA-binding protein of about 43 kDa (TDP-43) is the main ubiquitinated 
peptide in tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). TDP-43 is 
typically a nuclear protein, and its aggregation and cytoplasmic translocation 
are thought to represent major steps in the pathogenesis of FTLD due to TDP-43 
proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP). Certain clinical syndromes of frontotemporal dementia 
are preferentially associated with pathologic findings of FTLD-TDP, and TDP-43 
pathology represents the connection between FTLD-TDP and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. Recent advances in clinical, genetic, and pathologic studies of 
FTLD-TDP and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have shed light on the potentially 
pathogenic role of TDP-43 and identified TDP-43 itself as a candidate biomarker 
for antemortem diagnosis of FTLD-TDP.
