OBJECTIVE: A number of studies have documented that acculturation to western 
society is related to an increase in blood pressure (BP). Although there is 
evidence that higher socioeconomic status appears related to better 
cardiovascular health, increasing acculturation to western society appears 
related to worse cardiovascular health. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to 
investigate the association between acculturation and BP.
METHODS: Literature searches yielded 125 relevant research manuscripts, which 
were coded by teams of two independent raters. This study was conducted in 2003 
and 2004, and research databases such as MEDLINE and PsychINFO were searched 
through 2004. Measures of association (effect sizes) were extracted for both 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings. 
Random effects models were used to analyze the resulting data.
RESULTS: The overall effect sizes associated with acculturation were 0.28 for 
SBP and 0.30 for DBP, with increasing acculturation to western society related 
to higher BP. More acculturated individuals had an average of 4 mm Hg higher BP 
than less acculturated individuals, which is similar to the effect sizes of 
known risk factors for high BP such as diet and physical activity. The effects 
of acculturation on BP appear to be universal, with similar effect sizes found 
across all regions of the world. Change in BP due to acculturation was not 
related to body mass index (BMI) or cholesterol but was related to length of 
residence in the new culture, with the largest effect sizes seen on initial 
entry and then decreasing rapidly within the first few years. Sudden cultural 
changes, such as migration from rural to urban settings, resulted in the largest 
effect sizes, which finding supports the hypothesis that the stress of cultural 
change is important role in the acculturation effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Acculturation to western society is associated with higher BP, and 
the distress associated with cultural change appears to be more influential than 
changes in diet or physical activity. Future studies would benefit from 
investigating how cultural change affects health and examining whether some 
non-Western cultural values and practices are health protective.
