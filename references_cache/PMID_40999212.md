BACKGROUND: Families confronting the death of a loved one in the intensive care 
unit (ICU) are at greater risk of experiencing complicated grief than families 
bereaved in other circumstances. The primary objective of this scoping review 
was to identify interventions that have been explored in the literature for 
supporting ICU bereaved families. Secondary objectives were to map the findings 
to a core outcome set (COS) developed to measure bereavement interventions for 
adults, and to identify existing knowledge gaps, with particular attention to 
considerations of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI).
METHODS: We searched five electronic databases: Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE, 
APA PsycInfo, and MEDLINE. Primary research articles that described bereavement 
program(s) and/or support(s) for bereaved loved ones in the setting of an adult 
ICU were included. We extracted data on study aims, methods, setting, patient 
and bereaved loved one demographics, design, analysis, and results. Four 
reviewers independently screened references and performed data extraction.
FINDINGS: We identified 11 bereavement interventions, including memorial 
services, condolence letters/sympathy cards, mementos, ICU diaries completed by 
staff or family, storytelling interventions, personalized/individual final 
wishes, information booklets/referrals to resources, meetings with ICU 
professionals, follow up telephone calls, training for staff, and other specific 
interventions. Most studies (35 out of 39) reported outcomes that aligned with a 
previously developed COS. Only three studies addressed cultural diversity in the 
development or implementation of bereavement interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review summarizes the range of bereavement 
interventions described in the literature and highlights key areas for future 
development, including cultural inclusivity in the development and 
implementation of interventions, and the use of standardized outcomes for 
evaluation.
