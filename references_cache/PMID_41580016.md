Dysfunction of the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway, which is mediated by 
the formation of the PML-RARA fusion gene, plays a central role in the 
pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The activation of this 
pathway depends on the binding of the ligand retinoic acid (RA) to RA receptors 
(RARs). Members of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family are key enzymes 
responsible for the biosynthesis of endogenous RA and are highly enriched in 
various cancer stem cell subpopulations; however, their specific contributions 
to APL pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that 
the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase family member 1A3 (ALDH1A3) is 
negatively correlated with APL progression. Through DNA pull-down assays, liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC‒MS/MS) analysis, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP), dual-luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic 
mobility shift assay (EMSA), we show that ALDH1A3 cooperates with the 
transcription factor MAZ to transcriptionally repress PML-RARα expression. 
Furthermore, EMSA and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) analyses reveal 
that PML-RARα increases methylation of the ALDH1A3 promoter, thereby suppressing 
its expression in APL patients. This reciprocal inhibitory relationship is 
correlated with clinical remission in APL. Integrated RNA-seq and ATAC-seq 
analyses indicate that ALDH1A3 overexpression is associated with increased 
chromatin accessibility and the upregulation of genes involved in cellular 
differentiation. Notably, demethylation therapy induced sustained complete 
remission in patients with refractory recurrent APL during experimental 
treatment. Our findings underscore the critical role of ALDH1A3 in 
leukemogenesis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in APL.
