Asthma is characterised by airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation and 
airway remodelling. Airway smooth muscle cells are known to be the main effector 
cells of airway narrowing. In the present paper, studies will be discussed that 
have led to a novel view of the role of airway smooth muscle in the pathogenesis 
of asthma in which airway hyperresponsiveness, remodelling and inflammation are, 
at least in part, attributable to airway smooth muscle. Furthermore, how this 
new view may lead to a change in the phenotyping and treatment of patients with 
asthma will be discussed.
