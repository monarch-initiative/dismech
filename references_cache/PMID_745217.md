Taurodontism and Klinefelter's syndrome.

Komatz Y, Tomoyoshi T, Yoshida O, Fujimoto A, Yoshitake K.

The incidence of taurodontism in 31 patients with XXY Klinefelter's syndrome was 
studied. Taurodont molars were observed in 6 of the 31 cases (19.4%), a 
significantly higher rate than among the controls. Though taurodontism is not an 
obligatory finding in Klinefelter's syndrome, it is believed to be one of the 
anomalies frequently observed in connection with this condition.
