# Smartphone Delivery of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Post-intensive Care Syndrome-Family: A Pilot Study

## Content

Family members of critically ill (ICU) patients are at risk for developing significant symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress during and after the ICU experience. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a form of therapy that can help individuals cope with stressful events in a more active and effective way. This study will examine the effectiveness of a smartphone self-care app delivering cognitive behavioral therapy in decreasing the psychological symptoms suffered by ICU family members. Half of the sample will receive the self-care app and half of the study sample will receive the usual supportive care given to family members of ICU patients. The researchers anticipate the self-care app will diminish the severity of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms experienced by ICU family members.
