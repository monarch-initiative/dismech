The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) comprise 12 autosomal recessive 
complementation groups (CGs). The multisystem clinical phenotype varies widely 
in severity and results from disturbances in both development and metabolic 
homeostasis. Progress over the last several years has lead to identification of 
the genes responsible for all of these disorders and to a much improved 
understanding of the biogenesis and function of the peroxisome. Increasing 
availability of mouse models for these disorders offers hope for a better 
understanding of their pathophysiology and for development of therapies that 
might especially benefit patients at the milder end of the clinical phenotype.
