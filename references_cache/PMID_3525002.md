Radiology of Meckel's diverticulum.

Ghahremani GG.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 2 to 3% of all individuals have a Meckel's 
diverticulum and one third of them experience clinical symptoms. Until a decade 
ago, the correct diagnosis of the lesion was rarely established prior to 
abdominal surgery or autopsy. However, the introduction of modern imaging 
techniques and the refinement of gastrointestinal contrast studies have 
facilitated the preoperative recognition of this entity. This article reviews 
the radiographic pathology of Meckel's diverticulum and the spectrum of its 
associated complications.
