Serum samples were analysed for the presence of (a) IgG against VP1+VP2 using 
recombinant native conformational antigens by ELISA test (b) IgG against VP2 
using recombinant native conformational antigens by ELISA test and (c) IgG 
against VP1 and against VP2 using denatured linear antigens by Western blot. Out 
of the 446 samples examined, 353 were positive for specific B19 IgG and out of 
these, 98.6 % proved positive in the ELISA assay using conformational VP1+VP2 
antigens, 94.6% proved positive in the ELISA assay using conformational VP2 
antigens, 89.5% were positive at the Western blot assay using denatured linear 
VP1 and VP2 antigens, with all proving positive for linear VP1 and only 29.5% 
out of the positive samples proving positive for linear VP2. Since all samples 
positive by Western blot proved positive by ELISA, our data show that 
recombinant capsids obtained either with VP1+VP2 or with VP2 alone, used in 
ELISA, are very useful for detecting the immune response against both 
conformational and native linear epitopes of B19 structural proteins although 
some sera may have antibodies directed exclusively against VP1+VP2 antigens and 
few may have antibodies directed exclusively against VP2 antigens alone.
