BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is an established predictor of 
cardiovascular risk but associations with secondary events are less certain, and 
data on understudied ethnic groups are scarce. This study aimed to assess the 
association between Lp(a) and secondary events and explore variation in Lp(a) 
levels by ethnicity in first-time acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, to 
inform future risk prediction models.
METHODS: The Multi-Ethnic New Zealand Study of Acute Coronary Syndromes 
(MENZACS) is a longitudinal multi-centre cohort study of 1900 patients enrolled 
during their ACS admission. Baseline plasma Lp(a) concentrations were measured 
using an isoform-insensitive assay measured in nmol/L. The primary outcome was a 
composite of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular readmission, ascertained 
through national health datasets. Cox regression models were used to assess the 
association between Lp(a) levels and outcomes, adjusted for clinical risk 
factors.
RESULTS: The mean age was 61 years, 20 % were female, and 73 % were European, 
14 % Māori, 5 % Pacific peoples, 4 % Indian and 3 % other ethnicities. Of 1890 
alive at discharge, 493 (26 %) experienced the primary outcome over a median 
follow-up of 4.9 years. Higher Lp(a) levels were associated with increased risk 
of secondary events. Compared to the lowest quartile (≤7 nmol/L), the adjusted 
hazard ratio for the highest quartile (>92 nmol/L) was 1.46 (95 %CI 1.12-1.89, 
p = 0.004). In this ACS cohort, Lp(a) concentrations varied by ethnicity, being 
highest amongst Indian participants (median 27 nmol/L) and lowest amongst Māori 
participants (median 12 nmol/L).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated Lp(a) concentrations are associated with secondary events 
following ACS. Further research is needed to define optimal thresholds for 
increased risk and explore ethnic-specific implications for secondary 
prevention.
