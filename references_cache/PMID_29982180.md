Pathogenic variants in the lysyl-hydroxylase-1 gene (PLOD1) are responsible for 
the kyphoscoliotic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The disease is 
classically responsible for severe hypotonia at birth, progressive 
kyphoscoliosis, generalised joint hypermobility and scleral fragility. Arterial 
fragility is an important feature of the disease, but its characterisation 
remains limited. We report the clinical history of a 41-year-old woman who 
presented repeated arterial accidents, which occurred in previously normal 
medium size arteries within a limited time span of 2 years. Molecular 
investigations revealed compound heterozygosity for two PLOD1 gene deletions of 
exons 11-12 and 14-15. Arterial fragility is an important characteristic of 
kyphoscoliotic EDS. It manifests as spontaneous arterial rupture, dissections 
and dissecting aneurysms which may occur even during early childhood. This 
fragility is particularly likely to manifest during surgical intervention. Early 
medical management and surveillance may be indicated, but its modalities remain 
to be defined.
