OBJECTIVE: To develop optimal search strategies in Medline for retrieving sound 
clinical studies on the diagnosis of health disorders.
DESIGN: Analytical survey.
SETTING: Medline, 2000.
PARTICIPANTS: 170 journals for 2000 of which 161 were indexed in Medline.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The sensitivity, specificity, precision ("positive 
predictive value"), and accuracy of 4862 unique terms in 17,287 combinations 
were determined by comparison with a hand search of all articles (the "gold 
standard") in 161 journals published during 2000 (49,028 articles).
RESULTS: Only 147 (18.9%) of 778 articles about diagnostic tests met basic 
criteria for scientific merit. Combinations of search terms reached peak 
sensitivities of 98.6% at a specificity of 74.3%. Compared with best single 
terms, best multiple terms increased sensitivity for sound studies by 6.8% 
(absolute increase), while also increasing specificity (absolute increase 6.0%) 
when sensitivity was maximised. When terms were combined to maximise 
specificity, the single term, specificity.tw. (98.4%), outperformed combinations 
of terms. The strategies newly reported in this paper outperformed other 
validated search strategies except for one strategy that had slightly higher 
sensitivity (99.3% v 98.6%) but lower specificity (54.7% v 74.3%).
CONCLUSION: New empirical search strategies in Medline can optimise retrieval of 
articles reporting high quality clinical studies of diagnosis.
