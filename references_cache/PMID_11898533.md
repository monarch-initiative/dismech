Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with tremendous variability and innumerable 
symptoms. Among the more common symptoms is spasticity. Despite a lack of full 
knowledge of the physiology causing this phenomenon, successful treatments have 
been developed. Many of these have had a recent introduction. Pain and 
paroxysmal phenomena are surprisingly common in MS, but have not had the 
recognition their frequency deserves. It is not unusual to hear that they are 
rare in MS, but surprisingly they are all too common. Their management is 
changing as newer treatments are developed.
