Meckel-Gruber syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive lethal malformation 
characterized by typical manifestations of occipital encephalocele, bilateral 
polycystic kidneys and post axial polydactyly. The worldwide incidence varies 
from 1 in 13,250 to 1 in 140,000 live births. Highest incidence was reported in 
Gujarati Indians. We report a rare case of Meckel-Gruber syndrome and review of 
literature.
