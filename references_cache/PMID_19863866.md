In patients with hypertension, pressure overload leads to left ventricular 
hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial fibrosis, and impaired diastolic filling without 
systolic dysfunction. Presently, diastolic heart failure accounts for about 50% 
of the heart failure population. Fatigue, dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, 
and peripheral edema are common presenting complaints. As a group, patients with 
diastolic heart failure are older and predominantly female. Diuretics are 
effective for treating congestive symptoms. beta Blockers and heart 
rate-lowering calcium blockers show benefit in smaller studies but have not been 
evaluated in definitive clinical trials. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
blockers reduce blood pressure, LVH, and myocardial fibrosis; however, long-term 
studies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 
blockers demonstrate little effect on symptoms or survival, and inconsistent 
effects on heart failure hospitalization. At present, evidence-based treatment 
includes antihypertensive therapy to reduce progression from hypertension to 
heart failure. In patients with established heart failure, diuretics and other 
empiric treatments are used to control symptoms.
