# Single cell RNA sequencing of lung adenocarcinoma

## Content

We performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) for 208,506 cells derived from 58 lung adenocarcinomas from 44 patients, which covers primary tumour, lymph node and brain metastases, and pleural effusion in addition to normal lung tissues and lymph nodes. The extensive single cell profiles depicted a complex cellular atlas of lung adenocarcinoma progression which includes cancer, stromal, and immune cells in the surrounding tumor microenvironments.
