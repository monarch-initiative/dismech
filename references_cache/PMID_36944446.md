TARP (talipes equinovarus, atrial septal defect (ASD), Robin sequence, 
persistent left superior vena cava) syndrome is a rare X-linked disorder 
affecting the RBM10 gene. It was previously viewed as universally fatal in the 
early neonatal period, however, recent cases have shown patients surviving 
beyond this stage. We present a male toddler diagnosed with TARP syndrome due to 
a a previously unreported splicing mutation c.2295+1G>A in the RBM10 gene. At 
birth, he had an ASD and Robin sequence, two of the eponymous features, as well 
as other associated phenotypic features. During infancy, he had an extremely 
high alpha-fetoprotein, conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and thrombocytopaenia, 
features not previously described in TARP syndrome. We discuss these findings as 
well as our patient's survival past the neonatal period with special 
consideration to recent genotype-phenotypes correlations.
