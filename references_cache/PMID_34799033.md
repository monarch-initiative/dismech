Patients are commonly referred to pediatric dermatology for the evaluation of 
pigmented lesions. For families, pediatricians, and dermatologists alike, 
malignancy is the main fear. In the past few decades, there has been evolving 
literature to inform diagnosis and management. This article provides an update 
on the clinical, histopathologic, and ancillary testing for 3 categories of 
particularly challenging pigmented lesions: congenital melanocytic nevi, 
spitzoid neoplasms, and pediatric melanoma.
