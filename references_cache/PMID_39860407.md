Background/Objectives: Cancer immunotherapy through the use of PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitors have shown significant promise in endometrial carcinoma (EC), 
particularly in tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) or mismatch repair 
deficiency (dMMR), present in approximately 30% of cases. This review evaluated 
PD-L1 and PD-1 expression as potential biomarkers for immunotherapy response in 
EC, focusing on their relationship with MSI status. Methods: A systematic 
review, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, analyzed studies from MEDLINE and Embase 
until February 2023 on PD-1/PD-L1 expression in EC stratified by MSI status, 
including diverse study designs but excluding conference abstracts, with 
independent screening, data extraction, and additional reference checks to 
ensure comprehensive coverage. Results: A systematic analysis of 10 studies 
found that PD-L1 expression was more frequently expressed in MSI tumors (49%) 
compared to microsatellite-stable tumors (MSS) (33.5%), while PD-1 was expressed 
in 58% of MSI cases and 48% of MSS cases. Despite these findings, the prognostic 
value of PD-L1/PD-1 remains uncertain, with conflicting results regarding their 
association with survival outcomes. PD-L1 expression varied across molecular 
subtypes, being highest in POLE-mutated tumors (76.56%) and serous carcinomas 
(73%). Differences in PD-L1 expression between primary and metastatic sites were 
also noted, complicating its use as a biomarker. Conclusions: The assessment of 
PD-L1 expression in EC could represent a valuable option for selecting patients 
who may benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), including those in the 
MSS cohort, thereby ensuring a more tailored and personalized treatment 
strategy.
