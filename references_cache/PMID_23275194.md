Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a common inherited 
disorder worldwide including southern China. G6PD gene mutations cause 
deficiency of the enzyme and a large spectrum of diseases. High-resolution DNA 
melting (HRM) assay was recently introduced as a rapid, inexpensive and 
effective method for genotyping. But there was a shortcoming of this method that 
hemizygous and homozygous genotypes were not easily distinguished from 
wild-types. Here we used improved HRM method for a small-scale screening of 
G6PD-deficient variants among people of Meizhou region. Then all amplicons were 
ascertained by direct DNA sequencing. These results indicated that HRM method 
was a major technical advance for G6PD mutations screening.
