For most autoimmune disorders, the pattern of inheritance is very complex. The 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene complex has been implicated as the 
major genetic component in the predisposition to these diseases but other genes 
are likely to be involved. Based on function and experimental data, the gene 
encoding cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) has been suggested 
as a candidate gene for conferring susceptibility to autoimmunity. In this 
review, we critically evaluate the evidence for pathogenetical involvement of 
CTLA-4 in the different autoimmune diseases with focus on the possible role of 
genetic variation of the CTLA4 locus.
