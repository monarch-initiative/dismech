Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetic disorder caused by the dysfunction of 
the primary cilium. To date, immunological defects in the disease have not been 
systematically assessed. In this issue, Tsyklauri and colleagues find, through 
detailed analysis of BBS mutant animals, that B-cell development is altered in 
mutant mice (Tsyklauri et al, 2021). The authors further report that BBS 
patients are more susceptible to autoimmune disorders. This study sheds new 
light on the potential role of primary cilia in controlling immune function in 
disease.
