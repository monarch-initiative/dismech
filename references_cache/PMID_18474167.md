Chromosomal abnormalities are important cause of mental retardation and 
congenital anomalies. We report a case of a rare chromosomal disorder, 
Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, caused by deletion of short arm of chromosome 4. It 
was characterized by well-described facial appearance, seizures, microcephaly 
and midline closure defects along with growth and mental retardation.
