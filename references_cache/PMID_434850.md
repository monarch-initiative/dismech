Localized Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Cullen SI.

A 34-year-old woman had the cutaneous features of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 
which was strictly limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissue in the region of 
the left shoulder. The disorder started at approximately age 22 with the 
development of subcutaneous nodules. Hyperextensibility of the skin in this 
region developed within the subsequent five years. There was a notable lack of 
the usually associated joint hyperextensibility, bleeding tendency, scar 
formation, or the serious systemic components of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
