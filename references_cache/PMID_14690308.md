Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant cervical tumor, but the 
incidence of adenocarcinomas has been rising during the past few decades. This 
article discusses the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the squamous cell 
carcinoma, its clinical and histologic features, including microinvasive 
carcinoma, its histologic grade, and variant tumors. The prognostic impact of 
these features and the differential diagnosis are also covered. The second 
portion of this article is devoted to the glandular tumors of the cervix, 
including adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma and its variants. 
The differential diagnosis of these tumors with tumor like glandular lesions is 
given special attention. Finally, less common malignant cervical tumors are 
covered, with an emphasis being placed on their significance.
