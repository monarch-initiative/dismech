Joint hypermobility may be syndromic or nonsyndromic, asymptomatic or 
symptomatic. However, asymptomatic joint hypermobility can cause repetitive use 
injury, alter biomechanics, or become symptomatic later in life. Symptomatic 
joint hypermobility can result from soft tissue injury or muscular strain caused 
by muscular imbalance. Treatment is straightforward once joint hypermobility is 
recognized. Generalized joint hypermobility can be assessed using a standardized 
in-office examination. Generalized joint hypermobility may also be a feature of 
a heritable connective tissue disorder with other systemic findings. Therefore, 
assessing joint hypermobility in the context of musculoskeletal complaints may 
lead to recognizing systemic manifestations and allow treatment accordingly.
