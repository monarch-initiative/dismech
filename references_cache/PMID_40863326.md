Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) imposes a significant burden on global public 
health. Exposure to aflatoxins, potent mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fungi 
contaminating staple foods, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are 
major etiological factors, especially where they co-exist. This review examines 
the critical role of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway as a primary target and 
convergence point for the carcinogenic actions of aflatoxins and HBV. Aflatoxin 
B1 (AFB1), a Group 1 carcinogen, exerts significant genotoxicity, 
characteristically inducing a specific hotspot mutation (R249S) in the TP53 gene 
via DNA adduct formation, thereby compromising p53's critical tumor suppressor 
functions. This R249S mutation is considered a molecular fingerprint of 
aflatoxin exposure. Concurrently, the HBV X protein (HBx) functionally 
inactivates wild-type p53 through direct binding and by promoting its 
degradation. The synergistic disruption of the p53 pathway, driven by 
AFB1-induced mutation and amplified by HBV-mediated functional inhibition, 
significantly enhances the risk of HCC development. This review addresses how 
aflatoxin exposure alters key aspects of p53 and how this damage interacts with 
HBV-mediated p53 suppression, providing crucial insights into 
hepatocarcinogenesis. The knowledge synthesized here underscores the importance 
of mitigating aflatoxin exposure alongside HBV control for effective HCC 
prevention and treatment strategies.
