Pericardial effusion is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is 
essentially a sign of pericardial involvement of the rheumatoid disease, but 
viral, bacterial and especially tuberculous pericarditis must not be excluded. 
Pericardial amyloidosis of the AA type is much less common and difficult to 
diagnose before cardiac biopsy even in cases of myocardial amyloidosis, as in 
the reported case, in which the classical association of microvoltage on the ECG 
and myocardial hypertrophy on echocardiography was absent. The absence of 
myocardial uptake of technetium-labelled pyrophosphates at myocardial 
scintigraphy and the absence of a restrictive profile on cardiac 
gamma-angiography were not suggestive of the diagnosis of amyloidosis. 
Pericardial and endomyocardial biopsy, justified by the negativity of the 
preceding investigations, provided an accurate histological diagnosis, a 
prognostic evaluation and was also useful for guiding management.
