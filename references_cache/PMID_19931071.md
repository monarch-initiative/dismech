Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is the result of aggressive enteral or parenteral 
feeding in a malnourished patient, with hypophosphatemia being the hallmark of 
this phenomenon. Other metabolic abnormalities, such as hypokalemia and 
hypomagnesemia, may also occur, along with sodium and fluid retention. The 
metabolic changes that occur in RFS can be severe enough to cause 
cardiorespiratory failure and death. This article reviews the pathophysiology, 
the clinical manifestations, and the management of RFS. The key to prevention is 
identifying patients at risk and being aware of the potential complications 
involved in rapidly reintroducing feeds to a malnourished patient.
