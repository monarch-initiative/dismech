Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis I) is an autosomal recessive 
lysosomal-storage disorder confined to the central nervous system, resulting 
from deficiency of hexosaminidase A. The case presented is of a twelve-month-old 
girl brought to the hospital because of mental-motor deterioration and 
convulsions. She was the child of first cousins and had a history of the deaths 
of two siblings with the same manifestations. Generalized hypotonia, 
macrocephaly, hyperacusis and a retinal cherry red spot appearance were present. 
There was no organomegaly. The diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease was made by means 
of absence of serum hexosaminidase A activity.
