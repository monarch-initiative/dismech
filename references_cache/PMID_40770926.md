INTRODUCTION: Tetanus remains a significant public health concern in 
resource-limited settings, with high mortality rates despite advances in 
critical care. The symptoms associated with tetanus are all triggers for 
delirium, and delirium exacerbates morbidity and complicates management in 
tetanus patients. Current research on tetanus-associated delirium is limited to 
extremely scarce case reports, which fail to provide sufficient evidence-based 
guidance for the clinical management of patients with tetanus-related delirium. 
Our review briefly introduced tetanus-related delirium of symptoms and features, 
pathophysiology, risk factors, early recognition and treatment strategies.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in multiple databases such as PubMed, 
Embase, and Web of Science, for literature published within the past six 
decades. Search terms included 'Tetanus, Delirium, Symptoms and Features, Early 
Recognition, Treatment', etc. Inclusion criteria included original research 
articles, review papers and case reports that provided relevant information on 
the topic. Exclusion criteria were non-relevant studies, duplicates and articles 
with insufficient data.
RESULTS: Systematic analysis elucidated tetanus-related delirium in terms of 
symptoms and features, pathophysiology, risk factors, early recognition. 
Comprehensive management protocols should integrate strategies for neurotoxin 
clearance, autonomic modulation, and spasm control through pharmacological and 
rehabilitative interventions.
CONCLUSION: Current research on tetanus-related delirium, encompassing 
symptomatology, pathophysiology, risk stratification, early recognition, and 
therapeutic interventions, remains insufficient. Large-scale prospective studies 
are essential to validate proposed management algorithms and refine 
evidence-based treatment protocols. Advancing this understanding is crucial for 
enhancing clinical outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.
