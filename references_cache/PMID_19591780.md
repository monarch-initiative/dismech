Arthritis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the most common 
disease manifestations. Nearly all joints can be affected by SLE, but hand and 
knee involvement are the most typical. Periarticular structures can be inflamed 
leading to tendonitis, tenosynovitis and tendon rupture. Avascular necrosis 
(AVN) also occurs causing joint pain and disability, typically in larger joints 
such as the hip and knee. This article addresses the clinical features of 
arthritis in lupus and an approach to the differential diagnosis. Treatment 
strategies include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids, 
anti-malarials and a variety of immunosuppressive medications.
