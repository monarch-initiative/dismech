## Content

This comprehensive review investigates the specific impact of the foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) on gastrointestinal health, focusing on its connection to post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). This review examines the pathogen’s pathophysiology, clinical implications and epidemiological trends using recent research and data to highlight its prevalence and association with PI-IBS. A detailed literature analysis synthesizes current research to illuminate Campylobacter’s long-lasting effects on gut microbiota and intestinal function. It provides a detailed analysis of the literature to shed light on C. jejuni’s long-term impact on gut microbiota and intestinal function. The findings suggest the need for multifaceted prevention and treatment approaches considering individual, microbial and epidemiological factors, thus contributing to a more nuanced understanding of PI-IBS following C. jejuni infection.
