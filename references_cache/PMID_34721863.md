This point of detected mutation could be considered as a novel mutational 
hotspot point that carried in patient ancestors. Moreover, the obtained results 
and family history suggest a precise genetic consulting and molecular prenatal 
evaluation for suspect individuals with a family history of mental and physical 
abnormalities.
