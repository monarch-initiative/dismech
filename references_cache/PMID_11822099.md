Peripheral insulin-resistance and impairment of the hepatocellular function are 
two major possible causes of diabetes mellitus in liver cirrhosis. The 
pathogenesis of insulin-resistance (receptorial or post-receptorial) is unknown 
but it represents an important complication because it has a profound impact on 
the pathology and natural history of the liver disease. The beta-cell capacity, 
to compensate the insulin-resistant state to avoid the onset of frank diabetes 
mellitus plays a critical importance. Many factors may induce a reduction of the 
beta-cell function in patients with liver cirrhosis: some are due to a 
predisposition to the development of diabetes: genetic or environmental, 
unrelated to the hepatic disease; some others are hepatic disease-dependent 
(excess liver and islet of Langerhans iron deposition, HCV infection rather than 
other hepatic infections, the co-presence of HCC) and may be crucial because 
additive to the previous. It is likely that the high prevalence of diabetes in 
liver cirrhosis is due to the early onset of strong insulin-resistance coupled 
to a deficient beta-cell function aggravated by hepatic disease-related factors.
