INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartomas 
comprise a spectrum of disorders that involve multiple systems and originate 
from a group of allelic disorders from germ line mutations in the PTEN gene. 
PTEN hamartomas involve a spectrum of disorders with diversed clinical 
manifestations and diagnosis can be challenging, particularly when lesions mimic 
other conditions.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a PTEN hamartoma in an eighteen-year-old 
male, who presented with a history of swelling on the chin with episodic bleeds. 
Initial diagnosis of an arteriovenous malformation was made radiologically but 
was later confirmed by histopathological and immunohistochemistry to be a case 
of PTEN hamartoma.
DISCUSSION: PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, and patients with germline PTEN 
mutations are more likely to develop malignancies, particularly epithelial, 
mesenchymal, and hematopoietic cancers. PTEN hamartomas cause a variety of 
conditions, including Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, 
PTEN-related Proteus syndrome, and Proteus-like syndrome. As a result, cancer 
surveillance is critical in managing PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PTHS) 
patients. All PTEN mutation carriers should adhere to approved cancer 
surveillance measures.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the unusual presentation of PTHS. It can 
present as an isolated PTEN hamartoma of Soft Tissue (PHOST) lesion without 
systemic findings and establishing a genetic diagnosis is important to the 
patient's future health. A multidisciplinary approach with the clinical, 
radiologic and pathologic findings of PTHS and PHOST lesions will more rapidly 
lead to an accurate diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are 
important to prevent potentially severe outcomes.
