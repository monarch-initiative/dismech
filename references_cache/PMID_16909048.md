We report two 71-year-old female monozygotic twins presenting with advanced 
hyperostosis frontalis interna, obesity, shortness and cognitive impairment. 
They both have suffered from generalized seizures since their early adulthood. 
Moreover, the patients showed some additional conditions only occurring in one 
individual or the other such as migraine, marked recurrent depressive disorder 
or polyarthrosis. The symptoms common to both twins appear to correspond to the 
Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome and indicate a genetic basis of this disorder as 
these features occur in genetically identical patients.
