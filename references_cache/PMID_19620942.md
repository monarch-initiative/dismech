Microsatellite instability (MSI) is the hallmark of a molecular pathway to 
carcinogenesis due to sporadic or inherited abnormalities of DNA mismatch repair 
genes. Inherited mutations are seen in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer 
syndrome. Endometrial carcinoma shows as high an incidence of MSI as does 
colorectal carcinoma. This review provides a framework for the gynecologic 
pathologist to understand the complexities of MSI in endometrial carcinoma, by 
discussing the basic mechanisms of mismatch repair and carcinogenesis, testing, 
the morphologic features of MSI endometrial cancer and the contradictory data 
regarding prognosis.
