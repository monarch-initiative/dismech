Huntington's disease.

Paulson GW.

Huntington's disease (chorea) is characterized by abnormal movements and 
dementia. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. The age of onset is 
variable, but there is a tendency for the symptoms to begin at about the same 
age in affected members of a family. Haloperidol is commonly used to treat the 
chorea; there is no treatment for the dementia. Recent research has suggested 
abnormalities in tissue levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Treatment is 
supportive and should be provided by the family physician.
