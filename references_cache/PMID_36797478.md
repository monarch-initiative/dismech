The most common form of genetic heart disease is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM), which is caused by variants in cardiac sarcomeric genes and leads to 
abnormal heart muscle thickening. Complications of HCM include heart failure, 
arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. The dominant-negative c.1208G>A (p.R403Q) 
pathogenic variant (PV) in β-myosin (MYH7) is a common and well-studied PV that 
leads to increased cardiac contractility and HCM onset. In this study we 
identify an adenine base editor and single-guide RNA system that can efficiently 
correct this human PV with minimal bystander editing and off-target editing at 
selected sites. We show that delivery of base editing components rescues 
pathological manifestations of HCM in induced pluripotent stem cell 
cardiomyocytes derived from patients with HCM and in a humanized mouse model of 
HCM. Our findings demonstrate the potential of base editing to treat inherited 
cardiac diseases and prompt the further development of adenine base editor-based 
therapies to correct monogenic variants causing cardiac disease.
