Lyme Disease has been called "The New Great Imitator," a replacement for that 
old "great imitator" neurosyphilis. This article reviews the numerous 
psychiatric and neurologic presentations found in adults and children. It then 
reviews the features of Lyme Disease, which makes it almost uniquely hard to 
diagnose, including the complexity and unreliability of serologic tests. 
Clinical examples follow that illustrate those presentations of this disease 
that mimic attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and 
multiple sclerosis.
