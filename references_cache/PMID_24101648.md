BACKGROUND: Cholera remains endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. We characterized the 
2009 cholera outbreaks in Kenya and evaluated the response.
METHODS: We analyzed surveillance data and estimated case fatality rates (CFRs). 
Households in 2 districts, East Pokot (224 cases; CFR = 11.7%) and Turkana South 
(1493 cases; CFR = 1.0%), were surveyed. We randomly selected 15 villages and 8 
households per village in each district. Healthcare workers at 27 health 
facilities (HFs) were surveyed in both districts.
RESULTS: In 2009, cholera outbreaks caused a reported 11 425 cases and 264 
deaths in Kenya. Data were available from 44 districts for 6893 (60%) cases. 
District CFRs ranged from 0% to 14.3%. Surveyed household respondents (n = 240) 
were aware of cholera (97.5%) and oral rehydration solution (ORS) (87.9%). 
Cholera deaths were reported more frequently from East Pokot (n = 120) than 
Turkana South (n = 120) households (20.7% vs. 12.3%). The average travel time to 
a HF was 31 hours in East Pokot compared with 2 hours in Turkana South. Fewer 
respondents in East Pokot (9.8%) than in Turkana South (33.9%) stated that ORS 
was available in their village. ORS or intravenous fluid shortages occurred in 
20 (76.9%) surveyed HFs.
CONCLUSIONS: High CFRs in Kenya are related to healthcare access disparities, 
including availability of rehydration supplies.
