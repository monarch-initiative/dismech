Asthma has a tendency, to destabilize and get worse at night, probably due to a 
nocturnal increase in airiway inflammation and bronchial responsiveness. 
Nocturnal airway narrowing in asthma is often associated with sleep disorders, 
such as episodes of nocturnal and early morning awakening, difficulty in 
maintaining sleep, and day time sleepiness. On the other hand, an association 
has been documented between nocturnal sleep-disordered breathing and asthma. 
This review highlights the causes of nocturnal worsening of asthma and examines 
the evidence pointing toward a causal relationship between nocturnal asthma and 
sleep-disordered breathing.
