Experimental evidence supports an intricate association between inflammation and 
mitochondrial dysfunction as main contributors of neurological diseases. 
Inflammatory mediators produced by activated microglia and infiltrated immune 
cells trigger intracellular signalling cascades that can alter cellular 
mitochondrial metabolism. Cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha, 
impede mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and associated ATP production and 
instigate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. This culminates in 
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, altered mitochondrial dynamics and 
might ultimately result in cell death. When severely injured mitochondria are 
not appropriately removed by mitophagy they can release their contents into the 
cytosol and extracellular environment and thereby amplify the inflammatory 
process. Here we provide a comprehensive overview on how inflammatory mediators 
impair mitochondrial metabolism and discuss how defective mitochondria can 
elicit and potentiate an inflammatory response.
