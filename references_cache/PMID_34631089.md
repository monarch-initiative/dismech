A 59-year-old man was diagnosed with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera. 
Subsequently, further laboratory testing revealed elevated ferritin and iron 
saturation. Genetic testing for HFE gene mutation screen revealed that the 
patient was positive for heterozygous C282Y mutation. The patient was ultimately 
diagnosed with both polycythemia vera and hereditary hemochromatosis.
