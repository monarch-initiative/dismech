Valproic acid therapy in childhood epilepsy.

Coulter DL, Wu H, Allen RJ.

Valproic acid, used alone or in combination with other anticonvulsants in 100 
children with epilepsy, improved seizure control in all age groups. Mean 
improvement in seizure control was 82%. Petit mal seizures responded best, but 
other types of seizures, even with associated mental and physical handicaps, 
also responded well. A substantial improvement in alertness and behavior often 
occurred. Leukopenia (27%) and an elevated SGOT value (44%) were frequent but 
transient. Other side effects included alopecia (1), gastrointestinal distress 
with vomiting (7), pancreatitis (1), thrombocytopenia (1), edema (2), and coma 
(2). Three severely retarded children with frequent seizures died while 
receiving valproic acid, but it is not clear that death was caused by valproic 
acid. Children must be monitored carefully for potential toxic effects, and drug 
interactions with other anticonvulsants may cause problems in treatment.
