Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare multisystem genetic disease, with high 
phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Rod-cone dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, 
hypogonadism, cognitive impairment and renal abnormalities have been established 
as primary features. There are 17 BBS genes (BBS1-BBS17) described to date, 
which explain 70-80% of the patients clinically diagnosed, therefore more BBS 
genes remain to be identified. BBS belongs to a group of diseases known as 
ciliopathies. In general, ciliopathies and BBS in particular share a partial 
overlapping phenotype that makes them complicated to diagnose. We present an 
up-to-date review including clinical, epidemiologic and genetic aspects of the 
syndrome.
