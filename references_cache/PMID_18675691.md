Meniere's disease is a chronic illness that affects a substantial number of 
patients every year worldwide. The disease is characterised by intermittent 
episodes of vertigo lasting from minutes to hours, with fluctuating 
sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural pressure. Although there is 
currently no cure, more than 85% of patients with Meniere's disease are helped 
by either changes in lifestyle and medical treatment, or minimally invasive 
surgical procedures such as intratympanic steroid therapy, intratympanic 
gentamicin therapy, and endolymphatic sac surgery. Vestibular neurectomy has a 
very high rate of vertigo control and is available for patients with good 
hearing who have failed all other treatments. Labyrinthectomy is undertaken as a 
last resort and is best reserved for patients with unilateral disease and 
deafness.
