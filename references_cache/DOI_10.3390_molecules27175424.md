## Content

Poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) is a biodegradable, biosafe, and biocompatible copolymer. The Aspergillus section Nigri causes otomycosis localized in the external auditory canal. In this research, Aspergillus brasiliensis, a species belonging to the Nigri section, was tested. Coumarin 6 and pterostilbene loaded in poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles (PLGA-coumarin6-NPs and PLGA-PTB-NPs) were tested for fungal cell uptake and antifungal ability against A. brasiliensis biofilm, respectively. Moreover, the activity of PLGA-PTB-NPs in inhibiting the A. brasiliensis infection was tested using Galleria mellonella larvae. The results showed a fluorescence signal, after 50 nm PLGA-coumarin6-NPs treatment, inside A. brasiliensis hyphae and along the entire thickness of the biofilm matrix, which was indicative of an efficient NP uptake. Regarding antifungal activity, a reduction in A. brasiliensis biofilm formation and mature biofilm with PLGA-PTB-NPs has been demonstrated. Moreover, in vivo experiments showed a significant reduction in mortality of infected larvae after injection of PLGA-PTB-NPs compared to free PTB at the same concentration. In conclusion, the PLGA-NPs system can increase the bioavailability of PTB in Aspergillus section Nigri biofilm by overcoming the biofilm matrix barrier and delivering PTB to fungal cells.
