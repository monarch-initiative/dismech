Ainhum is the spontaneous autoamputation of toes as a result of the formation of 
a constricting band. It usually affects the fifth toe bilaterally and 
predominantly affects blacks in tropical regions, but has been uncommonly 
reported in temperate regions as well, including the United States. Of the 29 
cases identified in the American literature since 1960, only 6 were published in 
the internal medicine literature. Because of the rarity of ainhum and consequent 
lack of attention in the clinical literature, this condition may be relatively 
unknown and therefore unrecognized by practicing internists. A patient with 
ainhum is described and the clinical features of this rare disease are 
emphasized to facilitate recognition and appropriate management.
