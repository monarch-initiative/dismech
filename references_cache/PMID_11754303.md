Paraneoplastic disorders may affect any part of the central or peripheral 
nervous systems. Although relatively uncommon, these disorders are a significant 
cause of neurologic morbidity for cancer patients. At least some paraneoplastic 
syndromes are believed to be caused by an autoimmune reaction against shared 
tumor-neural antigens. This article summarizes the clinical features of 
paraneoplastic disorders, the current evidence for autoimmunity, and guidelines 
for diagnosis and treatment.
