Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents an important and 
increasing burden throughout the world. Classically, COPD has been considered a 
respiratory condition only, mainly caused by tobacco smoking. However, COPD has 
important manifestations beyond the lungs, the so-called systemic effects. These 
include unintentional weight loss, skeletal muscle dysfunction, an increased 
risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and depression, among others. 
Low-grade, chronic systemic inflammation is one of the key mechanisms underlying 
these systemic effects. Because these extra-pulmonary manifestations of COPD are 
common and/or may have significant implications for the patient wellbeing and 
prognosis, they warrant systematic screening and appropriate management in order 
to provide optimal medical care.
