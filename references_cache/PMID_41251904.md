Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) is 
characterized by the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene resulting from the translocation 
t(9;22). This type of leukemia represents a biologically and clinically distinct 
subset of ALL, known for its aggressive nature and comparatively poor prognosis 
among hematologic malignancies. Although the advent of tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) has converted the therapeutic view and fulfilled short-term 
outcomes, resistant responses remain limited, and disease relapse, often due to 
BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutations or activation of alternative signaling 
pathways, continues to impede long-term success. Recent findings emphasizes the 
essential involvement of microRNAs in leukemogenesis, TKI resistance, and the 
advancement of Ph+ ALL. Importantly, miR-17∼92 cluster members (such as miR-17, 
miR-18a, miR-20a) can prompt apoptosis by direct suppression of BCL2 in 
BCR::ABL1 positive cells. Moreover, epigenetic silencing of miR-203 enhances 
BCR::ABL1 expression, further contributing to TKI resistance. These small 
regulatory RNAs consequently act for promising candidates both as therapeutic 
targets and as prognostic biomarkers, with the potential to fill treatment gaps 
that persist even in the TKI era.
