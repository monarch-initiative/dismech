Approximately 15% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) will have 
the onset of their disease in childhood or adolescence. Due to the broad range 
of possible clinical features of SLE, the diagnosis may be difficult to make in 
a general pediatric or community setting. The common symptoms of SLE in children 
and adolescents include fever, fatigue, weight loss, arthritis, rash and renal 
disease. SLE is more common in non-Caucasian ethnic groups and should be 
considered in the differential diagnosis of a multisystem disease in these 
patients. In this article, the classification criteria for SLE are discussed, 
and an approach to making an accurate and timely diagnosis of this disease is 
considered.
