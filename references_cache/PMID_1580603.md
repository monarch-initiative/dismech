Modern techniques of molecular biology have made it possible to identify 
mutations in a number of different hereditary red cell enzyme defects. Most of 
the studies have been performed in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, 
where a large number of point mutations have been identified. The same mutations 
are encountered repeatedly, even in patients with defects that were thought, on 
the basis of biochemical properties of the residual enzyme, to be distinct. A 
beginning has been made in identifying mutations in a few other red cell enzyme 
defects.
