Central core disease (CCD) of muscle is an inherited myopathy which is closely 
associated with malignant hyperthermia (MH) in humans. CCD has recently been 
shown to be tightly linked to the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and mutations 
in this gene are known to be present in MH. Mutation screening of RYR1 has led 
to the identification of two previously undescribed mutations in different CCD 
pedigrees. One of these mutations was also detected in an unrelated MH pedigree 
whose members are asymptomatic of CCD. The data suggest a model to explain how a 
single mutation may result in two apparently distinct clinical phenotypes.
