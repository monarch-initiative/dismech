BACKGROUND Netherton syndrome is an autosomal recessive skin disorder usually 
diagnosed in infancy and is characterized by ichthyosis, erythroderma, atopy, 
and characteristic beading of the hair shaft (trichorrhexis invaginata). 
Secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-17, has recently 
been reported to be effective in patients with refractory Netherton syndrome. 
The present report describes a 20-year-old man with a chronic history of 
refractory Netherton syndrome who responded to treatment with secukinumab. CASE 
REPORT A 20-year-old male patient presented with generalized pruritus, erythema, 
and scaling. The patient was previously diagnosed with atopic dermatitis and had 
been treated with systemic corticosteroids and omalizumab, without improvement. 
Later, the patient was referred to us. Physical examination showed generalized 
erythroderma and polycyclic and serpiginous erythematous plaques with 
double-edged scales at the margins. Trichoscopy of the scalp revealed a hair 
shaft abnormality, specifically trichorrhexis invaginata. The blood tests 
demonstrated elevated IgE levels. Initially, the patient was started on topical 
corticosteroids, which caused the condition to deteriorate. As the patient did 
not respond to the treatment, a decision was made to start secukinumab 
monotherapy. After 2 injections, the patient's condition markedly improved and 
the effect after the last injection was maintained for 4-5 months. CONCLUSIONS 
Netherton syndrome is a rare and often misdiagnosed hereditary diseases in 
dermatology. For this reason, the management strategies of the disease are 
variable and without consensus. In our case, considering the pathogenesis of the 
disease, we used secukinumab, which has shown promising results and good 
tolerability. Further studies are required to establish the efficacy of the 
drug.
