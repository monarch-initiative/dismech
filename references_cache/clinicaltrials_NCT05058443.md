# Denosumab Protects Bone Loss and Function in Patients With Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fracture After Percutaneous Vertebroplasty: a Randomized Placebo-controlled Clinical Trial

## Content

This study aimed to investigate the effect of denosumab on bone mineral density(BMD), bone turnover markers(BTMs), functional status, secondary fracture rate, and adverse effects in osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) patients after vertebroplasty during a 12-month follow-up period.
