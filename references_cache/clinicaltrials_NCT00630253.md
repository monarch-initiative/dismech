# A Study of Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine, and Antithymocyte Globulin Followed by Matched Sibling Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Patients With Fanconi Anemia

## Content

RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, before a donor stem cell transplant helps to remove the patient's cells to allow for the transplant cells to take and grow. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving antithymocyte globulin and removing the T cells from the donor cells before transplant and giving cyclosporine before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin followed by donor stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with Fanconi anemia.
