We studied 573 patients with the Marfan syndrome for the presence of ocular 
misalignment, refractive errors, and amblyopia. A total of 110 patients (19.2%) 
had strabismus. Of 573 patients, exotropia occurred in 67 (11.7%), esotropia in 
12 (2.1%), vertical deviations in eight (1.4%), and primary inferior oblique 
muscle overaction in three (0.5%). Of 67 patients with exotropia, 18 had 
anisometropia and 39 had amblyopia. Of the 12 patients with esotropia, four had 
amblyopia and none had anisometropia. Exotropia and esotropia are more common in 
patients with the Marfan syndrome than in the general population of the United 
States (P < .001 for exotropia and .05 < P < .10 for esotropia). Abnormal 
afferent visual inputs to cortical centers caused by ectopia lentis, 
craniofacial abnormalities, and mechanical and genetic factors may all 
contribute to the higher prevalence of strabismus in this disease.
