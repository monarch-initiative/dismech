Lynch syndrome is the hereditary disorder that most frequently predisposes to 
colorectal cancer as well as predisposing to a number of extracolonic cancers, 
most prominently endometrial cancer. It is caused by germline mutations in the 
mismatch repair genes. Both its phenotype and genotype show marked 
heterogeneity. This review gives a historical overview of the syndrome, its 
heterogeneity, its genomic landscape, and its implications for complex 
diagnosis, genetic counseling and putative implications for immunotherapy.
