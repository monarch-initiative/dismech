We analysed the AIDS-defining diseases in all 618 notified AIDS patients in 
Denmark by June 30, 1990, and looked for trends and associations over time. 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was the most commonly reported disease 
(47%), and showed some but insignificant changes over time. The number of 
patients reported with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) declined significantly from 33% in 
1980-84 to 12% in 1990. KS was reported 5 times as often in homosexual men as in 
all other AIDS patients while esophageal candidiasis was reported in one fifth 
of the patients and were reported twice as often in women as in homosexual men. 
Wasting and HIV encephalopathy were 2.5 times more often reported in women than 
in homosexual men. The overall survival rate was 56% (95% confidence interval: 
51-61%) at 1 year and 21% (95% confidence interval: 15-28%) at 3 years. 
Significantly improved survival over time was observed in patients diagnosed 
with PCP. Patients reported with KS had a significantly better prognosis than 
those with PCP. Women in general had a bad prognosis.
