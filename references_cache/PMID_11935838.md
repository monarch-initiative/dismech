COPD, a common disease with potentially devastating consequences, is both 
preventable and treatable. The key to successful disease management is 
differential diagnosis, and the most important intervention is smoking 
cessation. Medications can be used to reduce symptoms, vaccines to prevent 
life-threatening exacerbations, and oxygen to treat hypoxemia. Diet and exercise 
also may help improve outcomes.
