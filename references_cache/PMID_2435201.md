Developmental therapeutics and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

DeVita VT Jr, Broder S, Fauci AS, Kovacs JA, Chabner BA.

Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) die of overwhelming 
infections as a consequence of the destruction of the T4 subset of lymphocytes. 
Approaches to the treatment of AIDS have involved attempts to reestablish immune 
competence as well as treat opportunistic infections. The discovery of the human 
T-lymphotropic virus type III, which causes AIDS, has provided a specific target 
for screening antiviral drugs. There are many potential screening targets, from 
surface-binding proteins to viral integration and assembly, but most of the 
recent efforts have been aimed at developing drugs to inhibit the unique viral 
DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). The early studies with 
3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) have provided encouraging results.
