IMPORTANCE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, affecting an 
estimated more than 240 million people worldwide, including an estimated more 
than 32 million in the US. Osteoarthritis is the most frequent reason for 
activity limitation in adults. This Review focuses on hip and knee OA.
OBSERVATIONS: Osteoarthritis can involve almost any joint but typically affects 
the hands, knees, hips, and feet. It is characterized by pathologic changes in 
cartilage, bone, synovium, ligament, muscle, and periarticular fat, leading to 
joint dysfunction, pain, stiffness, functional limitation, and loss of valued 
activities, such as walking for exercise and dancing. Risk factors include age 
(33% of individuals older than 75 years have symptomatic and radiographic knee 
OA), female sex, obesity, genetics, and major joint injury. Persons with OA have 
more comorbidities and are more sedentary than those without OA. The reduced 
physical activity leads to a 20% higher age-adjusted mortality. Several physical 
examination findings are useful diagnostically, including bony enlargement in 
knee OA and pain elicited with internal hip rotation in hip OA. Radiographic 
indicators include marginal osteophytes and joint space narrowing. The 
cornerstones of OA management include exercises, weight loss if appropriate, and 
education-complemented by topical or oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) in those without contraindications. Intra-articular steroid injections 
provide short-term pain relief and duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy. Opiates 
should be avoided. Clinical trials have shown promising results for compounds 
that arrest structural progression (eg, cathepsin K inhibitors, Wnt inhibitors, 
anabolic growth factors) or reduce OA pain (eg, nerve growth factor inhibitors). 
Persons with advanced symptoms and structural damage are candidates for total 
joint replacement. Racial and ethnic disparities persist in the use and outcomes 
of joint replacement.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hip and knee OA are highly prevalent and disabling. 
Education, exercise and weight loss are cornerstones of management, complemented 
by NSAIDs (for patients who are candidates), corticosteroid injections, and 
several adjunctive medications. For persons with advanced symptoms and 
structural damage, total joint replacement effectively relieves pain.
