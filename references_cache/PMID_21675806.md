An S-Ic-I-R epidemic model is investigated for infectious diseases that can be 
transmitted through carriers, infected individuals who are contagious but do not 
show any disease symptoms. Mathematical analysis is carried out that completely 
determines the global dynamics of the model. The impacts of disease carriers on 
the transmission dynamics are discussed through the basic reproduction number 
and through numerical simulations.
