## Content

AbstractFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic germline adenomatous polyposis coli mutation, and characterized with multiple adenomas in the colon and the rectum. Various genetic variants have been confirmed to be associated with corresponding FAP phenotypes, which play important roles in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of FAP. Generally, proctocolectomy is recommended for FAP patients at the age of 20s. Exceptionally, for patients with attenuated FAP, high-risk of desmoid, chemoprevention therapy, or other circumstances, surgery can be postponed. With the wide application of minimal invasive surgery in colorectal cancer, laparoscopic, robotic surgery, and natural orifice specimen extraction are proved to be feasible for FAP patients, but high-level evidences are needed to confirm their safety and advantages. In the times of precise medicine, the surgical management of FAP should vary with individuals based on genotype, phenotype, and clinical practice. Therefore, in addition to innovation in surgical procedures, investigation in links between genetic features and phenotypes will be helpful to optimize the surgical management of FAP in the future.
