# Gene expression analysis of rectal mucosa in chronic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared to healthy volunteers (HV)

## Content

An investigation of gene expression changes in rectal biopsies from donors with IBS compared to controls to begin to understand this complex syndrome. To further investigate differences between IBS groups (constipation and diarrhoea predominant) (part1) and how IBS relates to bacterial infection (part2) with biopsies taken 6 months after Campylobacter jejuni infection.
