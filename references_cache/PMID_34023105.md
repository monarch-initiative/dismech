Sebaceous neoplasia primarily includes sebaceous adenoma, sebaceoma, and 
sebaceous carcinoma (SC). Sebaceous adenoma, sebaceoma, and a subset of 
cutaneous SC are frequently associated with defective DNA mismatch repair 
resulting from mutations in MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6. These tumors can be sporadic or 
associated with Muir-Torre syndrome. SCs without defective DNA mismatch repair 
have ultraviolet signature mutation or paucimutational patterns. Ocular SCs have 
low mutation burdens and frequent mutations in ZNF750. Some ocular sebaceous 
carcinomas have TP53 and RB1 mutations similar to cutaneous SC, whereas others 
lack such mutations and are associated with human papilloma virus infection.
