Satoyoshi syndrome was first reported in Japan in 1967. It is a rare multisystem 
disorder of presumed autoimmune etiology that is characterized by alopecia, 
intermittent painful muscle spasms, diarrhea, and antinuclear antibody 
positivity. We report an 11-year-old girl with Satoyoshi syndrome who presented 
to the dermatology department for treatment of alopecia universalis. We present 
this case to emphasize the importance of recognizing Satoyoshi syndrome, which 
could go unnoticed if not suspected.
