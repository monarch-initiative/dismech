Belonging to the family Taeniidae, the tapeworm Echinococcus is responsible for 
causing echinococcosis in humans. There are four species of Echinococcus known 
to produce infections in humans. Among these, E. granulosus and E. 
multilocularis are the most common ones responsible for causing cystic 
echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), respectively. On the other 
hand, E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus cause polycystic echinococcosis, but the 
incidence in humans is quite rare.
