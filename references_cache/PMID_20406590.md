A complex interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental influences 
results in the clinical picture of allergic asthma. This article addresses 
recently identified genetic markers and environmental factors that contribute to 
disease development in asthma. Focus is placed on aspects of the innate immune 
system, including inherent properties of allergens, the active role of airway 
epithelium, and the central importance of dendritic cells together with the 
pathophysiological processes in which these factors interact. Implications of 
these processes for asthma therapy, with a focus on anti-IgE treatment are also 
discussed.
