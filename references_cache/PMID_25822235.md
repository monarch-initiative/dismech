OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the causative agents of serious bacterial infection 
(SBI) in young infants and the optimal approach to empiric antibiotic therapy 
for infants with SBI.
METHODS: From May 1, 2011, to December 1, 2013, pertinent clinical data were 
collected on previously well infants 60 days or younger with SBI as defined by a 
positive bacterial culture from a sterile site. Infants were identified by 
prospective surveillance of admissions and daily review of microbiology records.
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five infants with SBI were identified. Mean age was 
32 days (SD ±16.6 days). Twenty-nine infants had meningitis, 66 had bacteremia 
(37 with concomitant urinary tract infection), and 170 had urinary tract 
infection alone. No methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., or penicillin-resistant Streptococcus 
pneumoniae were identified. Four extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing 
gram-negative bacilli were seen. Empiric therapy was ampicillin and gentamicin 
(n = 116, 44%) or third-generation cephalosporin based (n = 149, 56%). 
Ampicillin and gentamicin, with third-generation cephalosporins reserved for 
cases where meningitis is suspected, would have provided effective coverage for 
98.5% of infants and unnecessarily broad therapy for 4.3%. Third-generation 
cephalosporins with ampicillin would have been effective for 98.5% of infants 
and unnecessarily broad for 83.8%. Third-generation cephalosporin monotherapy 
was less effective than either combination (P < 0.001). Fifty-seven percent of 
broad spectrum empiric therapy was continued despite culture results allowing 
de-escalation.
CONCLUSIONS: Ampicillin/gentamicin remains an effective empiric regimen for 
infants 60 days or younger with suspected SBI. Use of a third-generation 
cephalosporin for suspected meningitis is appropriate, but cerebrospinal fluid 
must be obtained promptly to guide appropriate therapy.
