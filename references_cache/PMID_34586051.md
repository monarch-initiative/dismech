Vibrio cholerae O1 is the aetiological agent of the severe diarrhoeal disease 
cholera. Annually, there are an estimated 1-4 million cholera cases worldwide 
and over 140 000 deaths. The primary mode of disease transmission is through the 
consumption of water or food contaminated with the bacterium. Although cholera 
patients can be treated effectively using rehydration therapy, the disease 
remains a major scourge in areas with limited access to clean water and proper 
sanitation. Its continued prevalence highlights the failure of socioeconomic 
policies leading to wealth disparities, fragile and dated public infrastructure, 
and lack of appropriate health surveillance.
