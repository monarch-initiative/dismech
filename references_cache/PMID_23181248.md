Mucociliary clearance is a primary defence mechanism of the airway that can be 
altered in congenital diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic 
fibrosis, as well as acquired conditions. This article focuses on primary 
ciliary dyskinesia and the diagnostic approach to it, which is still evolving.
