Collagenous gastritis (CG) is a rare gastrointestinal disorder characterized by 
subepithelial collagen deposition and lamina propria inflammation. Despite its 
first description over four decades ago, the pathogenesis remains unclear, with 
no standardized pathologic criteria/classification, treatment or established 
prognosis. A systematic PubMed search identified all English-language case 
reports, series and observational studies describing CG. Data on demographics, 
clinical presentation, endoscopic appearance and histologic features were 
extracted. Of the 133 patients with available demographic data, 101 patients had 
corresponding histologic information, reflecting the overall rarity and limited 
characterization of collagenous gastritis in the literature. The most common 
presenting symptoms were abdominal pain and chronic anaemia. A subset of 
patients had concurrent collagenous colitis, collagenous sprue, Helicobacter 
pylori gastritis or celiac disease. The predominant endoscopic finding was 
gastric mucosal nodularity, typically diffuse or corpus-predominant. Collagen 
band thickness ranged widely, with a median of 50.5 μm and a maximum of 225 μm. 
Band distribution was most commonly pan-gastric or corpus-predominant. Among the 
proposed histologic subtypes of CG, the atrophic pattern was most frequently 
observed and often correlated with isolated gastric involvement and lack of 
clinical or histologic remission. This review highlights that histologic 
classification may help guide differential diagnoses and prognosis. Accordingly, 
we advocate for explicit reporting of these features in pathology reports. Key 
gaps in pathogenesis, including the roles of environmental and genetic factors, 
are also reviewed. This review synthesizes current knowledge of CG and 
underscores the need for further studies to clarify disease mechanisms. Improved 
histologic classification and exploration of underlying aetiologies may enhance 
diagnosis, treatment and research in this underrecognized condition.
