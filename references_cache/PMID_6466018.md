Bacterial meningitis in the elderly.

Gorse GJ, Thrupp LD, Nudleman KL, Wyle FA, Hawkins B, Cesario TC.

To assess the implications of meningitis in a more mature population, we 
reviewed the records of patients with meningitis: 71 aged 50 years and older and 
138 patients aged 15 to 49 years. Among the older population, 54 (76%) had 
bacterial, nine (13%) had granulomatous, and eight (11%) had aseptic meningitis. 
Among the cases of bacterial meningitis in the older age group, Streptococcus 
pneumoniae accounted for 24% (13/54) and enteric bacilli accounted for 17% 
(9/54). Serious complications occurred in 38 elderly patients (70%) with 
bacterial meningitis, and mortality occurred in 24 (44%). In the younger age 
group with bacterial meningitis, the complication rate and mortality were 41% 
(13/32) and 13% (4/32), respectively. Meningitis in the elderly is likely to be 
bacterial and to cause greater morbidity and mortality.
