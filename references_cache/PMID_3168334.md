Vitiligo is a disease that affects from 1 to 3 per cent of the population. It is 
characterized by cutaneous white macules that often develop in cosmetically 
important areas such as the face, the dorsal hands, and the arms. It may be 
accompanied by ocular abnormalities and a number of associated disorders such as 
thyroid disease, diabetes, pernicious anemia, and alopecia areata. There is 
increasing evidence that vitiligo is an autoimmune disease. Although there is as 
yet no definitive cure, many patients have obtained respectable repigmentation 
by the use of topical or oral psoralen plus ultraviolet light. When large areas 
of skin are involved or when the patient is unresponsive to therapy, serious 
consideration should be given to depigmentation with monobenzone (Benoquin).
