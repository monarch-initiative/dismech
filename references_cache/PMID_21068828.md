Psychotic syndromes can be understood as disorders of adaptation to social 
context. Although heritability is often emphasized, onset is associated with 
environmental factors such as early life adversity, growing up in an urban 
environment, minority group position and cannabis use, suggesting that exposure 
may have an impact on the developing 'social' brain during sensitive periods. 
Therefore heritability, as an index of genetic influence, may be of limited 
explanatory power unless viewed in the context of interaction with social 
effects. Longitudinal research is needed to uncover gene-environment interplay 
that determines how expression of vulnerability in the general population may 
give rise to more severe psychopathology.
