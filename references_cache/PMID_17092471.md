The neurologic manifestations of patients with phenylketonuria treated at 
different ages are illustrated in this series of 146 cases, including 9 sib 
pairs. In addition to well-known findings such as mental retardation, autistic 
features, microcephaly, and tremor, motor retardation was common and responded 
promptly to dietary treatment. Hypotonia and diminished reflexes were more 
frequent findings than hypertonia. Four sib pairs showed divergent features, 
such as the later-treated sibling having higher function than the early-treated 
one. Because siblings have a similar genotype and similar environmental and 
dietary conditions, this observation can be explained by differences in 
phenylalanine transport to the brain or additional metabolic or perinatal 
factors influencing the neurologic outcome.
