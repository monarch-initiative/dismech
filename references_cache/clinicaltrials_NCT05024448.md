# Glucocorticosteroid Treatment in Acute Unilateral Vestibulopathy, a Multicentric, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study

## Content

The vestibular system is a part of the inner ear and functions as a motion sensor. It provides the central nervous system with information about changes of the head position. This information is essential for the proper functioning of the balance system. In particular, it ensures effective postural control and gaze stabilization. Abrupt vestibular deficit is defined as a sudden loss of the vestibular function. In the acute phase the patient presents mainly with intense rotatory vertigo and instability, most often accompanied by nausea. The symptoms are exacerbated by head movements. The diagnosis is made by observation of a spontaneous nystagmus, measurement of a pathological head impulse test and an asymmetric response to caloric tests, in the absence of other neurological symptoms. Although the etiology is unknown, it could be of viral or vascular origin. Symptoms usually regress within a few days or weeks. Vestibular function recovers in about half of the cases, in the other half a central compensation process is set up. The benefit of a 3-week course of corticosteroids has been demonstrated in one study. The dosage has been debated. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the benefit of a 10-day course of oral corticosteroids. The primary objective is to demonstrate a significant reduction in the rate of asymmetry of caloric response and the secondary objective is to demonstrate a significant reduction in the impact of symptoms assessed with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) score at 1 year.
