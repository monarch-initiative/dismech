Bardet- biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare heterogenous autosomal recessive disease 
due to defects in primary cilia which until now, up to 21 types have been 
detected. A few reports of BBS in Iran have been published but this is the first 
type 9 genotyped and clinically discussed case. This type can cause severe and 
delayed onset renal failure.
