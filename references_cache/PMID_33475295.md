Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is involved in single-strand DNA break base 
excision repair. PARP inhibition causes synthetic lethality in breast cancers 
associated with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and is routinely used in 
clinical practice for metastatic breast cancer. Breast cancers with homologous 
recombination deficiency or BRCAness, most commonly triple-negative breast 
cancers, may also benefit. Currently, PARP inhibitor use for triple-negative 
breast cancer with wild-type BRCA does not have definitive efficacy; however, 
this is an area of active research. Further clinical and translational data may 
identify additional patient populations that will benefit from PARP inhibitor 
therapy.
