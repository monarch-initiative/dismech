Dengue fever is a common tropical infection. This acute febrile illness can be a 
deadly infection in cases of severe manifestation, causing dengue hemorrhagic 
shock. In this brief article, I will summarize and discuss the diagnosis and 
treatment of this disease. For diagnosis of dengue, most tropical doctors make 
use of presumptive diagnosis; however, the definite diagnosis should be based on 
immunodiagnosis or viral study. Focusing on treatment, symptomatic and 
supportive treatment is the main therapeutic approach. The role of antiviral 
drugs in the treatment of dengue fever has been limited, but is currently widely 
studied.
