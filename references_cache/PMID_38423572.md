Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a rare genetic disorder characterised by a 
non-functioning PTH. Usually, the diagnosis is made following (symptomatic) 
hypocalcaemia. We describe a case in which epileptic seizures and abnormalities 
in dental development were the main clinical manifestation of PHP type 1B. This 
case demonstrates the importance of screening for hypocalcaemia in patients with 
de novo epileptic seizures. In addition, antiepileptic medications themselves 
may interfere with calcium-phosphate metabolism, causing or aggravating a 
hypocalcaemia as well. By correcting the calcium level, a resolution of these 
symptoms could be obtained.
