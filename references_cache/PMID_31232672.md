Objective: Pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (PSLE) is a heterogeneous 
autoimmune disorder of unknown origin. PTPN22 gene polymorphisms have been 
associated with SLE in different populations. We investigated the associations 
of the rs2476601, rs1217414, rs33996649, rs1276457, and rs1310182 SNPs in the 
PTPN22 gene with PSLE. Materials and methods: 55 PSLE patients and 93 healthy 
controls were recruited. SNPs were genotyped by the real-time PCR allelic 
discrimination method. Results: We found that the PTPN22 polymorphisms rs1310182 
A allele (p = 0.01, OR = 1.92 95% CI = 1.16-3.18), and rs1310182 AA genotype 
with (p < 0.001) and rs12760457 TT (p = 0.046) were associated with PSLE. No 
significant associations were found between other SNPs and PSLE. Conclusions: 
The PTPN22 rs1310182 A allele and rs1310182 AA genotype were associated with 
PSLE and may be a possible genetic marker for susceptibility to PSLE. However, 
further investigation would be required to elucidate the mechanistic role of 
this association.
