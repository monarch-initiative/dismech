Meckel-Gruber syndrome is a rare and lethal autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by occipital encephalocele, postaxial polydactyly and bilateral 
dysplastic cystic kidneys. It can be associated with many other conditions. 
Antenatal ultrasound examination establishes the diagnosis by identifying at 
least two of the major features described. We describe a female baby who had the 
typical triad of Meckel-Gruber syndrome and died shortly after birth.
