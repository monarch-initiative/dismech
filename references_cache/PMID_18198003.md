Acute parvovirus B19 infection is a risk for pregnant women. After vertical 
transmission the infected fetus may develop hydrops fetalis. Since B19 infection 
occurs mainly during childhood, children represent a main source for virus 
transmission. In order to determine whether certain groups in the German 
population show increased risks for B19 infection we analysed the seroprevalence 
using 6583 sera collected from adults in former Eastern and Western Germany 
during the German National Health Survey and 649 sera from healthy Thuringian 
children and adolescents. In adults the overall seroprevalence was 72.1%, rising 
from 20.4% in children (1-3 years) and 66.9% in adolescents (18-19 years) to 
79.1% in the elderly (65-69 years). Significant differences were observed 
between females (73.3%) and males (70.9%) and between inhabitants of small 
(74.8%) and big cities (69.0%) but not between people of the former Eastern 
(72.8%) and Western states (72.0%) of Germany. For women during childbearing age 
(18-49 years) highest values were observed in those living together with two or 
more children (81.6%) and in women with occupational contact with children aged 
<6 years (88.9%). In contrast seroprevalence was significantly lower in 
age-matched female singles (64.8%) and in women with occupational contact with 
children aged >6 years and adolescents (63.8%).
