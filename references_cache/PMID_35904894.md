The current monkeypox epidemic is a major public health concern as the global 
outbreak continues to grow. We present a case report to highlight the salient 
points for dermatologists. Human monkeypox is a zoonosis caused by monkeypox 
virus, belonging to the Orthopoxvirus genus and is a close relative of the 
variola virus. Pleomorphic skin lesions appear ranging from macules, papules, 
vesicles, pustules, some of which may appear umbilicated before crusting over. 
Dermatologists play a key role in early recognition of new cases, aiding 
diagnoses leading to prevention of disease spread through identification and 
isolation, contact tracing and education.
