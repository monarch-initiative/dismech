The incidence and prevalence of Crohn's disease are increasing, particularly in 
the Western world and Asia. Corticosteroids have been used for decades to treat 
active Crohn's disease and remain the mainstay in the management of 
moderate-to-severe relapses in Crohn's disease. The use of corticosteroids, 
despite their efficacy, may be associated with several drawbacks. This review 
article provides a comprehensive account of the role of corticosteroids in 
inducing remission in adult patients with Crohn's disease, including aspects 
such as approaches to corticosteroid sparing and to minimize the risk of 
corticosteroid dependency, as well as the role of newer corticosteroids such as 
budesonide in reducing systemic adverse effects.
