Olmsted syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by symmetrical sharply 
marginated mutilating keratoderma of palms & soles & hyperkeratotic plaques 
around the body orifices, onychodystrophy, ainhum & amputation of digital 
phalanges, flextion deformities of the fingers, localized alopecia, 
leukokeratosis of the tongue, shortness of stature & laxity of large joints. 
Inheritance is autosomal dominant, although sporadic cases have been reported. 
Here we describe two cases of this rare disorder with thickened hyperkeratotic 
lesion over palm & soles & along with amputation of 3rd , 4th & 5th toes in one 
case. In one of our case (case no. 2) the immediate younger brother has got the 
same disease. Both of them were treated with tab. Neotegason 25 mg orally daily 
for 3 months & there was significant improvement after treatment.
