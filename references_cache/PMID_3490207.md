Klinefelter's syndrome, mosaic 46,XX/46,XY/47,XXY/48,XXXY/48,XXYY: a case 
report.

A 35-year-old male was investigated for primary infertility. Clinical 
examination showed an intelligent man with normal facial appearance and 
moustache and small firm testes. Testicular histopathology revealed marked 
atrophy of the testes with no spermatogenesis and absence of germ cells. 
Hormonal profile showed elevated levels of FSH,LH and low levels of 
testosterone. Chromosome analysis from whole blood culture showed cells with 
46,XX/46,XY/47,XXY/48,XXXY/48,XXYY mosaicism. The predominant cell line was 
47,XXY (87.86%). 46,XY/47,XXY mosaicism is not uncommon. However, mosaicism of 
multiple sex chromosome aneuploidy is rarely observed. This is the first report 
of mosaicism in Klinefelter's syndrome variant with five cell lines.
