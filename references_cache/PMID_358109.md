Heritable disorders of connective tissue: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Hollister DW.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a relatively common heritable disorder of 
connective tissue. The cardinal features are cutaneous hyperextensibility, joint 
hypermobility, bleeding diathesis, and tissue fragility, and these features lead 
to a large variety of additional manifestations. Of the eight presently 
described types, four varieties have been found to be caused by defects in the 
biogenesis of collagen, the major structural protein of the body. Consideration 
of the clinical features and probable mode of inheritance will permit 
subclassification of many patients into specific types, and biochemical 
confirmation is possible for several varieties.
