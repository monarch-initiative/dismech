Small-bowel surveillance is recommended from the age of 8 years in asymptomatic 
individuals with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Because intussusception and risk of 
strangulated ileus were noted in an 11-year-old patient, small-bowel 
surveillance should be reliably performed from the age of 8 years to avoid 
urgent surgery.
