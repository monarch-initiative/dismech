# Study of Factors of Genetic Susceptibility Associated to Severe Caries Phenotype in Young Patients. First Approach by Systematic Screening of Candidate Genes

## Content

Alteration of the post- eruptive enamel microstructure due to a mutation of a gene coding for a matrix protein could increase the susceptibility of the enamel to caries after tooth eruption. To identify in young patients with severe caries incidence, the occurrence of mutations in several candidate genes which result in an alteration of the enamel microstructure that could explain the high caries susceptibility of the patient.
