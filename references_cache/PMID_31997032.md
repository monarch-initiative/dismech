BACKGROUND: In previous studies, authors use ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) to 
analyze the characteristics of cyclitic membranes and the associated 
complications in patients with pars planitis. However, there are no reports 
regarding the prevalence of cyclitic membranes or complications at diagnosis and 
during follow-up.
PURPOSE: To describe the characteristics and complications of cyclitic 
membranes, as determined by UBM in patients with pars planitis using AVISO-S™ 
(Quantel Medical) equipment with a 50-MHz linear probe with a focus at the pars 
plana.
DESIGN: This retrospective study reviewed UBM images of patients diagnosed with 
pars planitis, from the Inflammatory Eye Disease Clinic in Mexico City from 
January 2010 to June 2016.
RESULTS: Cyclitic membranes were observed in the first UBM image in 67 eyes 
(56.7%) and during follow-up in 81 eyes (68.62%). In 67 eyes (82.71%), the 
cyclitic membranes extended through one or two quadrants. Extension toward the 
posterior lens capsule was recognized in 15 eyes (18.52%) and extension toward 
the peripheral retina in 12 eyes (14.81%). Complications included ciliary body 
detachments in 10 eyes (12.35%) and peripheral retinal traction in 8 eyes 
(9.88%).
CONCLUSIONS: UBM is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of cyclitic membranes at 
admittance and during follow-up of patients with pars planitis; it helps the 
clinician to detect this complication early.
