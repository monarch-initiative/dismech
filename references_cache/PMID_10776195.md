Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a health problem that affects numerous 
infants and children in the United States. Approximately 4000 to 6000 new 
infections occur each year in children and adolescents; most often they become 
infected without obvious clinical manifestations. Some persons become 
chronically infected, and this asymptomatic chronically infected population 
serves as a reservoir for HBV. Immunization of all newborn infants and 
adolescents for HBV is a vital step toward eradicating HBV from the general 
population. Pediatric nurse practitioners are in a strategic position to provide 
education and the carry out immunization efforts that will dramatically decrease 
the morbidity associated with HBV.
