Nutrition therapy of Crohn's disease is considered the first-line of treatment 
for Crohn's disease in children, especially in Europe. This article discusses 
the role, mechanism, and the available updated evidence supporting use of this 
treatment to induce and maintain remission of Crohn's disease. It also 
highlights the importance of the team approach in achieving success using this 
treatment. Future research-related topics are briefly summarized.
