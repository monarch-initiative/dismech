The Holt-Oram syndrome or atriodigital dysplasia is an autosomal dominant 
disorder with near complete penetrance and variable expression, caused by 
mutations of the TBX5 gene (12q24.1), affecting one in 100 000 live births. 60% 
of cases are familial and 40% sporadic. We present the case of a 24 years old 
male patient with a personal history of bilateral coxa vara surgically corrected 
on the right at the age of 8 years, complicated by osteochondritis, short 
stature (160 cm), underweight (37 kg, BMI 14.45 kg/cm(2)), triangular face, 
micrognathia, down slanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, low set ears, 
scoliosis, narrow shoulders, shortened left arm, left thumb agenesia, limited 
supination, abnormal toes, hypoplastic muscles, atrial septal defect ostium 
secundum type, incomplete right bundle branch block, hypoacusia and normal 
intelligence.
