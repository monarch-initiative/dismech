Dengue infection can have spectrum of manifestations, often with an 
unpredictable clinical progression and outcome. There have been increasing 
reports of atypical manifestations. Abdominal pain or tenderness and persistent 
vomiting (warning signs) are present in the majority of cases with severe dengue 
prior to clinical deterioration. We report a 10-year-old child who presented 
with fever, persistent vomiting, and abdominal pain. A diagnosis of acute 
pancreatitis was made. This is a very infrequently reported complication of 
dengue hemorrhagic fever.
