# A Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of a Single Infusion of MK-6072 (Human Monoclonal Antibody to Clostridium Difficile Toxin B), and MK-3415A (Human Monoclonal Antibodies to Clostridium Difficile Toxin A and B) in Patients Receiving Antibiotic Therapy for Clostridium Difficile Infection (MODIFY II)

## Content

MK-3415A is the combination of monoclonal antibodies to Clostridium (C.) difficile toxin A (MK-3415) and toxin B (MK-6072). This study will investigate whether: 1) treatment with MK-6072 or MK-3415A in addition to standard of care (SOC) antibiotic therapy will decrease Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI) recurrence compared with placebo; and 2) MK-6072 and MK-3415A will be generally well tolerated in participants receiving SOC therapy for CDI compared with placebo.
