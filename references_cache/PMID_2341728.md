An outbreak of cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae O1, biotype el tor, serotype 
Ogawa, phage type 4, was reported in a psychiatric hospital in Singapore. A 
total of 74 inmates (18 symptomatic and 56 asymptomatic) were infected; two of 
them died. Extensive epidemiological investigations showed that the organism was 
not transmitted by contaminated food or water but through close person-to-person 
contact. Early recognition of the outbreak and prompt implementation of epidemic 
control measures comprising surveillance of diarrhoea, rectal swabbing of all 
asymptomatic inmates, isolation of those found to be infected, maintenance of a 
high standard of environmental sanitation and mass chemoprophylaxis with 
doxycycline, rapidly brought the outbreak under control.
