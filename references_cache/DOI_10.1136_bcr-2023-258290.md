## Content

Audiovestibular symptoms following COVID-19 have been long acknowledged, especially in adults. However, acute labyrinthitis presenting as an early manifestation of COVID-19 has not been reported in children. We report COVID-19-induced acute labyrinthitis in a teenager. We report on a boy in his early adolescence with a sudden onset of spinning sensation, imbalance and unilateral hearing loss with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Vestibular investigations point towards right labyrinthine hypofunction, and an audiometry test revealed right-sided severe hearing loss. Symptoms improved gradually with steroids and vestibular rehabilitation therapy. However, the long-term repercussions of post-COVID-19 acute labyrinthitis are unknown and must be followed up closely. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of acute labyrinthitis secondary to COVID-19 in paediatrics. Additionally, we conducted a literature search to elucidate the outcome of COVID-19-induced acute vestibular syndrome in children.
