Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue 
disorders characterized by hyperextensibility, delayed wound healing, joint 
hypermobility, thin skin, easy bruising, tissue fragility, "cigarette-paper" 
scarring over bony prominences, mitral valve prolapse, and other findings. There 
are 6 main types of EDS. Regardless of presentation as a chief concern or an 
incidental finding, physicians should be aware that the prominent skin findings 
of EDS are cutaneous signs of an important systemic disorder.
