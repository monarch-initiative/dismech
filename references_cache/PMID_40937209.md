This case report discusses a 29-year-old male with severe obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD) who presented with food-related obsessions and compulsions, 
leading to extreme malnutrition, reflected in a dangerously low body mass index 
of 13.7 kg/m². His obsessions revolved around keeping his digestive tract 
completely empty to avoid illness. To achieve this, he restricted his food 
intake, spent long hours in the toilet, and engaged in excessive washing. These 
behaviors resulted in significant physical deterioration that eventually 
required emergency medical intervention. Unfortunately, the initiation of 
treatment led to refeeding syndrome, which further complicated the case. Due to 
his unique symptoms and acute presentation, this case highlights the diagnostic 
and therapeutic challenges posed by atypical presentations of OCD. It reinforces 
the importance of a multidisciplinary team involving medical, psychiatric, and 
nutritional departments working collaboratively. Close monitoring for 
complications, such as refeeding syndrome, is essential. Psychoeducation for 
both patients and families remains crucial to support adherence to the treatment 
plan and improve outcomes.
