Traveler's diarrhea is the most common travel disease in both children and 
adults. Adult guidelines for traveler's diarrhea have been established, but 
significant gaps persist in guidance for the evaluation and management of 
pediatric traveler's diarrhea. Adult guidelines are not necessarily applicable 
in children, and it is essential for clinicians to account for the differences 
in pediatric pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and treatment 
recommendations when evaluating and managing pediatric traveler's diarrhea.
