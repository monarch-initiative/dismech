[Venous thromboembolism in antiphosholipid syndrome].

[Article in Czech]

Buliková A, Penka M.

Antiphosholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by the presence of clinical and 
laboratory criteria, it means by presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Venous 
thromboembolism belongs to the most frequent clinical manifestation of this 
syndrome. Here we summarised basic pathophysiological mechanisms of venous 
thrombosis and lung embolism development, epidemiology of APS, and also the 
situations when this syndrome should be considered. The possible difficulties of 
laboratory diagnosis and their therapy involvement are mentioned.
