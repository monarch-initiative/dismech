BACKGROUND: Houge-Janssens syndrome type 2 (HJS2, OMIM 616362) is a rare 
neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in PPP2R1A, typically 
characterized postnatally by hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual 
disability, and distinctive craniofacial features.
METHODS: We describe a 28-year-old pregnant woman referred for increased nuchal 
translucency (4.4 mm) and high risk on first trimester screening. Noninvasive 
prenatal testing showed no common aneuploidies. At 23 weeks of gestation, fetal 
ultrasound revealed ventriculomegaly and suspected partial agenesis of the 
corpus callosum. Genetic testing included karyotyping, chromosomal microarray 
analysis (CMA), and trio-based whole exome sequencing (WES).
RESULTS: Karyotype and CMA were normal. WES identified a de novo heterozygous 
missense variant in PPP2R1A, NM_014225.6: c.548G>A (p.R183Q), classified as 
pathogenic. Following genetic counseling, the couple elected to terminate the 
pregnancy. Integrating our findings with 12 previously reported prenatal cases, 
we conducted a systematic review of fetal phenotypes associated with PPP2R1A 
variants. The most common features were ventriculomegaly (92%), agenesis or 
dysgenesis of the corpus callosum (50%), and congenital heart defects (42%).
CONCLUSION: We present the most comprehensive synthesis to date of prenatal 
phenotypes associated with PPP2R1A-related neurodevelopmental disorders. These 
findings provide crucial insights into the prenatal spectrum of HJS2 and 
highlight key sonographic indicators to support early diagnosis and genetic 
counseling.
