Potassium channels are a heterogeneous group of membrane-bound proteins, whose 
functions support a diverse range of biological processes. Genetic disorders 
arising from mutations in potassium channels are classically recognized by 
symptoms arising from acute channel dysfunction, such as periodic paralysis, 
ataxia, seizures, or cardiac conduction abnormalities, often in a patient with 
otherwise normal examination findings. In this chapter, we review a distinct 
subgroup of rare potassium channelopathies whose presentations are instead 
suggestive of a developmental disorder, with features including intellectual 
disability, craniofacial dysmorphism or other physical anomalies. Known 
conditions within this subgroup are: Andersen-Tawil syndrome, Birk-Barel 
syndrome, Cantú syndrome, Keppen-Lubinsky syndrome, Temple-Baraitser syndrome, 
Zimmerman-Laband syndrome and a very similar disorder called Bauer-Tartaglia or 
FHEIG syndrome. Ion channelopathies are unlikely to be routinely considered in 
the differential diagnosis of children presenting with developmental concerns, 
and so detailed description and photographs of the clinical phenotype are 
provided to aid recognition. For several of these disorders, functional 
characterization of the genetic mutations responsible has led to identification 
of candidate therapies, including drugs already commonly used for other 
indications, which adds further impetus to their prompt recognition. Together, 
these cases illustrate the potential for mechanistic insights gained from 
genetic diagnosis to drive translational work toward targeted, disease-modifying 
therapies for rare disorders.
