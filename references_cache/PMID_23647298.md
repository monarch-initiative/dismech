In the last decade, new insights in molecular biology have changed the 
therapeutic landscape of non-small-cell lung cancer. Since 2004, when activating 
mutations of the EGFR were firstly identified, several genetic aberrations have 
been discovered, mainly in adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutations are a relatively 
frequent event in non-small-cell lung cancer, generally consisting of exon 19 
deletion or exon 21 substitution. In adenocarcinoma, additional rare mutations 
are detectable in the EGFR gene, as well as in other genes, including ALK, ROS1, 
RET, HER2 and BRAF. Recent studies in squamous cell carcinoma identified TP53 as 
the most frequent mutation, followed by additional more rare mutations, 
including PI3KCA, PTEN, DDR2 and FGFR. The aim of the present review is to 
analyze the potential prognostic and predictive role of rare mutations.
