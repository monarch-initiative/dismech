Drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) infections are on the rise and antibiotics that 
inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis through a novel mechanism could be an 
important component of evolving TB therapy. Protein kinase A (PknA) and protein 
kinase B (PknB) are both essential serine-threonine kinases in M. tuberculosis. 
Given the extensive knowledge base in kinase inhibition, these enzymes present 
an interesting opportunity for antimycobacterial drug discovery. This study 
focused on targeting both PknA and PknB while improving the selectivity window 
over related mammalian kinases. Compounds achieved potent inhibition (Ki ≈ 5 nM) 
of both PknA and PknB. A binding pocket unique to mycobacterial kinases was 
identified. Substitutions that filled this pocket resulted in a 100-fold 
differential against a broad selection of mammalian kinases. Reducing 
lipophilicity improved antimycobacterial activity with the most potent compounds 
achieving minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 3 to 5 μM (1-2 μg/mL) 
against the H37Ra isolate of M. tuberculosis.
