Type 5 diabetes mellitus (T5DM), recently redefined as malnutrition-related 
diabetes, represents a distinct form of severe insulin-deficient diabetes that 
arises from chronic undernutrition, particularly during childhood and 
adolescence. Unlike type 1 and type 2 diabetes, T5DM is neither 
autoimmune-mediated nor primarily driven by insulin resistance. Instead, it 
results from impaired pancreatic development and disrupted insulin signaling 
pathways due to prolonged nutritional deficiencies. This commentary proposes the 
formal adoption of "malnutrition-related diabetes" as the nomenclature for T5DM 
to more accurately reflect its etiology and clinical features. The condition is 
disproportionately prevalent in low and middle income countries, where 
malnutrition remains widespread and access to advanced diabetes care is limited. 
Accurate recognition and classification of T5DM are critical for developing 
appropriate diagnostic criteria, management strategies, and public health 
policies. Treatment typically focuses on nutritional rehabilitation and 
cost-effective oral antidiabetic therapies, rather than insulin dependence. 
Establishing malnutrition-related diabetes as a distinct category will support 
targeted research, improve patient outcomes, and raise awareness of its growing 
burden in vulnerable populations. This commentary urges the global health 
community to recognize malnutrition-related diabetes as a pressing metabolic 
disorder requiring urgent attention in low resource settings.
