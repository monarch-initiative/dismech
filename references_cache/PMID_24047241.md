BACKGROUND: Cholera mainly affects developing countries where safe water supply 
and sanitation infrastructure are often rudimentary. Sub-Saharan Africa is a 
cholera hotspot. Effective cholera control requires not only a professional 
assessment, but also consideration of community-based priorities. The present 
work compares local sociocultural features of endemic cholera in urban and rural 
sites from three field studies in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo 
(SE-DRC), western Kenya and Zanzibar.
METHODS: A vignette-based semistructured interview was used in 2008 in Zanzibar 
to study sociocultural features of cholera-related illness among 356 men and 
women from urban and rural communities. Similar cross-sectional surveys were 
performed in western Kenya (n = 379) and in SE-DRC (n = 360) in 2010. Systematic 
comparison across all settings considered the following domains: illness 
identification; perceived seriousness, potential fatality and past household 
episodes; illness-related experience; meaning; knowledge of prevention; 
help-seeking behavior; and perceived vulnerability.
RESULTS: Cholera is well known in all three settings and is understood to have a 
significant impact on people's lives. Its social impact was mainly characterized 
by financial concerns. Problems with unsafe water, sanitation and dirty 
environments were the most common perceived causes across settings; nonetheless, 
non-biomedical explanations were widespread in rural areas of SE-DRC and 
Zanzibar. Safe food and water and vaccines were prioritized for prevention in 
SE-DRC. Safe water was prioritized in western Kenya along with sanitation and 
health education. The latter two were also prioritized in Zanzibar. Use of oral 
rehydration solutions and rehydration was a top priority everywhere; healthcare 
facilities were universally reported as a primary source of help. Respondents in 
SE-DRC and Zanzibar reported cholera as affecting almost everybody without 
differentiating much for gender, age and class. In contrast, in western Kenya, 
gender differentiation was pronounced, and children and the poor were regarded 
as most vulnerable to cholera.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive review identified common and distinctive 
features of local understandings of cholera. Classical treatment (that is, 
rehydration) was highlighted as a priority for control in the three African 
study settings and is likely to be identified in the region beyond. Findings 
indicate the value of insight from community studies to guide local program 
planning for cholera control and elimination.
