INTRODUCTION: Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) patients often have 
myositis, however, myopathological and clinical data for MCTD are limited. 
Recent reports have shown that the pathology of MCTD myositis resembles that of 
immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), whereas earlier reports described 
perifascicular atrophy or inflammatory infiltrates predominantly in the 
perivascular region in MCTD myositis. We aim to describe the clinical and 
myopathological features of MCTD myositis.
METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and myopathological findings of nine myositis 
patients with U1-RNP antibodies who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MCTD.
RESULTS: Eight patients had muscle weakness in the proximal extremities, and 
overall, six patients had atypical weakness in the face, neck, wrist, or 
fingers. Four of those patients required additional intensive treatment 
(intravenous immunoglobulin or methylprednisolone). Therapeutic responses were 
consistently favorable overall, and there were no deaths during the observation 
period. In biopsied muscle specimens, common findings were mild myogenic change, 
increased necrotic and regenerating fibers, and inflammatory infiltrates 
predominating in the perivascular region. Two specimens were classified into the 
spectrum of dermatomyositis (DM); the remaining seven specimens, which had a 
smaller number of necrotic fibers and nonspecific infiltration, were 
unclassifiable.
DISCUSSION: Patients with MCTD myositis often exhibit an axial or atypical 
distribution of muscle weakness, which may require intensive therapy. 
Histological study demonstrates the heterogeneity of myopathology of MCTD 
myositis and suggests that DM and underlying vasculopathy might be present in 
these patients.
