Abnormal visceral patterning has been known for centuries. However, it has not 
been associated with ciliary dysfunction until recently. Overlapping clinical 
entities including situs inversus, certain infertility disorders, as well as 
chronic respiratory infections have their roots in abnormal ciliary function. 
Current research focuses on causative factors and genes involved in signal 
transduction pathways that define ciliary function and structure, as well as 
treatment. In this review, attempts are made to outline selected, yet key topics 
related to ciliary function in health and disease.
