## Content

Background/Objectives: Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary small vessel disease leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in genetic diagnosis, the underlying pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Proteomic studies offer insights into disease mechanisms by identifying altered protein expression patterns. Here, we conducted a proteomic analysis to elucidate molecular pathways associated with CADASIL. Methods: We enrolled genetically diagnosed CADASIL patients and healthy, genetically related controls. Plasma samples were subjected to proteomic analysis using the Olink platform, measuring 552 proteins across six panels. The data were analyzed from several approaches by using three different statistical methods: Exploratory Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares–Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), differential expression with moderated t-test, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In addition, bioinformatics analysis, including volcano plot, heatmap, and Variable Importance on Projection (VIP) scores from the PLS-DA model were drawn. Results: Significant differences in protein expression were observed between CADASIL patients and controls. RSPO1 and FGF-19 exhibited elevated levels (p < 0.05), while PPY showed downregulation (p < 0.05) in CADASIL patients, suggesting their involvement in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, MIC-A/B expression varied significantly between patients with mutations in exon 4 versus exon 11 of the NOTCH3 gene (p < 0.05), highlighting potential immunological mechanisms underlying CADASIL. We identified altered pathways using GSEA, applied after ranking the study data. Conclusions: Our study provides novel insights into the proteomic profile of CADASIL, identifying dysregulated proteins associated with vascular pathology, metabolic dysregulation, and immune activation. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of CADASIL pathophysiology and may inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Further research is warranted to validate these biomarkers and elucidate their functional roles in disease progression.
