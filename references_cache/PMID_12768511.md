Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in Western 
countries. The benefits presently observed with the approved treatments are 
mainly symptomatic without clear evidence of neuroprotection. 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have very extensive therapeutic 
potential in several central nervous system disorders and can be used as 
neuroprotective treatment in chronic neurodegenerative diseases and as 
symptomatic treatment in other neurologic diseases as epilepsy. Memantine, an 
antagonist of the glutamatergic NMDA receptor, has been recently approved for 
the treatment of advanced AD. Due to its action mechanism, memantine is 
considered a neuroprotective drug, whose utility has been demonstrated in 
preclinical studies, and a useful symptomatic treatment for AD and vascular 
dementia. We will review both aspects as well as the basic mechanisms mediating 
glutamatergic neurodegeneration and the implication of glutamate in cognition.
