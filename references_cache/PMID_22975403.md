Hypotension is defined by a low blood pressure either permanently or only in 
upright posture (orthostatic hypotension). In contrast to hypertension, there is 
no threshold defining hypotension. The occurrence of symptoms for systolic and 
diastolic measurements respectively below 90 and 60 mm Hg establishes the 
diagnosis. Every acute hypotensive event should suggest shock, adrenal failure 
or an iatrogenic cause. Chronic hypotension from endocrine origin may be linked 
to adrenal failure from adrenal or central origin, isolated hypoaldosteronism, 
pseudohypoaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, neuro-endocrine tumors (carcinoïd 
syndrome) or diabetic dysautonomia. Hypotension related to hypoaldosteronism 
associates low blood sodium and above all high blood potassium levels. They are 
generally classified according to their primary (hyperreninism) or secondary 
(hyporeninism) adrenal origin. Isolated primary hypoaldosteronisms are rare in 
adults (intensive care unit, selective injury of the glomerulosa area) and in 
children (aldosterone synthase deficiency). Isolated secondary hypoaldosteronism 
is related to mellitus diabetes complicated with dysautonomia, kidney failure, 
age, iatrogenic factors, and HIV infections. In both cases, they can be 
associated to glucocorticoid insufficiency from primary adrenal origin (adrenal 
failure of various origins with hyperreninism, among which congenital 21 
hydroxylase deficiency with salt loss) or from central origin (hypopituitarism 
with hypo-reninism). Pseudohypoaldosteronisms are linked to congenital (type 1 
pseudohypoaldosteronism) or acquired states of resistance to aldosterone. 
Acquired salt losses from enteric (total colectomy with ileostomy) or renal 
(interstitial nephropathy, Bartter and Gitelman syndromes…) origin might be 
responsible for hypotension and are associated with 
hyperreninism-hyperaldosteronism. Hypotension is a rare manifestation of 
pheochromocytomas, especially during surgical removal when the patient has not 
been prepared with calcium inhibitors. Every flush with hypotension should 
suggest a carcinoid crisis, which is very sensitive to subcutaneous somatostatin 
analog. An accurate etiological diagnosis should allow treat efficiently 
endocrine hypotension without inducing hypertension in supine posture.
