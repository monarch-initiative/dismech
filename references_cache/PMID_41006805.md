Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations 
in ATP7B, which is marked by defective copper metabolism that leads to toxic 
copper buildup in organs such as the liver and brain, ultimately causing 
hepatocellular injury and liver fibrosis. This review systematically examined 
the multifaceted mechanisms through which copper overload drives liver fibrosis. 
In short, copper ions generate reactive oxygen species via the Fenton reaction, 
thereby directly impairing the mitochondrial structure and function and inducing 
hepatocyte apoptosis, necrosis, and cuproptosis. Copper ions also activate 
signaling pathways such as the TGF-β1/Smad and NF-κB pathways, which stimulate 
hepatic stellate cells and promote their transdifferentiation into 
collagen-secreting myofibroblasts, which then accelerate extracellular matrix 
deposition. Moreover, abnormal lipoylation of the copper-dependent proteins 
metal-binding domain of ferredoxin 1 and dihydrolipoamide transacetylase causes 
mitochondrial protein oligomer buildup and tricarboxylic acid cycle dysfunction, 
reinforcing an "oxidative damage-inflammation-fibrosis" vicious cycle. The 
disruption of copper chaperones and lysosomal copper accumulation further 
intensifies oxidative stress and dysregulates the immune microenvironment. 
Current therapies focus mainly on copper chelation but exhibit limited ability 
to reverse established fibrosis. Meanwhile, emerging gene therapies face the 
challenges of delivery efficiency and immunogenicity. Future research should 
therefore elucidate the dynamic interplay between copper metabolism and the 
liver microenvironment, identify key regulatory nodes across different disease 
stages, and shift treatment paradigms from narrow "symptomatic copper chelation" 
to integrated strategies aimed at restoring copper homeostasis. Such advances 
could yield novel approaches toward the prevention and treatment of WD liver 
fibrosis.
