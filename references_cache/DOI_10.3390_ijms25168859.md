## Content

Stargardt disease, one of the most common forms of inherited retinal diseases, affects individuals worldwide. The primary cause is mutations in the ABCA4 gene, leading to the accumulation of toxic byproducts in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and subsequent photoreceptor cell degeneration. Over the past few years, research on Stargardt disease has advanced significantly, focusing on clinical and molecular genetics. Recent studies have explored various innovative therapeutic approaches, including gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and pharmacological interventions. Gene therapy has shown promise, particularly with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors capable of delivering the ABCA4 gene to retinal cells. However, challenges remain due to the gene’s large size. Stem cell therapy aims to replace degenerated RPE and photoreceptor cells, with several clinical trials demonstrating safety and preliminary efficacy. Pharmacological approaches focus on reducing toxic byproduct accumulation and modulating the visual cycle. Precision medicine, targeting specific genetic mutations and pathways, is becoming increasingly important. Novel techniques such as clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 offer potential for directly correcting genetic defects. This review aims to synthesize recent advancements in understanding and treating Stargardt disease. By highlighting breakthroughs in genetic therapies, stem cell treatments, and novel pharmacological strategies, it provides a comprehensive overview of emerging therapeutic options.
