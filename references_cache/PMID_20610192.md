Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is characterized by absence of the enteric nervous 
system in a variable portion of the distal gut. Affected infants usually present 
in the days after birth with bowel obstruction. Despite surgical advances, 
long-term outcomes remain variable. In the last 2 decades, great advances have 
been made in understanding the genes and molecular biological mechanisms that 
underlie the disease. In addition, our understanding of normal enteric nervous 
system development and how motility develops in the developing fetus and infant 
has also increased. This review aims to draw these strands together to explain 
the developmental and biological basis of HSCR, and how this knowledge may be 
used in the future to aid children with HSCR.
