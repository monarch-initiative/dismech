We report on a 15-year-old boy with stenosis and occlusion of multiple cranial, 
renal, and celiac arteries, aneurysm of the basilar artery, bilateral cutaneous 
syndactyly between fingers IV-V, partial cutaneous syndactyly between fingers 
III-IV on the right hand, brachydactyly, and borderline mental retardation. The 
clinical course was characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, gastritis, and 
high blood pressure. The pattern of the clinical and radiological findings is 
different from fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and Moyamoya disease, and highly 
suggestive of a syndrome described by Grange in four siblings (MIM#602531) 
Grange et al. [1998: Am J Med Genet 75: 469-480].
