Transthyretin-related (ATTR) amyloidosis is a progressive, multisystem disease 
caused by the extracellular deposition of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) monomers 
as insoluble amyloid fibrils. Clinical manifestations vary widely and may 
include cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), or mixed phenotypes. 
The condition is increasingly recognized as an underdiagnosed contributor to 
heart failure, particularly in elderly patients. ATTR amyloidosis exists in two 
major forms: hereditary (ATTRv), resulting from mutations in the TTR gene, and 
wild-type (ATTRwt), typically affecting men over 70 years of age. Advances in 
disease understanding have led to a paradigm shift in management, with the 
introduction of targeted therapies that slow disease progression and improve 
prognosis. First-generation therapies such as tafamidis have demonstrated 
survival benefits in ATTR-CM. More recently, second-generation agents-such as 
the TTR stabilizer acoramidis and RNA silencers including vutrisiran and 
eplontersen-have shown promising efficacy in clinical trials. Additional 
strategies under investigation include gene editing and monoclonal antibodies 
targeting TTR amyloid deposits. This review outlines current diagnostic 
strategies and therapeutic options for ATTR amyloidosis, emphasizing the need 
for early detection and individualized treatment approaches. The expanding 
therapeutic landscape highlights the importance of accurate phenotyping and 
timely intervention to optimize clinical outcomes.
