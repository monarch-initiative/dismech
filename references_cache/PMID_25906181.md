Genetic variations in the autophagic pathway influence genetic predispositions 
to Crohn disease. Autophagy, the major lysosomal pathway for degrading and 
recycling cytoplasmic material, constitutes an important homeostatic cellular 
process. Of interest, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ATG16L1 
(autophagy-related 16-like 1 [S. cerevisiae]), a key component in the autophagic 
response to invading pathogens, have been associated with an increased risk of 
developing Crohn disease. The most common and well-studied genetic variant of 
ATG16L1 (rs2241880; leading to a T300A conversion) exhibits a strong association 
with risk for developing Crohn disease. The rs2241880 variant plays a crucial 
role in pathogen clearance, resulting in imbalanced cytokine production, and is 
linked to other biological processes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum 
stress/unfolded protein response. In this review, we focus on the importance of 
ATG16L1 and its genetic variant (T300A) within the elementary biological 
processes linked to Crohn disease.
