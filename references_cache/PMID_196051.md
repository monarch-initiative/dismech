Peripheral neuropathy following a single exposure to arsenic. Clincal course in 
four patients with electrophysiological and histological studies.

Le Quesne PM, McLeod JG.

Four patients are described who developed a peripheral neuropathy 10 days to 3 
weeks after ingestion of a single dose of arsenic. All improved slowly, but 
after 6 to 8 years 3 of them still had abnormal neurological symptoms and signs. 
Electrophysiological studies showed reduction of motor conduction velocity and 
marked abnormalities of sensory nerve action potentials. The findings suggest 
that conduction is abnormal in at least some surviving nerve fibres. Sural nerve 
biopsies from 2 patients showed axonal degeneration, which was at an early stage 
in some fibres, even 10 weeks after intoxication.
