We report a cohort study of survival of patients with lung cancer presenting to 
a single multidisciplinary team between 1997 and 2011, according to symptoms at 
presentation. The overall median survival of the 3800 lung cases was 183 days 
(95% CI 171 to 195). There was a statistically significant difference in 
survival between the 12 symptom groups identified both without and with 
adjustment for the prognostic variables of age, gender and histology (P<0.001). 
Compared with the cough-alone symptom group, the risks of dying or HRs were 
significantly higher for the groups presenting with breathlessness (HR 1.86, 
95% CI 1.54 to 2.24, n=359), systemic symptoms (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.45, 
n=95), weight loss (HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.90 to 3.18, n=106), chest pain (HR 1.96, 
95% CI 1.56 to 2.45, n=159), cough with breathlessness (HR 1.59 95% CI 1.28 to 
1.98, n=177), neurological symptoms (HR 3.07, 95% CI 2.45 to 3.84, n=155) and 
other symptom combinations (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.40, n=1963). Cough may 
deserve particular prominence in public health campaigns.
