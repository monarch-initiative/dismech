Type 1 diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease that might not always be appreciated in view of the 
fairly young age of patients with this condition. In fact, in type 1 diabetes, 
the heart is subject to a variety of pathological insults, including accelerated 
atherosclerosis, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, and possibly intrinsic 
cardiomyopathy. Although the relation between hyperglycaemia and microvascular 
complications has been well established, a direct effect of hyperglycaemia on 
cardiovascular disease in type 1 diabetes has long been debated. More recently, 
several studies, most notably the Diabetes Control and Complications 
Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications, have clarified 
this issue and provided conclusive evidence that hyperglycaemia is indeed a 
mediator of cardiovascular risk in type 1 diabetes and that intensive diabetes 
therapy can reduce cardiovascular disease outcomes. We review current concepts 
in type 1 diabetes and the heart, focusing on recent insights into the central 
role of hyperglycaemia.
