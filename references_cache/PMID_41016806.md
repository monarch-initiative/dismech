Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of the herpesvirus family, infects more than 
90% of adults and establishes a lifelong latent infection. In addition to its 
involvement in a wide range of malignancies such as lymphomas, nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma, and gastric cancer, recent evidence has shown its potential 
association with autoimmune diseases, positioning EBV as an interdisciplinary 
research model linking virology, oncology, and immunology. Historically, EBV 
research has been hindered by technical limitations in viral culture systems and 
animal models. However, recent advances-including whole-genome cloning using 
bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), gene editing via CRISPR/Cas9, and the 
development of in vivo models such as humanized mice-have accelerated the 
elucidation of EBV' s unique life cycle and tumorigenic mechanisms. In this 
review, we discuss the evolution of techniques for generating recombinant EBVs 
and in vivo modeling, both essential for functional genetic analysis, and 
highlight our contributions to the advancement of these tools and their 
application in researching EBV-associated tumorigenesis.
