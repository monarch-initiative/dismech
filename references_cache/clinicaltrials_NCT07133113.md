# Medium-term Effects of Treatments in Autoimmune Encephalitis (META): a Real-life, Observational Prospective Study

## Content

Autoimmune encephalitides are severe neurological disorders requiring urgent treatment, even though there is no standard guideline by lack of empirical evidence. Commonly used treatments are divided into so-called first-line (steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, plasma exchanges) and second-line (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, tocilizumab, others), and may be used in association or sequentially. There is no standard practice, and initial treatment protocol may consist in first-line alone, first-line with rituximab, or first-line with dual immunosuppression (rituximab and cyclophosphamide). Absence of clear response to initial treatment in the first 4 to 6 weeks may indicate undertreatment and is generally followed by treatment escalation, mostly to dual immunosuppression. However, as the frequency of non-responders to initial treatment is unknown, it is still unclear whether dual immunosuppression should be offered to all patients from inception.
