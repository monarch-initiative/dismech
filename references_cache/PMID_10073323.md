For a number of reasons, genetics has always been thought to be involved in 
asthma. It is only now, with several approaches and tools to make population 
genetic studies possible, that studies are intensified. Using both the candidate 
gene and the positional cloning approaches, there is evidence that predisposing 
factors, if not the disease itself, are genetically transferred. In addition, 
studies on inbred island populations have further demonstrated a high 
probability of a genetically transferable link. If the genes can be identified, 
diagnostic tests or predictions regarding the response to specific therapy are 
advances that would follow.
