INTRODUCTION: Scimitar syndrome, or congenital venolobar syndrome, is a rare 
congenital heart condition that typically involves partial anomalous pulmonary 
venous drainage (PAPVD) of the right lung, right lung hypoplasia, and 
dextroposition of the heart. The incidence is estimated to be between 1 and 3 
cases per 100 000 live births. Most patients present with cardiopulmonary 
symptoms, though rare cases may involve gastrointestinal (GI) complications. We 
report a unique case of Scimitar syndrome in a 10-year-old boy presenting with 
hematemesis due to esophageal varices.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy presented with massive hematemesis, losing 
approximately 1 liter of fresh blood. After stabilization, an upper GI endoscopy 
revealed grade IV esophageal varices, which were ligated successfully. Abdominal 
ultrasound showed mild portal hypertension, and a unique vessel, identified as 
the Scimitar vein, was found draining into the left portal vein. Subsequent 
imaging confirmed right lung hypoplasia, dextroposition of the heart, and PAPVD, 
leading to the diagnosis of Scimitar syndrome. The patient was transferred 
abroad for specialized care due to limited medical facilities in Sudan.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Scimitar syndrome is often associated with severe symptoms 
in children, such as respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension. Upper GI 
bleeding in this syndrome is rare, likely resulting from portal hypertension 
caused by the anomalous drainage of the Scimitar vein into the left portal vein.
CONCLUSION: This case underscores the importance of recognizing the diverse 
complications of Scimitar syndrome, including its rare association with upper GI 
bleeding. Timely diagnosis and intervention, especially in resource-limited 
settings, are critical to managing complex congenital conditions.
