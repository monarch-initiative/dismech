Traveler's diarrhea (TD) is a global problem, and identifying the causative 
organisms of TD is important for adequate treatment. Therefore, this study 
retrospectively analyzed TD cases in patients who returned to Japan after 
traveling abroad to determine the causative organisms by travel region. We 
included patients with a final diagnosis of TD registered in the Japan Registry 
for Infectious Diseases from Abroad database from September 25, 2017, to 
September 1, 2022, from 14 medical institutions. A total of 919 patients were 
analyzed; the causative TD pathogen was identified in 188 cases (20%), of which 
154 were caused by diarrheagenic bacteria, the most common being Campylobacter 
spp. (64%). A 2.2 mg/dL C-reactive protein concentration cutoff value had some 
predictive ability for bacterial TD (negative predictive value, 89%). Therefore, 
the C-reactive protein level may help rule out bacterial diarrhea and prevent 
unnecessary antimicrobial administration when patients cannot provide a stool 
specimen.
