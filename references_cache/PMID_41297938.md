Cadmium (Cd) exposure is an emerging environmental risk factor for 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs), particularly ischemic stroke 
(IS). MicroRNAs are potential mediators linking environmental exposure to health 
hazards. However, the role of miRNAs in the development of IS triggered by Cd 
exposure remains largely unknown. In this study, we first demonstrate that Cd 
exposure, even at a relatively low dosage (4 mg/L), significantly facilitates 
the progression of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed a 
high-fat diet. This pro-atherogenic effect was accompanied by comprehensive 
disturbances in systemic and vascular cholesterol homeostasis, evidenced by 
altered plasma lipid profiles, hepatic lipid accumulation, and dysregulated 
expression of key genes governing cholesterol uptake (CD36), efflux (ABCA1), and 
hydrolysis (NCEH1) within the aortic wall. Integrated transcriptomic and 
metabolomic analyses further corroborated the profound disruption of the lipid 
metabolism pathways. Through miRNA microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and 
qRT-PCR validation, we identified miR-30d-5p and miR-504-3p as novel epigenetic 
regulators mediating Cd-induced foam cell formation. Specifically, Cd treatment 
upregulated miR-30d-5p and downregulated miR-504-3p, which directly targeted 
NCEH1 and CD36, respectively, thereby promoting intracellular lipid 
accumulation. In a case-control population (494 IS patients and 494 controls), 
plasma miR-30d-5p levels were positively associated with Cd exposure and 
partially mediated the Cd-stroke association, accounting for 16.4% of the total 
effect. Moreover, miR-30d-5p significantly improved the discrimination and 
reclassification of IS patients beyond the traditional risk factors. In summary, 
our findings reveal that Cd induces atherosclerosis by disrupting cholesterol 
homeostasis and modulating miRNA-regulated pathways with plasma miR-30d-5p 
serving as a potential biomarker and mediator for Cd-related ischemic stroke. 
Further perspective investigations are warranted to validate our findings.
