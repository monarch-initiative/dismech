Patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) require additional glucocorticoid doses 
during surgery or medical illness, but there is no universally accepted regimen 
for glucocorticoid supplementation therapy. The high doses and long duration of 
glucocorticoid coverage that have traditionally been used do not reflect the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to surgical stress and medical illness 
in normal people. While the optimal dose and duration of supplementation therapy 
have not been established, our recommendations are based on extrapolation from 
what constitutes a normal cortisol response to stress, on expert opinion derived 
from the medical literature, and on clinical experience. The recommended use of 
lower doses of glucocorticoids during surgical and medical stress should not 
de-emphasise the importance of additional supplementation during such events. 
Our recommendations do not replace clinical judgement, but their use will ensure 
that patients with AI are safely managed during illness or surgery without the 
risk of an adrenal crisis or excessive steroid dosing.
