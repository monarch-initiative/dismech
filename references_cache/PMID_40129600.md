INTRODUCTION: Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS) is characterized by the presence of 
dynamic, continuous, tiny dots in the entire visual field persisting for more 
than three months, with at least two associated symptoms- palinopsia, photopsia, 
photophobia, or nyctalopia. VSS was introduced as perpetual visual disturbance 
representing TV static, based on early case reports from 1995. Despite its 
recognition, VSS management remains vague as many cases are refractory to 
treatment. This literature review aims to provide a summary of all attempted 
treatments and efficacies to help physicians manage VSS.
METHODS: The authors performed a search of articles, literature reviews, and 
case reports using PubMed and Google Scholar with the key words "visual snow" 
and "treatment". Forty-one publications were identified; however, 14 were 
excluded as they did not discuss treatment options or focused on medical 
conditions associated with visual snow, such as migraine with aura. 27 articles 
were found to be relevant (from 1999-2024) with treatments in patients 
officially diagnosed with VSS. Treatments included pharmacotherapy, tinted 
lenses, neuromodulation, and behavioral therapy.
RESULTS: Based on this review of 27 publications, benzodiazepines and 
lamotrigine had the best effect (71.4% and 61.5% of patients had an improvement 
of VS symptoms on each medication, respectively). Antidepressants and AV nodal 
blocking agents were frequently prescribed but were less effective. VS symptoms 
improved with filtered lenses combined with cognitive behavioral therapy. Most 
treatments only partially alleviate VSS or manage associated symptoms like 
headache and palinopsia, rather than the visual snow itself.
CONCLUSION: The subjective nature of VSS has posed challenges. Among 
pharmacological treatments, benzodiazepines and lamotrigine have the most 
favorable therapeutic ratio in managing VSS. FL-41 tinted lenses consistently 
provide symptom relief, with cognitive behavioral therapy showing promise as an 
emerging intervention. Due to the small sample size, further research is 
recommended to enhance the applicability of findings.
