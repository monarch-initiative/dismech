BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome is a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome caused 
by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, which lead to high 
microsatellite instability and frameshift mutations at coding mononucleotide 
repeats in the genome. Recurrent frameshift mutations in these regions are 
thought to play a central role in the increased risk of various cancers, but no 
biomarkers are currently available for the surveillance of high microsatellite 
instability-associated cancers.
METHODS: A frameshift mutation-based biomarker panel was developed and validated 
by targeted next-generation sequencing of supernatant DNA from cultured high 
microsatellite instability colorectal cancer cells. This panel supported 
selection of 122 frameshift mutation targets as potential biomarkers. This 
biomarker panel was then tested using matched tumor, adjacent normal tissue, and 
buffy coat samples (53 samples) and blood-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) (38 
samples) obtained from 45 high microsatellite instability and mismatch 
repair-deficient patients. We also sequenced cfDNA from 84 healthy participants 
to assess background noise.
RESULTS: Recurrent frameshift mutations at coding mononucleotide repeats were 
detectable not only in tumors but also in cfDNA from high microsatellite 
instability and mismatch repair-deficient patients, including a Lynch syndrome 
carrier, with a varying range of target detection (up to 85.2%), whereas they 
were virtually undetectable in healthy participants. Receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis showed high sensitivity and specificity (area 
under the curve = 0.94) of the investigated panel.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that frameshift mutations can be detected in cfDNA 
from high microsatellite instability and mismatch repair-deficient patients and 
asymptomatic carriers. The 122-target frameshift mutation panel described here 
has promise as a tool for improved surveillance of high microsatellite 
instability and mismatch repair-deficient patients, with the potential to reduce 
the frequency of invasive screening methods for this high-cancer-risk cohort.
