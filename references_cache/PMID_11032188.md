Before effective vaccines became available, approximately 1 in every 200 
children aged younger than 5 years had invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b 
(Hib) disease. Hib was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis and other 
invasive bacterial diseases in this age group. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are 
essential for Hib meningitis, because the mortality rate is 2% to 5%, even with 
antibiotic treatment--usually a third-generation cephalosporin, such as 
cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. Because of the use of Hib vaccines, the incidence of 
invasive H. influenzae disease in children younger than 5 years old declined by 
97% between 1987 and 1997. Recent data indicate that the conjugate Hib vaccines 
given in infancy can be used interchangeably.
