BACKGROUND: Akinetopsia, or visual motion blindness, is a perceptual distortion 
characteristic of Alice in Wonderland syndrome in which people see moving 
objects as disjointed 'jumps' or 'freeze frames.' Despite its profound impact, 
the condition remains poorly understood beyond the established centrality of 
cortical area V5/MT in visual motion perception.
METHODS: We carried out a systematic review of case descriptions on motion 
blindness, including those where additional symptoms were described.
RESULTS: Our search yielded data on 25 clinical and 27 experimental cases, the 
latter induced by cortical stimulation. Of the clinical cases, 12% showed 
hemiakinetopsia, 50% continuous or progressive symptoms, and 52% a chronic 
course. Pathophysiologically, in right-handed individuals, the left area V5/MT 
was found to be particularly susceptible to acute interference, as evidenced by 
the experimental studies. In contrast to earlier studies, we found a greater 
prevalence of right-hemispheric afflictions in clinical cases, suggesting that 
the right area V5/MT plays a more dominant role in motion perception. Bilateral 
lesions to V5/MT most often coincided with global akinetopsia and chronicity, 
although we found that the severity of the condition also depends on surviving 
components of the visual motion network as a whole, and-in line with the dynamic 
parallellism theory-the speed of moving objects. Aetiologically, most cases were 
associated with structural neurological conditions such as stroke and 
neurodegenerative disease, and fewer with intoxications or paroxysmal 
neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Treatments were mostly successful when 
they were aimed at the underlying condition, while cases due to organic lesions 
tended to be therapy-resistant. Although individual reports confirm that 
akinetopsia may have detrimental effects on people's lives, data were 
insufficient for a proper analysis of such experiential aspects.
CONCLUSION: Phenomenologically, pathophysiologically, and etiologically, 
akinetopsia is more heterogeneous than previously thought. We provide 
recommendations for clinical practice and further scientific research.
