Background/Objectives: PPP2R1A encodes the scaffold subunit Aα of protein 
phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Pathogenic variants cause Houge-Janssens syndrome 2, a 
rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, 
intellectual disability, epilepsy, and brain malformations. We systematically 
reviewed published cases to define the clinical spectrum, characterize the 
mutational landscape, and explore genotype-phenotype correlations. Methods: We 
conducted systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from 
inception to March 2025, supplemented by GeneReviews and OMIM references. 
Studies reporting PPP2R1A variants with clinical data were included. Data 
extraction followed PRISMA guidelines, encompassing study characteristics, 
genetic findings, and phenotypic features. Results: We identified 16 studies 
representing 60 patients with PPP2R1A-related disorders. Twenty-six distinct 
pathogenic variants were identified; these were predominantly de novo 
heterozygous missense changes clustering within HEAT repeats 5-7. Recurrent 
hotspots included p.Arg182Trp (n = 12) and p.Arg183Gln (n = 5). Developmental 
delay and intellectual disability were universally present in all patients for 
whom data were available (100%, 58/58). Epilepsy occurred in 50.9% (29/57), and 
structural brain abnormalities in 83.1% (49/59), with corpus callosum 
abnormalities (40.7%, 24/59) and ventriculomegaly (32.2%, 19/59) being most 
frequent. Microcephaly was reported in 17.2% (10/58) and macrocephaly in 25.9% 
(15/58), while dysmorphic features were present in 53.4% (31/58). The phenotypic 
spectrum ranged from severe neonatal presentations with high mortality to milder 
neurodevelopmental courses, with prenatal manifestations including 
ventriculomegaly, corpus callosum abnormalities, and rare cardiac defects. Clear 
genotype-phenotype correlations emerged, with HEAT5 variants (p.Arg182Trp, 
p.Arg183Gln) associated with severe phenotypes and increased mortality, while 
p.Arg258His variants demonstrated comparatively milder courses. Conclusions: 
PPP2R1A-related disorders encompass a broad clinical spectrum ranging from 
lethal neonatal disease to survivable forms with variable neurodevelopmental 
outcomes. Prenatal features including ventriculomegaly and corpus callosum 
abnormalities enable early genetic diagnosis, informing reproductive counseling. 
Recognition of recurrent hotspot variants and their phenotype associations 
facilitates diagnosis, prognosis, and genetic counseling. These findings provide 
evidence-based guidance for clinical management and highlight the importance of 
variant-specific prognostication in this emerging neurodevelopmental disorder.
