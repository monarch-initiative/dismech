Research into the experience of the Huntington's disease (HD) family caregiver 
has established that HD carers experience a number of unique obstacles within 
their caregiving role. This appears to be due to the chronic nature of the 
disease, both in terms of genetic inheritance and the prolonged disease process 
itself. Moreover, due to the complex, physical, neurological, psychiatric and 
genetic elements of HD, service provision may often be unsuitable leaving family 
members burdened with the main responsibility of care. The complex nature of HD 
requires service providers, researchers and policy makers to consider each case 
on an individual basis, thus tailoring service provision to the user and their 
family's unique requirements.
