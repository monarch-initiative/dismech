Cholera studies. 7. Practical laboratory diagnosis.

POLLITZER R.

The first portion of this study describes in detail the different aspects of 
stool examinations, including the collection, preservation, and pooling of 
specimens, macroscopic and bacterioscopic examination, enrichment methods, and 
cultivation on a variety of solid media. The author also deals with the 
examination of vomits and of water. The performance and value of different 
identification tests (agglutination, haemolysis, and bacteriophage) and 
confirmatory tests are then considered. An annex is included on bacteriological 
procedures in the laboratory diagnosis of cholera.
