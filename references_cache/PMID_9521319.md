B and T lymphocytes are the mediators of immunity, but their function is under 
the control of dendritic cells. Dendritic cells in the periphery capture and 
process antigens, express lymphocyte co-stimulatory molecules, migrate to 
lymphoid organs and secrete cytokines to initiate immune responses. They not 
only activate lymphocytes, they also tolerize T cells to antigens that are 
innate to the body (self-antigens), thereby minimizing autoimmune reactions. 
Once a neglected cell type, dendritic cells can now be readily obtained in 
sufficient quantities to allow molecular and cell biological analysis. With 
knowledge comes the realization that these cells are a powerful tool for 
manipulating the immune system.
