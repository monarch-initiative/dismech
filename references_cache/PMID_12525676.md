Immunodeficiency alters the risk of cancer. Specific types of immune dysfunction 
are associated with different tumor risks, but most tumors are related to 
oncogenic viruses. In acquired immunodeficiency due to the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV itself rarely directly causes cancer; rather, 
it provides the immunologic background against which other viruses can escape 
immune control and induce tumors. The most common malignancies are Kaposi's 
sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This chapter discusses the pathophysiologic 
background of these tumors, how they have been affected by the use of anti-HIV 
medications, and their clinical management.
