Kawasaki disease is an acute, self-limited vascuitis that mainly occurs in 
children under 5 years of age. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has become an 
effective treatment regimen, which can effectively reduce the incidence of 
cardiovascular complications. However, there has been no consensus or clinical 
guidelines for the application of IVIG in children with Kawasaki disease till 
now. This consensus is developed based on the current research progress on the 
application of IVIG in children with Kawasaki disease in China and overseas, 
with reference to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for Kawasaki disease in 
China and overseas, and the opinions of experts. This consensus provides 
recommendations on the clinical application strategy of IVIG in children with 
Kawasaki disease and the prevention and treatment of its adverse reactions.

immunoglobulin，IVIG）已经成为一种有效的治疗方案，可以有效减少心血管并发症的发生率，但目前国内外尚无儿童川崎病IVIG应用共识或临床指南。该共识是基于目前国内外关于儿童川崎病中IVIG应用的研究进展，同时参考国内外川崎病的诊疗指南，并经过制定专家充分讨论而形成。该共识对IVIG在儿童川崎病中的临床应用策略及其不良反应的防治提出了具体建议。
