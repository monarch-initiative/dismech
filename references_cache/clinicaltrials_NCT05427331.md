Objective: To investigate whether Fecal Microbiota Transplantation(FMT) can improve sleep in patients with insomnia, its effect on gut microbiota and its metabolites, and its effect on inflammatory factors, neurotransmitters and sex hormones in peripheral blood. Methods: The study needs to recruit 60 patients with insomnia and randomly divide them into FMT capsule treatment group or Placebo treatment group. The patients were followed up before the treatment and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the treatment. The sleep status of the patients was assessed by Pittsburgh sleep quality index-PSQI, and the changes of gut microbiota and its metabolites were detected by Metagenomic sequencing and metabonomics analysis.The expression of cytokines, sex hormones and neurotransmitters in peripheral blood were detected by Elisa.
