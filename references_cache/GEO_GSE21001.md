# Infection of MK2 cells with monkeypox virus

## Content

Orthopox viruses, including monkeypox, multiply intracellularly and induce numerous changes in host genes expression. The virus target mainly humoral host response, and simultaneously, exploits other genes and functions to reproduce effectively. The goal of this experiment is to identify those host genes and functions that are essential for monkeypox virus replication.
