# Colorimetric Comparison of Email Defects Using Spectrophotometric and Computer Techniques and Biological, Structural and Physico-chemical Analyses of Teeth or Pathological Enamel

## Content

The study focuses on the analysis of enamel defects grouping together hypomineralization and hypoplasia. It focuses on 3 very characteristic enamel pathologies that are most often encountered in dental consultations: Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH), dental fluorosis (FD) and amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). The research focuses on the use of a spectrophotometer for measuring tooth colors: the Zfx SpectroShade® (MHT) and its software as a means of early diagnosis of pre-eruptive enamel abnormalities. The main objective of the study is to analyze the color parameters of teeth affected with one of the 3 enamel abnormalities for use of the spectrophotometer as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for enamel defects.

The secondary objective is focused on the biological, structural and physicochemical characterizations of these different enamel pathologies from extracted teeth or enamel biopsies that must be ground to achieve a restoration.
