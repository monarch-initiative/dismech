Ainhum is an acquired progressive condition presenting with a constriction ring 
around the fifth toe. Classically, it was reported in people of African origin 
and has been very rarely reported in India. Ainhum when diagnosed and treated 
early can be prevented from progressing to mutilating deformities. It needs to 
be differentiated from pseudo ainhum, which may have a precipitating factor, and 
careful history may reveal a preventable cause. We report a case of ainhum with 
involvement of the left fifth toe and early involvement of other toes.
