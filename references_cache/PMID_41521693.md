BACKGROUND: Ablative fractional CO2 laser is effective for acne scar treatment 
but is often associated with side effects such as erythema and dyspigmentation, 
along with prolonged recovery time.
AIMS: The study aimed to evaluate the post-procedure reparative effects of a 
combination of vitamin C, E, and ferulic acid (CE Ferulic) in Chinese patients 
with atrophic acne scars.
METHODS: In this randomized, investigator-blinded, split-face, controlled trial, 
patients aged 18-50 with moderate-to-severe atrophic acne scars were randomly 
assigned to apply CE Ferulic to intervention-side face and normal saline (NS) to 
control-side face, immediately after ablative CO2 laser treatment for 14 days. 
Patients were further divided into once-daily and twice-daily application 
subgroups. During the 14-day follow-up, the wound healing (measured by scabbing 
stage on Day 7), erythema index (EI), melanin index (MI), skin hydration, and 
transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were evaluated. Direct assessment of scar 
improvement was not within the scope of this study.
RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were included in the analysis. On Day 7, the 
intervention side showed a higher complete scab detachment rate than the control 
side (60.9% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.0026). EI and MI reduced significantly greater on 
the intervention side compared to the control side (Days 3, 7, and 14; 
p < 0.0001). On Day 14, the intervention side also demonstrated significantly 
better capability of maintaining skin hydration (p = 0.0367) and preventing TEWL 
(p = 0.0246) than the control side.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that CE Ferulic led to enhanced wound healing, 
reduced erythema and melanin levels, and improved skin hydration following laser 
treatment, suggesting its beneficial application in combination with laser 
treatment to accelerate skin recovery.
