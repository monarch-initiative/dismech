BACKGROUND: Despite minimum volume recommendations, the majority of 
esophagectomies are performed at centers with fewer than 20 annual cases. The 
present study examined the impact of institutional esophagectomy volume on 
in-hospital mortality, complications, and resource use after esophageal 
resection.
METHODS: The 2010-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried to identify 
all adult patients undergoing esophagectomy for malignancy. Hospitals were 
categorized as a high-volume hospital (HVH) if performing at least 20 
esophagectomies annually and as a low-volume hospital (LVH) if performing fewer 
than 20 esophagectomies annually. Multivariable models were developed to study 
the impact of volume on outcomes of interest, which included in-hospital 
mortality, complications, duration of hospitalization, inflation adjusted costs, 
readmissions, and nonhome discharge.
RESULTS: Of an estimated 23,176 hospitalizations, 45.6% occurred at HVHs. 
Incidence of esophagectomy increased significantly along with median 
institutional caseload over the study period, while the proportion on hospitals 
considered HVHs remained steady at approximately 7.4%. After adjusting for 
relevant patient and hospital characteristics, HVH status was associated with 
decreased mortality (AOR, 0.65), length of stay (β = -1.83), pneumonia (AOR, 
0.69), prolonged ventilation (AOR, 0.50), sepsis (AOR, 0.80), and tracheostomy 
(AOR, 0.66) but increased odds of nonhome discharge (AOR, 1.56; all P < .01), 
with LVH status as reference.
CONCLUSIONS: Many clinical outcomes of esophagectomy are improved with no 
increment in costs when performed at centers with an annual caseload of at least 
20, as recommended by patient advocacy organizations. These findings suggest 
that centralization of esophageal resections to high-volume centers may be 
congruent with value-based care models.
