A 33-day-old previously healthy term female is admitted to the pediatric 
intensive care unit with fever, lethargy and bulging fontanel. Given concern for 
meningitis, a lumbar puncture is performed and empiric treatment is initiated. 
The cerebrospinal fluid culture results reveal Pasteurella multocida. The 
patient is treated with intravenous ampicillin for 3 weeks and discharged with 
close outpatient follow-up.
