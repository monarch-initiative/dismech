BACKGROUND: Empty nose syndrome (ENS) is a condition characterized by a 
persistent feeling of nasal obstruction despite having a patent nasal airway. 
This study aims to understand prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients 
with ENS and the impact of augmentation procedures on psychological symptoms.
METHODS: The literature was searched in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. 
Outcome measures were collected for mental health prevalences and 
patient-related outcome measures (PROMs).
RESULTS: Of 1056 abstracts identified, 11 studies (N = 401 patients) were 
included. Among patients with ENS, prevalences of depression and anxiety were 
76.6% (95%CI: 61.0-89.1) and 77.0% (95% CI: 49.9-95.5). The prevalence of 
depression in patients with ENS was significantly increased compared to that of 
patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) (RR: 2.8 [95%CI: 1.5-5.2], p = 0.001) 
in studies which compared both conditions. In patients who underwent 
augmentation, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
showed no significant improvement at 6-month follow-up (5.39 [95%CI: -0.7-11.5], 
p = 0.08; 5.45 [95%CI: -2.8-13.7], p = 0.20) while Beck Depression Inventory-II 
and Beck Anxiety Inventory showed significant improvement at 6-month follow-up 
(11.94 [95%CI: 8.7-15.2], p < 0.00001; 10.83 [95%CI: 7.7-14.], p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Depression and anxiety are common among patients with ENS, with a 
possible increased prevalence of depression in patients with ENS compared to 
those with CRS. Patients with ENS demonstrated inconsistent improvement in 
depression and anxiety scores following augmentation procedures depending on the 
PROMs utilized. As patients with ENS often have mental health comorbidities, 
further research should investigate whether anxiety and depression are true 
sequelae of ENS or factors contributing to its development.
