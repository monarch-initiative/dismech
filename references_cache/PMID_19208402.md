Idiopathic adult-onset nemaline myopathy is a rare condition of unknown etiology 
that usually presents with proximal weakness. This case study reports a 
60-year-old woman who presented with isolated type 2 respiratory failure 
secondary to bilateral hemidiaphragm weakness. A left vastus medialis muscle 
biopsy examined under light microscopy revealed appearances typical of nemaline 
myopathy. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of nemaline rods in most 
muscle fibers, thus establishing idiopathic adult-onset nemaline myopathy as the 
cause of her respiratory failure. Our patient's presentation highlights the 
importance of considering neuromuscular weakness as a cause of respiratory 
failure. Unless appropriate tests are performed-including a muscle biopsy, if 
indicated-specific neuromuscular diseases are easily missed. This can lead to 
inappropriate counseling and treatment.
