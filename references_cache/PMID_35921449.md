BACKGROUND: New approaches for the prevention and elimination of malaria, a 
leading cause of illness and death among infants and young children globally, 
are needed.
METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of L9LS, a next-generation antimalarial monoclonal antibody, 
and its protective efficacy against controlled human malaria infection in 
healthy adults who had never had malaria or received a vaccine for malaria. The 
participants received L9LS either intravenously or subcutaneously at a dose of 1 
mg, 5 mg, or 20 mg per kilogram of body weight. Within 2 to 6 weeks after the 
administration of L9LS, both the participants who received L9LS and the control 
participants underwent controlled human malaria infection in which they were 
exposed to mosquitoes carrying Plasmodium falciparum (3D7 strain).
RESULTS: No safety concerns were identified. L9LS had an estimated half-life of 
56 days, and it had dose linearity, with the highest mean (±SD) maximum serum 
concentration (Cmax) of 914.2±146.5 μg per milliliter observed in participants 
who had received 20 mg per kilogram intravenously and the lowest mean Cmax of 
41.5±4.7 μg per milliliter observed in those who had received 1 mg per kilogram 
intravenously; the mean Cmax was 164.8±31.1 in the participants who had received 
5 mg per kilogram intravenously and 68.9±22.3 in those who had received 5 mg per 
kilogram subcutaneously. A total of 17 L9LS recipients and 6 control 
participants underwent controlled human malaria infection. Of the 17 
participants who received a single dose of L9LS, 15 (88%) were protected after 
controlled human malaria infection. Parasitemia did not develop in any of the 
participants who received 5 or 20 mg per kilogram of intravenous L9LS. 
Parasitemia developed in 1 of 5 participants who received 1 mg per kilogram 
intravenously, 1 of 5 participants who received 5 mg per kilogram 
subcutaneously, and all 6 control participants through 21 days after the 
controlled human malaria infection. Protection conferred by L9LS was seen at 
serum concentrations as low as 9.2 μg per milliliter.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small trial, L9LS administered intravenously or 
subcutaneously protected recipients against malaria after controlled infection, 
without evident safety concerns. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy
