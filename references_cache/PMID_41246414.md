Bovine genital campylobacteriosis (BGC) is a sexually transmitted disease caused 
by Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv). Although BGC has been reported 
globally, its prevalence is significant in developing nations where natural 
breeding is commonly employed for cow reproduction. It is found worldwide. 
Female cattle with this disease may become temporarily infertile, and a tiny 
percentage (5%-10%) of affected animals may occasionally have abortions in the 
third trimester. The subclinical manifestation of this disease in bulls, where 
there are no overt clinical signs and a protracted possible carrier stage, is a 
significant feature. Sexually transmitted Cfv can lead to reproductive issues, 
including lower cow birth rates, return of estrus, and low pregnancy rates. 
Campylobacter fetus infections in the genital tract of cows and heifers 
typically only cause mild to moderate endometritis, moderate cervicitis, and 
salpingitis. The most widely used diagnostic techniques are polymerase chain 
reaction, fluorescent antibody test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 
culture. Commercial vaccinations for BGC prevention are administered 
intramuscularly or subcutaneously and contain bacterin and adjuvant. 
BGC-positive bulls are treatable with both systemic and topical antimicrobial 
therapy. The disease is usually self-limiting, and cows may return to estrus 
after a few months. Control strategies include testing and culling of affected 
animals, vaccination of all bulls, cows, and heifers, and use of artificial 
insemination with controlled semen.
