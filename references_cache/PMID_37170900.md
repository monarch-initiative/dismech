The liver is an early systemic target of Ebola virus (EBOV), but 
characterization beyond routine histopathology and viral antigen distribution is 
limited. We hypothesized Ebola virus disease (EVD) systemic proinflammatory 
responses would be reflected in temporally altered liver myeloid phenotypes. We 
utilized multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry (mfIHC), multispectral whole 
slide imaging, and image analysis to quantify molecular phenotypes of myeloid 
cells in the liver of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; n = 21) infected with 
EBOV Kikwit. Liver samples included uninfected controls (n = 3), 3 days 
postinoculation (DPI; n = 3), 4 DPI (n = 3), 5 DPI (n = 3), 6 DPI (n = 3), and 
terminal disease (6-8 DPI; n = 6). Alterations in hepatic macrophages occurred 
at ≥ 5 DPI characterized by a 1.4-fold increase in CD68+ immunoreactivity and a 
transition from primarily CD14-CD16+ to CD14+CD16- macrophages, with a 2.1-fold 
decrease in CD163 expression in terminal animals compared with uninfected 
controls. An increase in the neutrophil chemoattractant and alarmin S100A9 
occurred within hepatic myeloid cells at 5 DPI, followed by rapid neutrophil 
influx at ≥ 6 DPI. An acute rise in the antiviral myxovirus resistance protein 1 
(MxA) occurred at ≥ 4 DPI, with a predilection for enhanced expression in 
uninfected cells. Distinctive expression of major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) class II was observed in hepatocytes during terminal disease. Results 
illustrate that EBOV causes macrophage phenotype alterations as well as 
neutrophil influx and prominent activation of interferon host responses in the 
liver. Results offer insight into potential therapeutic strategies to prevent 
and/or modulate the host proinflammatory response to normalize hepatic myeloid 
functionality.
