Asthma Genetic Association studies have been plagued by methodologic problems 
that are common in all studies of complex traits: small sample size, lack of 
replication, and lack of control of population stratification. Despite this, the 
field has identified 43 replicated genes from association studies. The most 
frequently replicated are: TNF alpha, IL4, FCERB, Adam 33, and GSTP1. Several 
genes have been identified by linkage and fine mapping (ADAM33, DPP10, GPR154, 
and PHF11) and one gene has been identified by GWAS (ORMD3). The major issue is 
that these genes have been looked at one at a time rather than in some more 
holistic manner where epistasis is considered. For asthma genetics to begin to 
have an impact on clinical medicine we need to consider epistatic interaction.
