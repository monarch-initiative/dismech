Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is a disorder characterized by abnormalities of 
growth. Previous studies of this disorder have identified a significant 
incidence of associated hearing loss. Hearing loss has been reported to occur in 
25 to 30% of affected patients. To date, all reports of associated hearing loss 
have indicated the presence of a sensorineural component. In this article, we 
report the case of a child who was diagnosed with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia 
congenita and who was found to have a significant conductive hearing loss with a 
Carhart's notch, indicating the likely presence of stapes footplate fixation. We 
also review the diagnosis of this condition and the literature associated with 
hearing loss as it occurs with this disorder.
