The monkeypox virus is endemic in Africa. However, the virus has spread 
worldwide since May 2022, and it has now been confirmed in 109 countries (as of 
September 22, 2022). Thus, an urgent investigation of the outbreak patterns of 
confirmed cases and evidence of viral infection is needed. This study 
investigated the spread of monkeypox in 109 countries, including 15 
Asian-Pacific countries, by examining the number of cases, symptoms of 
infection, and the period between diagnosis and death.
