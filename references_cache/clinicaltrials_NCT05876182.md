## Content

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is chronic fibroinflammatory disease of the liver. There is still no medical therapy proven to halt the progression of PSC or prevent its serious complications.

This is a Phase 2 randomized, double bind, placebo-controlled, monocentric study evaluating the safety and efficacy of two doses of oral vancomycin (i.e. 750 mg and 1500 mg/day) in subject between 15 - 70 years old with PSC.
