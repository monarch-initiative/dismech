From a therapeutic standpoint, vitiligo is still regarded by many physicians as 
a simple problem of regenerative medicine, with the main aim to repopulate the 
depigmented skin with functional melanocytes from the margins of the lesions or 
from intact progenitors in hair follicles. However, recent research in vitiligo 
suggests that various local triggers alert the skin immune innate system and may 
precede adaptive immune responses targeting melanocytes. This scenario is close 
to that of other common skin inflammatory disorders like psoriasis and atopic, 
and suggests to target as a priority this clinically silent inflammatory 
component of he disease. This perspective highlights possible targets for 
intervention.
