Parvovirus B19 infection is common worldwide but is often asymptomatic. However, 
the virus has been implicated in numerous disorders, including aplastic crisis 
in patients with chronic hemolytic anemia, erythema infectiosum, arthropathy, 
arthritis, and fetal infections. Diagnostic tests are not routine, but several 
are available through commercial reference laboratories. Treatment ranges from 
analgesics and antipyretics for mild and self-limited illness to administration 
of commercial immunoglobulin preparations and blood transfusion for more serious 
conditions.
