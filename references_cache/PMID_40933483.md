BACKGROUND: Meckel syndrome (MKS) is an embryonically lethal ciliopathy with 
severe clinical manifestations, including defects of the central nervous system, 
bilateral renal cystic dysplasia, and postaxial polydactyly. B9 
domain-containing 1 (B9D1, NP_056496.1) is a member of a small family of 
proteins associated with basal bodies and primary cilia in mammalian cells. B9D1 
variants are associated with MKS and Joubert syndrome. However, to date, only a 
few cases have been reported.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated a prenatally diagnosed recurrent MKS 
pedigree. Two fetuses of different sexes were conceived by nonconsanguineous 
parents. Systematic color Doppler ultrasound revealed same malformations in both 
fetuses during the second trimester, which included meningoencephalocele, 
Dandy-Walker malformation, and postaxial polydactyly. Trio whole exome 
sequencing (WES) and WES reanalysis were performed. The presence and effects of 
these variants were further validated using Sanger sequencing, RT-PCR, and 
minigene splicing assay at the DNA and RNA levels.
RESULTS: Two compound heterozygous variants, c.341G>T (p.R114L) and 
c.405-308_405-304del, were identified in both probands, each inherited from one 
unaffected parent. Both variants led to abnormal splicing. Specifically, the 
missense mutation c.341G>T caused the skipping of exon 4, whereas the novel 
deep-intronic variant c.405-308_405-304del created a new and strong acceptor 
site at c.405-294_405-293. Pathogenicity analysis indicated that both variants 
were pathogenic.
CONCLUSION: This report presents a rare pedigree of recurrent MKS, in which two 
novel mutations in B9D1 are identified. Our findings expand the mutation 
spectrum of B9D1 and provide an accurate molecular diagnosis for genetic 
counseling.
