Eyelid myoclonia with absences (EMA), or Jeavons syndrome, is a generalized 
epileptic condition clinically characterized by eyelid myoclonia (EM) with or 
without absences, eye closure-induced electroencephalography (EEG) paroxysms, 
and photosensitivity; in addition, rare tonic-clonic seizures may also occur. 
Although first described in 1977 and widely reported by several authors within 
the last few years, EMA has not been yet recognized as a definite epileptic 
syndrome. However, when strict criteria are applied to the diagnosis, EMA 
appears to be a distinctive condition that could be considered a myoclonic 
epileptic syndrome, with myoclonia limited to the eyelids, rather than an 
epileptic syndrome with absences.
