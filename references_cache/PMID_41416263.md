Prolonged mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an 
increase in dermatologic conditions, particularly irritant and allergic contact 
dermatitis. Mechanical friction, occlusion, and humidity contribute to skin 
barrier disruption and inflammation. Although most cases are self-limiting, a 
subset may evolve into chronic or steroid-dependent dermatoses. We report a case 
of a 23-year-old male healthcare professional who developed erythematous plaques 
behind the ear following continuous mask use. The lesions initially responded to 
topical betamethasone 0.05% cream but relapsed after tapering, evolving into 
chronic seborrheic inflammation with pruritus and scaling extending into the 
scalp and external auditory canal. Application of tacrolimus 0.1% ointment and 
fusidic acid cream aggravated the condition, reflecting persistent inflammation 
and barrier dysfunction. Clinical findings indicated steroid dependence and 
chronic seborrheic-type inflammation. Barrier-restoring measures and cautious 
corticosteroid withdrawal led to gradual improvement. This case highlights the 
multifactorial pathogenesis of chronic mask-related dermatitis and underscores 
the importance of barrier repair, prudent corticosteroid use, and 
interdisciplinary collaboration in managing persistent cases.
