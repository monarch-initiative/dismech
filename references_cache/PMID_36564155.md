Familial Monkeypox Virus Infection Involving 2 Young Children.

Del Giudice P, Fribourg A, Roudiere L, Gillon J, Decoppet A, Reverte M.

We report intrafamilial transmission of monkeypox virus to all members of a 
family (father, mother, and 2 children). Case reports in young children have 
been extremely rare during the 2022 mpox outbreak. Their clinical signs were 
mild, and clinical diagnosis would be difficult without knowledge of the 
father's monkeypox virus infection.
