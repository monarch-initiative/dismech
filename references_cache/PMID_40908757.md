Lichen simplex chronicus is a chronic pruritic skin condition that significantly 
impacts quality of life. This retrospective study analysed 125 patients with 
clinically confirmed lichen simplex chronicus seen at a tertiary academic centre 
to characterize itch severity, anatomical distribution, and associated 
comorbidities. Itch intensity was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale 
(NRS), and clinical data were stratified by demographics and disease extent. 
Most patients (75%) reported moderate-to-severe itch (NRS 4-10), with nearly 90% 
experiencing daily pruritus and half reporting both daytime and nocturnal 
symptoms. The limbs were the most commonly affected sites. Comorbid conditions 
were frequent, including generalized anxiety disorder (50% vs ~3% in the US 
adult population), major depressive disorder (44% vs ~8%), hypertension (61% vs 
~45%), and type 2 diabetes (30% vs ~11%). Patients with multiple-lesion lichen 
simplex chronicus had significantly higher itch severity (mean NRS 7.81 vs 7.08, 
p = 0.001) and were more likely to be female (81% vs 46%, p = 0.002) compared 
with those with localized disease. These findings highlight the high symptom 
burden and frequent co-occurrence of psychiatric and metabolic comorbidities in 
lichen simplex chronicus. Thus, early identification and management of 
psychiatric, neurological, and metabolic conditions may improve outcomes for 
patients with lichen simplex chronicus.
