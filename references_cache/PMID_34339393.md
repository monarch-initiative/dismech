Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) gene polymorphisms may be 
involved in the risk of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, evidence for the 
association remains controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to 
confirm the relationship between CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms and RA. The pooled 
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess 
the strength of association. Stratified analysis was conducted by ethnicity. In 
total, 66 case-control studies including 21681 cases and 23457 controls were 
obtained. For rs3087243 polymorphism, significant association was detected in 
Asians (A vs. G: OR=0.77, 95%CI=0.65-0.90, P=0.001; AA vs. GG: OR=0.67, 
95%CI=0.48-0.94, P=0.02) and Caucasians (A vs. G: OR=0.89, 95%CI=0.86-0.93, 
P<0.00001; AA vs. GG: OR=0.81, 95%CI=0.75-0.88, P<0.00001). For rs231775 
polymorphism, significant association was observed in the overall (G vs. A: OR 
=1.16, 95%CI=1.08-1.25, P<0.0001; GG vs. AA: OR=1.29, 95%CI=1.12-1.50, 
P=0.0006), and in Asians (G vs. A: OR=1.27, 95%CI=1.10-1.47, P=0.001; GG vs. AA: 
OR=1.58, 95%CI=1.24-2.01, P=0.0002), but not in Caucasians. However, there was 
no association between rs5742909 polymorphism and RA. This meta-analysis 
confirmed that rs3087243 and rs231775 polymorphism were associated with the risk 
of RA in both overall population and ethnic-specific analysis, but there was no 
association between rs5742909 polymorphism and RA risk.
