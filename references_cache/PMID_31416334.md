OBJECTIVES: To highlight a severe case of rhinotillexomania (compulsive nasal 
picking) and its potential to manifest as empty nose syndrome (ENS).
METHODS: A single case report with the presentation and management of a patient 
with severe rhinotillexomania who presented with chronic obstructive symptoms. 
We review the current literature on rhinotillexomania and ENS.
RESULTS: This patient's manifestations mimic the obstructive symptoms of ENS, 
despite widely patent nasal passages.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of rhinotillexomania manifesting with 
features of ENS.
