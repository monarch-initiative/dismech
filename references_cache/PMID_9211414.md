The number of children with AIDS continues to increase worldwide. Children who 
become infected with HIV-1 acquire the infection almost exclusively from their 
mothers during pregnancy or delivery, or via breast feeding. Mother-to-infant 
transmission has been, and continues to be, an area of active research with the 
goal being complete prevention. Treatment with zidovudine, an antiviral agent, 
has been found to decrease transmission from 25% to 8%. However, multiple 
obstacles impede the worldwide application of this advance.
