Lynch syndrome (LS) is caused by a pathogenic heterozygous germline variant in 
one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2. 
LS-associated colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) are characterized by MMR deficiency 
and by accumulation of multiple insertions/deletions at coding microsatellites 
(cMS). MMR deficiency-induced variants at defined cMS loci have a driver 
function and promote tumorigenesis. Notably, PMS2 variant carriers face only a 
slightly increased risk of developing CRC. Here, we investigate whether this 
lower penetrance is also reflected by differences in molecular features and cMS 
variant patterns. Tumor DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
(FFPE) tissue cores or sections (n = 90). Tumors originated from genetically 
proven germline pathogenic MMR variant carriers (including 14 PMS2-deficient 
tumors). The mutational spectrum was analyzed using fluorescently labeled 
primers specific for 18 cMS previously described as mutational targets in 
MMR-deficient tumors. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed by 
immunohistochemical detection of T-cells on FFPE tissue sections. The cMS 
spectrum of PMS2-deficient CRCs did not show any significant differences from 
MLH1/MSH2-deficient CRCs. PMS2-deficient tumors, however, displayed lower 
CD3-positive T-cell infiltration compared to other MMR-deficient cancers (28.00 
vs. 55.00 per 0.1 mm2, p = 0.0025). Our study demonstrates that the spectrum of 
potentially immunogenic cMS variants in CRCs from PMS2 gene variant carriers is 
similar to that observed in CRCs from other MMR gene variant carriers. Lower 
immune cell infiltration observed in PMS2-deficient CRCs could be the result of 
alternative mechanisms of immune evasion or immune cell exclusion, similar to 
those seen in MMR-proficient tumors.
