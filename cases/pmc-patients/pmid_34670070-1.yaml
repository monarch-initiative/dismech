diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0005147
    label: type 1 diabetes mellitus

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005148
      label: type 2 diabetes mellitus
    notes: "Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state typically associated with T2DM in adults; anti-GAD antibody positivity confirmed autoimmune T1DM"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0001410
      label: diabetic ketoacidosis
    notes: "Classic DKA expected with new T1DM; patient had HHS instead with only mild acidosis (pH 7.327) despite severe hyperglycemia"

original_case_description: |
  An adolescent male presented with polydipsia, polyuria, and drowsy mental status. Laboratory
  evaluation revealed severely elevated blood glucose at 1,456 mg/dL, hyperosmolarity of
  359 mOsm/kg (effective osmolarity 323 mOsm/kg), and mild acidosis with venous pH of 7.327.
  The patient was diagnosed with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) as the first
  manifestation of type 1 diabetes mellitus, confirmed by positivity for anti-glutamic acid
  decarboxylase antibodies. Though HHS is rarely seen in children and adolescents with T1DM,
  this case demonstrates that HHS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
  hyperglycemic emergencies in this population. Treatment with intensive intravenous fluid
  replacement and regular insulin (0.025 units/kg/hr) resulted in clinical improvement with
  no neurological complications.
