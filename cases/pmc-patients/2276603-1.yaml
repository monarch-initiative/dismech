original_case_description: |
  A seventy-year-old male presented with an episode of obscure bleeding. There was a history of gastric ulcer leading to Billroth II surgery twenty-five years ago. No medication affecting blood coagulation was taken. The patient suffered from a severe myasthenia gravis that was treated with pyridostigmine 360 mg. Extensive examination had been done to exclude neoplastic disease. Family history was negative for any neuromuscular or gastrointestinal disorders, for example, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulosis. No medication affecting blood coagulation was taken. Upper endoscopy revealed no pathology. Colonoscopy showed a few solitary diverticula and traces of old blood in the terminal ileum. Random biopsies did not show any pathology; especially no histological signs of inflammatory bowel disease were present.

  Capsule endoscopy was indicated. The patient required mechanical ventilation and could not swallow the Pillcam capsule. So a flexible tube constructed for the Endocinch system was inserted in the oesophagus. The Pillcam capsule was wrapped in a disposable net and passed endoscopically through the tube into the stomach. Avoiding the ascending jejunal loop the capsule was set free in the descending jejunal loop. The capsule pictured red smear in the upper jejunum.

  Diverticula were seen as well. Suspecting bleeding jejunal diverticulosis double balloon enteroscopy was performed. The complete ascending jejunal loop and about 100 cm of the jejunum through the descending jejunal loop could be inspected. Large diverticula with fecoliths were found in both loops. No biopsy was taken due to risk of perforation.

  Bleeding had ceased. The patient was discharged to neurology for optimizing therapy for myasthenia gravis. Azathioprin 150 mg was added.
