original_case_description: |
  A five-year-old female child, a known case of DS, presented with a history of gum bleeding, tarry stools and hematemesis of five days duration. On physical examination, she was pale and had petechiae, bleeding gums and hepatomegaly. There was an enlarged submandibular lymph node. Her coagulogram studies were unremarkable. Serum fibrinogen levels were within normal limits (2.0 g/l); and tests for fibrin degradation products and D-dimer were also negative. Hemogram findings were as follows: Hb 5 g/dl; WBC 80 × 10^3/l; and platelets 12 × 10^9/l. The peripheral smear demonstrated an increased number of WBCs, neoplastic promyelocytes and occasional blasts (90%) with high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and conspicuous nucleoli. These promyelocytes had markedly lobulated and invaginated nuclei. The cytoplasm of the cells contained no clearly recognizable granules but showed occasional Auer rods. The red cells showed mild anisocytosis with a few macrocytes. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy was performed with the following differential: 70% promyelocytes which had a morphology similar to those seen in the peripheral blood; 23% blasts; 5% myelocytes; and 2% lymphocytes. Normal hematopoiesis was suppressed. The promyelocytes were strongly positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO) stain. Periodic acid Schiff's stain was predominantly negative except for fine granular positivity in an occasional promyelocyte. Unfortunately, conventional cytogenetic analysis could not be performed.
