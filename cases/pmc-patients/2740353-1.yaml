original_case_description: |
  An 8-year-old boy presented with complaints of short stature and an abnormal gait. According to his parents, the boy was normal until 3 years of age when he developed waddling gait, deformity of lower limbs, and retarded growth. The younger sibling was also normal since birth but had started developing waddling gait around 2 years of age.

  Physical examination of the elder child revealed markedly reduced height measuring only 94 cm (<3rd percentile for age). Both the upper and lower segment length was reduced, but the limbs were disproportionately shortened. The upper segment measured 59 cm (mean for age is 65.4 cm), while the lower segment measured 35 cm (mean for age is 60 cm). The ratio of the length of the arm to forearm compartment was 0.62 and that of thigh to leg compartment was 0.69. In addition, there was limited elbow extension (up to 130° only), genu valgum deformity, and exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Systemic examination and intelligence were normal.

  The younger child was 83 cm tall (50th percentile of age is 84.10 cm) with an upper segment length of 50 cm (normal mean for age is 51.3 cm) and leg length of 33 cm (mean for age is 34 cm) and an exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Systemic examination and intelligence were normal.

  The parents were of normal height and intelligence. They, however, had a consanguineous marriage. There was no family history of dwarfism. A skeletal survey of both siblings was obtained.
