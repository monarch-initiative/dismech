  value: 50
  unit: year
gender: F
pub_date: "2008"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0005420
    label: hypothyroidism

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:

    notes: "Torsades de pointes presentation suggested congenital long QT; hypothyroidism identified as acquired cause of QT prolongation"

original_case_description: |
  A 50-years-old woman was presented to the emergency department with chest pain and dyspnea. She was a case of single kidney. She had no history of systemic disease such as diabetes and hypertension. On the day of admission she collapsed and was unresponsive for a short while. She had not suffered from any episodes of syncope before. Physical examination revealed a well nourished woman with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg and a pulse rate of 100 beats per minutes. She had a puffy face and examination of the neck revealed no struma. The jugular venous pressure was normal. Cardiac auscultation was normal and the lungs were clear. Peripheral pulses of radial, femoral and dorsalis pedis were present. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed torsades de pointes type ventricular tachycardia. The patient received Magnesium and transferred to cardiac care unit (CCU).

  Next ECG obtained from the patient revealed T wave inversion and prolongation of QT intervals of 0.71 S. So the patient received phenytoin as treatment for prolongation of QT intervals. At the third day of admission the patient developed positional vertigo and her blood pressure dropped to 80 mmHg.
