original_case_description: |
  12 yr old boy known case of hemophilia (factor VIII deficiency) diagnosed at 6 month of age presented with intermittent fever (on and off) of 2 month without chills and rigors, significant weight loss of 3 kilograms in 1 one month, generalized weakness of 1 month and joint swelling right knee of 7 days duration. The swelling was spontaneous associated with restriction of movements. There was no family history of malignancy or bleeding disorders.

  On examination, the anthropometric measurements were appropriate for age. There was pallor, petechiae and ecchymoses on his legs, along with gingival bleeding, and haematoma on right knee. Systemic examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood counts revealed hemoglobin levels of 7.6 g%, white cell counts of 41 × 109/L (blasts 85%), and platelet counts of 100 × 109/L. After receiving 40 U/kg FVIII concentrates, bone marrow aspiration was performed, which showed lymphoblast of 85%. His immunophenotype consisted of CD3 87%, CD7 99%, CD8 10%, CD5 3%, CD10 98%, CD19 18%, CD22 20% and HLA DR negative The cells were negative with MPO staining. RT-PCR for BCR abl negative. A hepatitis viruses screening test found the patient to be hepatitis B and C negative. HIV serological test was negative and cytogenetic test revealed 46, XY. Coagulation screening showed a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (test 46 seconds, control 28 seconds), with normal prothrombin time. The ultrasound scan of abdomen revealed hepatosplenomegaly, Echocardiography and Xray chest was normal.

  After admission to our center, the patient received 30 U/kg of factor VIII. The swelling and pain in his right knee subsided. The patient was placed on induction therapy on the second day, which included oral prednisolone, intrathecal methotrexate, vincristine, daunorubicin. There was no CNS involvement. He was given treatment as per CCG guidelines(Children Cancer Group) which includes 4 weeks of induction, 8 weeks of consolidation, 8 weeks of interim maintenance cycle I (8 weeks), delayed intensification I (8 weeks), delayed intensification II (8 weeks) and maintenance period of 12 weeks. The patient was given intrathecal methotrexate under the cover of factor VIII. During the induction phase there was period of febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and swelling of right knee joint which was managed with antibiotics, platelet transfusion and factor VIII. His peripheral blood counts gradually returned to normal during the treatment, and the patient did not have bleeding complications subsequently. After twenty-eight days of treatment, the patient achieved complete remission. The bone marrow done revealed blasts cells of less than 5% which was consistent with remission. He was discharged from the hospital on the 31st day of induction therapy. He has remained in good condition since then.
