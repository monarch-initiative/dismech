title: "Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the parotid metastasizing to liver: case report"
age:
  value: 60
  unit: year
gender: F
pub_date: "2004"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0004971
    label: adenoid cystic carcinoma

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0008401
      label: pleomorphic adenoma
    notes: "Most common parotid tumor; FNAC and histopathology showing cribriform pattern with perineural invasion confirmed ACC"

original_case_description: |
  A 60 year old woman presented with a small swelling beneath the right ear lobe of 4 months duration. The swelling measured 2 × 1 cm placed in the superficial part of the parotid and was not fixed. There was no facial nerve palsy or palpable cervical nodes. A fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was carried out which showed the lesion to be ACC. The clinical staging was T1, N0, M0. The patient underwent a total conservative parotidectomy after metastatic work up. Histopathology revealed ACC with cribriform pattern and perineural invasion. 60 Gy adjuvant external beam radiotherapy was administered post-operatively to the parotid area and the neck. Patient was placed on regular follow-up. Three years after primary surgery, patient presented with heaviness and pain in the right hypochondrium of 15 days duration. Patient was anicteric and abdominal examination revealed firm nodular and non tender enlargement of the liver. There was no ascites. Surgical site and neck were clinically normal. Chest roentgenogram was normal. Ultrasonography (US) of the abdomen revealed multiple metastatic lesions scattered in both lobes. Liver function tests were normal and an US guided FNAC revealed metastatic ACC. Since the lesions were multiple and scattered over both lobes of liver, surgical option was not considered and the patient was offered palliative chemotherapy which she declined. She developed pedal edema and abdominal distention 20 months after detection.
