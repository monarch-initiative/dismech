  An 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation but no prior thyroid disease presented
  with one month of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and 10 lb weight loss. His
  wife noted cognitive changes including forgetfulness, disorganized speech patterns, and daytime
  somnolence. He also reported vivid nightmares. Physical examination revealed mild tachycardia
  (100-110 bpm), irregular cardiac rhythm, and bilateral coarse hand tremors. Notably, he lacked
  a goiter or eye abnormalities. Laboratory work showed acute kidney injury (GFR 35, creatinine
  1.92). New-onset hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves disease was confirmed by elevated

  Treatment with methimazole was initiated.
