    label: mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0011429
      label: juvenile idiopathic arthritis
    notes: "Prominent arthritis with systemic features; Kawasaki criteria (fever, conjunctivitis, rash, cracked lips, desquamation) confirmed diagnosis"

original_case_description: |
  The patient was an eight year old boy presenting to his local hospital with a three day history of pyrexia, irritability, erythematous rash in the groin, bilateral knee arthritis and generalised arthralgia, and a one day history of bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis. There was no prior past medical or family history of note and he was fully immunised. Examination revealed red, cracked lips but there was no lymphadenopathy or clinically overt focus of infection. Laboratory investigations at that stage revealed haemoglobin (Hb) 12.6 g/dL (normal reference range 11.5–15.5 g/dL), white cell count (WCC) 10.6 × 10^9/L (4.5–13.5 × 10^9/L), platelets 444 × 10^9/L (150–450 × 10^9/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 80 mm/hr (0–10 mm/hr), C-reactive protein (CRP) 143 mg/L (<20 mg/L) and Albumin (Alb) 32 g/L. He was initially treated symptomatically with paracetamol, ibuprofen and broad spectrum antimicrobials, but with no response. All blood cultures and serology for infections were subsequently negative. By day 7 of illness he had persistent spiking fever up to 40.2°C, and developed desquamation of his palms and soles, and severe colicky central abdominal pain without peritonitis. He had also developed worsening arthritis in his ankles, wrists and elbows. Repeat laboratory tests revealed ongoing severe systemic acute phase responses with ESR 99 mm/hr, CRP 185 mg/L, platelets to 512 × 10^9/L and total WCC 11.5 × 10^9/L. Ultrasound of abdomen and hips and bone scan revealed no abnormality.
