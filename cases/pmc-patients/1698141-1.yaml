title: "Synchronous Multifocal Osteosarcoma: Case Report and Literature Review"
age:
  value: 21
  unit: year
gender: M
pub_date: "2006"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0009807
    label: osteosarcoma

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0012817
      label: Ewing sarcoma
    notes: "Another primary bone sarcoma in young adults; distinguished by histology showing high-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma"

original_case_description: |
  The patient was a fit and well 21-year old man who initially presented to his GP with a painful right knee with no history of trauma. This was diagnosed as a soft tissue injury, but, six months later, he noticed a swelling in his right proximal tibia. A plain x-ray showed a pathological fracture of the proximal tibia and he was referred to the regional sarcoma centre via his local fracture clinic.

  His initial investigations of blood tests, chest x-ray, and abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities, but MRI right knee clearly demonstrated an osteosarcoma in the proximal tibia with further lesions in the distal femur.

  A biopsy of the proximal tibial lesion confirmed the diagnosis of high-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy of five cycles of doxorubicin and cisplatin was commenced.

  The preoperative CT chest was clear and a further biopsy of both the distal tibial and proximal femoral lesions confirmed high-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma with necrosis. Because of this good response to chemotherapy, the decision was made to conserve the leg. Therefore, six months after diagnosis, the patient underwent resection of the right proximal tibia and distal femur.
