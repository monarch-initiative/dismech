    notes: "Small round blue cell tumor on buttock; immunohistochemistry with CK20 dot pattern confirmed Merkel cell carcinoma"

original_case_description: 'A 77 year old female presented to her primary care physician with a complaint
  of a right buttock mass. Her past medical history was significant for colonic adenocarcinoma treated
  surgically, twelve years prior. The skin overlying the 2 × 3 cm firm, non-fluctuant, non-tender mass
  was erythematous. Initially the mass was thought to be a boil or carbuncle. Six weeks later during a
  visit with a surgical oncologist for routine follow-up of her colonic adenocarcinoma resected 13 years
  prior, the patient noted that the mass was becoming quite painful and enlarging rapidly. The patient
  was then taken to the OR for local excision. Pathology revealed a small round blue cell tumor forming
  large nests and infiltrating as single cells between thick strands of fibrous tissue in the dermis and
  extending to the subcutaneous fat. There were abundant mitoses, a lack of necrosis or obvious vascular
  invasion. The epidermis was uninvolved. The histologic and immunochemical findings supported the diagnosis
  of Merkel cell carcinoma. A wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. One sentinel
  lymph node was negative for malignancy and there was no residual tumor identified in the excision. No
  adjuvant therapy was given.

  Ten months after the initial presentation the patient had increasing shoulder pain that radiated into
  the chest and flank. A CT of the thoracic spine revealed a 3.0 cm mass in the area of the fourth thoracic
  (T4) vertebra. A CT guided needle biopsy of the area revealed metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. A bone
  scan revealed additional areas of concern in the right humerus and bilateral distal femurs. The patient
  received radiation therapy to the thoracic spine and right distal femur for palliation of bone pain.

  A year after first presenting for a right buttock mass, the patient was admitted to the hospital for
  increasing dyspnea. A chest radiograph revealed a large right pleural effusion, which was drained for
  both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The fluid was grossly bloody and cytology revealed abundant,
  round, basophilic single cells, many in mitosis, with characteristic granular, "salt and pepper" nuclear
  chromatin (Figure ). A cellblock was made and immunohistochemical staining with CK20 revealed characteristic
  positivity in a dot like rim pattern (Figures ).'
