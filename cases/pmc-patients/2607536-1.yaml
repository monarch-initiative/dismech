original_case_description: |
  The patient is now 38 yr old. She commenced regular blood transfusion at 10 months of age and desferrioxamine iron chelation therapy at the age of 11 yr. In June 2001 with the availability of the oral chelator deferiprone, she commenced combination therapy with deferiprone at 60–80 mg/kg/d in three doses (25% in the morning, 25% in the afternoon and 50% at night) and desferrioxamine at 30–50 mg/kg/infusion/d. She was always very compliant with her chelation therapy. She did not show any cardiac complications, glucose and thyroid metabolism were normal. She was diagnosed as having primary amenorrhea at 16 yr of age and received hormone replacement therapy. She had osteopenia. In October 2006 with IVF she became pregnant. She delivered in June 2007 and breast fed for 2 months. She had ceased chelation therapy from October 2006 till the end of September 2007. She has given written consent to the anonymous publication of this report.

  Liver R2* (reciprocal of T2*) is linearly proportional to total iron present in an organ and a calibration equation was derived from the least squares fit of liver R2* data of patients who subsequently underwent liver biopsy vs. linear ion concentration (LIC) determined by the liver biopsies. For liver R2 vs. LIC a non-linear calibration curve was determined and a calibration equation is also available. In order to use the calibration equations for liver R2* and R2 the same protocols for determining R2 and R2* must of course be used. Our R2* data were obtained with identical protocols as described from a Los Angeles group but a different pulse sequence was used for determining R2, thus our R2 data can only be correlated to LIC in a qualitative way. For the period of the pregnancy all quantitative determinations are based on our R2* data.

  The table shows the mean ferritin levels, the red cell consumption, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as assessed by echocardiography, cardiac T2* and liver iron concentration. The initial and final LIC were determined from the MRI data were estimated to be 1.0 and 11.3 mg/g dry weight, respectively, indicative of normal and moderate to heavy iron load, respectively. The MRI-derived LVEF at the end of the pregnancy was 63%, indicating marginal normal function.

  The most striking feature of her results was the rise in the mean ferritin from 46 μg/L, just before the pregnancy to 1583 μg/L after delivery. Liver R2* rose from 1.3 mg/g dry weight to 11.3 mg/g dry weight and cardiac T2* fell mildly from 34.1 to 27.3 ms (albeit still within the normal range but with a downward trend). Even though her LVEF as assessed by MRI remained normal, it is at the lower limit of normal. She was transfused 33 times during the 9 months receiving a total of 11 417 mL of packed red blood cells. The packed red blood cells given, apart from the anticoagulant solution, are enriched with 100 mL of mannitol additive solution after plasma separation in order to prolong red blood cells conservation to 42 d instead of 35 d. Each unit is about 300–350 mL instead of 200–250 mL. The mannitol additive solution (3300 mL for the 33 units) containing only glucose is not regarded as an iron source. The 11 417 mL of packed cells given are equivalent to 8117 mL of conventional red blood cells and would translate to 6.5 g of iron input. Even though the mean pretransfusion Hb level was maintained at 10.8 g/dL her red cell consumption remained unchanged because she had gained 10 kg weight. The total amount of iron received during the pregnancy was higher than usual owing to her weight gain. The liver iron concentration before combination therapy had shown a R2 value >50/s (indicative of moderate to heavy hepatic iron loading) and by 2006 it had improved to 29.4/s.

  The liver during the 12-month chelation-free period accumulated 10.3 mg/g dry weight, i.e. 0.85 mg/g dry weight per month. This is equivalent to an increased total body iron load of 109 mg/kg and is compatible with the 6.5 g of iron she received through transfusion during the period without chelation therapy.
