original_case_description: |
  A 3-year-old girl was referred to the oncology service because of left exotropia associated with an intraocular mass. Familial history was not contributory. Examination under anesthesia revealed an elevated semitranslucent mass measuring about 9 × 8 mm in basal dimensions and 3 mm in thickness superior to the left fovea, surrounded by a margin of chorioretinal atrophy and retinal pigment epithelial alteration. Some calcification was evident in the central portion of the tumor. This retinal lesion was thought to be a retinocytoma. Five small translucent masses compatible with retinoblastoma were found in the same eye: Four in the posterior pole and the fifth near the ora serrata. Two subretinal seeds were found near the ora serrata as well. In the right eye, two small retinoblastomas were present near the optic disc and another one was found near the ora serrata. Anterior segments of both the eyes were normal. No extraocular extension and central nervous system abnormality was found in systemic evaluation and neuroimaging studies. Fundus examination of the parents with scleral indentation was negative for any similar pathology.

  The patient was referred for systemic chemotherapy with a vincristine-etoposide-carboplatin protocol for six cycles. Examinations under anesthesia were performed in between the chemotherapy cycles every 6-8 weeks. In addition, cryotherapy was performed for more peripheral retinoblastoma tumors and posteriorly located malignant tumors were treated with laser photocoagulation.
