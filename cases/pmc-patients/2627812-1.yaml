original_case_description: |
  A 35-year-old Caucasian female school teacher initially presented with a one day history of left sided facial weakness. Two weeks earlier she was treated by her general practitioner with a course of oral amoxicillin for sore throat. There was no other significant past medical history and she was on no regular medications. The patient was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. An otolaryngological examination was unremarkable but for incomplete left lower motor neuron type of facial palsy (House & Brackman Grade III). A provisional diagnosis of Idiopathic Facial Paralysis (Bell's Palsy) was made and the patient was discharged home after reassurance and on no specific medications.

  Two days later she returned with paralysis now involving both sides of the face. While she did give a history of 'pins and needles' on both hands and feet, and stiff shoulders, she denied any numbness over the sites. She denied any history of trauma, rashes, travel abroad or exposure to tick bites. She was aware of altered taste sensation. Examination revealed bilateral complete lower motor neuron type of facial palsy (House & Brackman Grade VI). All other cranial nerves were intact and there was no evidence of sensory deficits elsewhere. Lower limb power was 4/5 across all muscle groups, while power in the upper limbs was normal. By the tenth day, she developed loss of ankle reflexes bilaterally. Paradoxically, at this time, the biceps, triceps and jaw reflexes were brisk. Plantar reflexes were flexor throughout. There was no bladder or bowel involvement at any point. Fundoscopy was normal.

  Blood tests for full blood counts, urea and electrolytes, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the vasculitic screen were within normal limits. Blood culture was negative. ESR was 20 mm/1st hr.
