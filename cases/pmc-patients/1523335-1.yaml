original_case_description: |
  The patient is a 60-year old man who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 1989 and had a family history of overweight and diabetes. Retinopathy was diagnosed in the mid-90s. The patient had been treated several times with focal laser photocoagulation. In 2003 he developed proliferative retinopathy and was treated with photocoagulation. In addition to glimepiride and the ACE-inhibitor quinapril, medication included metoprolol, furosemide, simvastatin and aspirin. In 1995–1997, his blood pressure (BP) was on average 125/90 mm Hg. Over the same period, the patient's bodyweight varied between 89 kg and 85 kg. Traditional dietary counselling for weight loss usually resulted in a short-term loss of a few kg, but the bodyweight soon increased again.

  In July 1997 albuminuria was noted with a urine concentration of 116 mg/l. That year the patient's average body mass index (BMI) was 29.4 kg/m2 and the average bodyweight was 87.0 kg.

  Insulin treatment was started four months later resulting in a temporary improvement of HbA1c but an increase in bodyweight. One year later, his BMI was 32.5 kg/m2 and his weight was 94 kg. The insulin dose was lowered in order to avoid further increase in bodyweight.
