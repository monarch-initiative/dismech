original_case_description: |
  A 32-year-old female developed symptoms about one and a half years prior to her visit,
  including amenorrhea after nursing, facial hair growth, acne, and back pain. She had
  previously been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome despite five successful
  pregnancies achieved without assistance. Physical examination revealed profound muscle
  weakness preventing her from lifting her child, facial plethora, abdominal fat
  redistribution, and a compression fracture of the lumbar spine. Laboratory testing
  revealed markedly elevated urinary-free cortisol levels (228-265 mcg/24h; normal <50).
  Inferior petrosal sinus sampling demonstrated the pituitary as the source of her
  hypercortisolism. Advanced pituitary imaging identified a 7 x 5 mm micro-adenoma on the
  left side. Cushing's disease was confirmed. Transsphenoidal surgical resection successfully
  achieved remission with normalized postoperative cortisol levels.

  A 32-year-old female developed amenorrhea, facial hair growth, acne, and back pain
  over 18 months. She had been previously diagnosed with PCOS. Physical examination
  revealed profound muscle weakness, facial plethora, abdominal fat redistribution,
  and a lumbar compression fracture. Laboratory testing revealed elevated urinary-free
  cortisol. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling localized the source to the pituitary.
  Imaging identified a 7 x 5 mm micro-adenoma. [DIAGNOSIS] was confirmed, and
  transsphenoidal surgery achieved remission.
