    notes: "Metastatic bone cancer considered with lytic skull lesions; M-spike on SPEP and clonal plasma cells established plasma cell myeloma diagnosis"

original_case_description: |
  A 71-year-old male presented with a four-month history of fatigue and recurrent upper
  respiratory infections. His spouse observed cognitive decline, and he experienced bone
  discomfort in the skull and neck regions without prior trauma. He demonstrated a 15-pound
  weight loss over 12 months. Physical examination revealed tenderness in neck and skull
  areas upon palpation with intact neurological function. Laboratory findings included
  normocytic anemia, elevated creatinine, and hypercalcemia. Blood smear showed rouleaux
  formation. Skull X-ray demonstrated multiple lytic bone lesions. Serum protein
  electrophoresis revealed an M-spike (IgG kappa). Bone marrow biopsy confirmed multiple
  myeloma with clonal plasma cells exceeding 10% of total marrow cells.
