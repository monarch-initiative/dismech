original_case_description: |
  P. is a 26-year-old female who is single, college graduate, and currently does not work. She lives with her mother and stepfather; her birth carried no complications, was breastfed up to 8 months of age, experienced her menarche at 12 years, began to be sexually active at the age of 16, and has normal psychomotor development.

  P. was diagnosed with HD in 2008 according to the Medical Genetics Laboratories detected through a blood sample. The father carrier of HD died of medical complications at 40 years and had three more siblings with HD.

  In May 2008, when the patient was 25 years old, a genetic test was conducted with a sample of blood. The result showed a mutation detected. Repeats Allele I: 58 and Allele II: 17.

  According to the DNA, one expanded allele of 58 repeats was detected and the other allele size was within the normal range for the laboratory. Thus, these results indicate that the individual has the common genetic alteration found in HD. Genetic counseling was recommended for at-risk family members.

  Analysis of the DNA from this individual has been used to study the size(s) of the CAG (trinucleotide repeat) repeat region of the Huntington gene. The normal range is considered to be up 28 copies of the repeat. Alleles with 27 repeats up to and including 35 repeats are considered to be normal mutable alleles. To date, symptoms of HD have not been reported in individuals with 35 or less repeats. Allele sizes of 36 up to and including 38 repeats are considered to be Huntington alleles with reduced penetrance. HD alleles (mutations) are 40 repeats and greater.

  From diagnosis until the present time, the patient did not use any medication for HD. At 25, P. began to present difficulties in dealing with new situations, such as performing daily tasks. Also, she displayed a lack of concentration, coordination, mood swings, and some involuntary movements. The patient sought treatment with complaints of depression and difficulty with attention and concentration.
