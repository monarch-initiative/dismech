original_case_description: |
  A middle-aged female presented with scleroderma renal crisis as the initial manifestation
  of systemic sclerosis. The characteristic presentation included new-onset malignant
  hypertension and progressive acute renal failure, with associated microangiopathic
  hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 20% of scleroderma renal crisis
  cases occur prior to establishing a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis, and in some cases
  there is no evidence of skin sclerosis at the time of presentation. Treatment was
  initiated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, the cornerstone of therapy for
  this life-threatening complication.
