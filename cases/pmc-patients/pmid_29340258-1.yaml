    label: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005336
      label: myopathy
    notes: "Initial presentation of painful muscle cramps could suggest primary muscle disease; combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs indicated ALS"
  - term:

      label: cervical radiculopathy
    notes: "Right upper shoulder and arm symptoms could mimic cervical spine disease; widespread motor neuron involvement ruled out focal etiology"

original_case_description: |
  A 51-year-old male presented with dull muscle cramps in the right upper shoulder and arm
  as the initial symptom. After careful history and physical examination, it was found that
  the patient had both upper and lower motor neuron signs. Upper motor neuron signs included
  spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and Babinski sign. Lower motor neuron signs encompassed
  atrophy, weakness, and muscle fasciculation. This combination of findings led to a diagnosis
  of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This case represents an atypical initial presentation and
  emphasizes that ALS should be considered when patients present with progressive painful
  muscle cramps.
