diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0013282
    label: alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0015264
      label: cryptogenic organizing pneumonia
    notes: "Initial presentation with organizing pneumonia pattern on imaging; AAT deficiency discovered on further workup explaining susceptibility"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005002
      label: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    notes: "COPD was considered given respiratory symptoms; genetic testing revealed underlying AAT deficiency as predisposing factor"

      id: MONDO:0015925
      label: interstitial lung disease
    notes: "Radiographic pattern initially suggested ILD; organizing pneumonia as specific subtype with AAT deficiency etiology"

original_case_description: |
  A 49-year-old female presented with progressive dyspnea and cough. Chest imaging revealed
  bilateral patchy consolidations consistent with organizing pneumonia. The patient had no
  significant smoking history but had recurrent respiratory infections. Pulmonary function
  tests showed mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern. Serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels
  were markedly reduced. Genetic testing confirmed homozygous PiZZ phenotype. The organizing
  pneumonia was treated with corticosteroids, and augmentation therapy was initiated for
  the underlying alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
