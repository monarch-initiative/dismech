diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0008233
    label: pheochromocytoma

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0003924
      label: adrenal cortex adenoma
    notes: "Imaging showed homogeneous lesion 31mm in diameter that initially suggested benign adenoma; elevated catecholamine metabolites confirmed pheochromocytoma"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0001106
      label: anxiety disorder
    notes: "History of anxiety with palpitations could suggest primary anxiety; paroxysmal nature and laboratory findings indicated catecholamine excess"

original_case_description: |
  A 70-year-old female with a history of anxiety, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and
  palpitations presented with recurrent abdominal pain along with tremor and weakness in
  the lower limbs. On examination, the patient had pale skin with no palpable masses or
  cardiac/abdominal murmurs. Laboratory workup revealed elevated catecholamine metabolites
  with urinary metanephrines of 1080 ug/24h and urinary normetanephrine of 734 ug/24h.
  Imaging demonstrated a homogeneous lesion 31mm in diameter in the right adrenal gland.
  Following preoperative alpha-blockade with phenoxybenzamine, adrenalectomy was performed
  successfully. Postoperative urinary metabolite levels normalized and blood pressure
  monitoring at three months showed normal readings.

  A 70-year-old female with hypertension, anxiety, and palpitations presented with recurrent
  abdominal pain, tremor, and lower limb weakness. Laboratory workup revealed elevated urinary
  metanephrines and normetanephrine. Imaging showed a 31mm lesion in the right adrenal gland.
  [DIAGNOSIS] was confirmed. Following preoperative alpha-blockade, adrenalectomy was performed
  successfully with normalization of catecholamine levels and blood pressure.
