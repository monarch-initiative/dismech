title: High carriage rate of high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in a Taiwan kindergarten
  associated with a case of pneumococcal meningitis
age:
- - 5.0
  - year
gender: M
pub_date: '2005'
diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0006913
    label: pneumococcal meningitis

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0007015
      label: viral meningitis
    notes: "CSF findings and gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in pairs distinguished bacterial from viral; culture confirmed S. pneumoniae"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0018059
      label: meningococcal meningitis
    notes: "Other common bacterial meningitis in children; gram stain morphology (cocci in pairs vs diplococci) and culture identified pneumococcus"

original_case_description: A 5-year-old boy with a two-day history of fever, vomiting and poor intake
  was brought to the emergency room of Veterans General Hospital-Kaohsiung, Taiwan in April 2002. He had
  cough for 2 days before the onset of fever and had visited a pediatric clinic, where oral antibiotics
  were prescribed. No otitis media or sinusitis was noted upon admission. He also had no prior hospitalizations
  or any major systemic illness in the past. On admission, his vital signs consisted of a temperature
  of 38.6°C (ear), pulse rate 108/min, respiratory rate 60/min and blood pressure of 134/87 mmHg. The
  physical examination revealed a drowsy child with nuchal rigidity and a positive Kernig sign. The Glascow
  Coma Scale was E1V1 M6. Chest radiography was normal. A lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure
  of > 400 mmHg. The total white blood cell count of the CSF was 66/mm3, with 28% neutrophils, 68% lymphocytes,
  and 4% monocytes. The glucose and protein were 11 mg/dL and 596 mg/dL, respectively. Numerous gram-positive
  cocci in pairs were seen on microscopic examination. CSF and blood and nasopharyngeal cultures were
  positive for S. pneumoniae. The C-reactive protein was 12.3 mg/dL (normal <1 mg/dL). The immunoglobulin
  profile was within normal limits. The patient was intubated. Cefotaxime 200 mg/Kg/D and vancomycin 60
  mg/Kg/D were administered immediately after lumbar puncture was performed. Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/Kg/D
  was also administered prior to the parenteral antibiotics and continued for 4 days. The isolates obtained
  from blood, nasopharynx and CSF demonstrated an MIC to penicillin of 4 μg/mL. A follow-up lumbar puncture
  was performed 72 hours after admission. The CSF glucose was 52 mg/dL and protein was 292 mg/dL with
  a lowered opening pressure. Vancomycin and cefotaxime were administered for a total of 15 days. He became
  afebrile on the 7th day. He was gradually weaned from the ventilator and fully recovered without neurological
  sequelae.
