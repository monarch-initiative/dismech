original_case_description: |
  A 53 year-old Caucasian lady was admitted to the Medical Assessment Unit with a 4 day history of a spiking pyrexia, a dry macular erythematous rash and a new onset of confusion, generalised lethargy and difficulty sleeping.

  Her past medical history included childhood rheumatic fever, epilepsy (completely controlled on cambamazepine), and rheumatoid arthritis, for which, 2 months previously, she had commenced weekly subcutaneous etanercept (50 mg), having failed to respond well to methotrexate and hydroxychloroqine alone. She had suffered a number of flare-ups in the proceeding 12 months, requiring 3 intramuscular steroid injections for symptomatic control. On admission, she was also taking tramadol, ibuprofen and 5 mg of folic acid. She is a full time carer for her disabled husband, and smokes 4 cigarettes daily.

  Initial investigations revealed abnormal liver function (ALT 204 iu/L, ALP 393 iu/L), a urine dipstick positive for leucocytes and nitrites and a low white blood cell count of 3.9 × 109/L with raised inflammatory markers. She was afebrile and haemodynamically stable with a normal chest x-ray, and so was treated for a presumed urinary tract infection with trimethoprim. An abdominal ultrasound showed slight fatty hepatic infiltration, and urine cultures gave mixed growth.

  Over the next 3 days there was a general deterioration in her condition, becoming increasingly confused with a GCS of 12–13/15, and a pyrexia of up to 38.5°C. Despite conversion of her antibiotics to intravenous amoxicillin, her GCS fell to 10 and she became severely tachypnoeic and peripherally shut down. With an evolving sepsis apparent, she was fluid resuscitated and normal CT head permitted a lumbar puncture. She was transferred to the intensive care department for further management. The CSF analysis showed a raised white cell count of 130/μL (50% polymorphs), a glucose of 1.4 mmol/L and a protein of 1.02 g/L. This was highly suggestive of bacterial meningitis, despite no meningism clinically, so she was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir (to cover HSV encephalitis). Subsequent CSF culture revealed no growth, and PCR was negative for cryptococcus, meningococcus, listeria and common viral causes (HSV, VZV and enterovirus). Her confusion and clinical parameters improved and 3 days later she was transferred from ITU. Although slight confusion persisted for some days, she completed her course of IV antibiotics and was discharged home after a further 10 days.
