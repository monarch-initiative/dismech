original_case_description: |
  A sixty-eight year old male, known to have Childs B liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, presented to our service with persistent passage of bright red blood per rectum. Although hemodynamically normal, the bleeding was associated with a two gram drop in hemoglobin over a 72 hour period and continued despite attempts by medication to reduce his portal venous pressure (he was commenced on propanolol alone for the first 24 hours and then, as the bleeding continued, terlipressin) and correction of his coagulopathy (his INR on admission was 1.7 and so he was administered Vitamin K intravenously). A flexible sigmoidoscopy both confirmed the clinical suspicion of rectal varices and facilitated endoscopic banding of the culprit anomalies. Significant bleeding ceased immediately after this procedure allowing continued medical optimisation. He was discharged three days later on propanolol (titrated to achieve a resting pulse of 55 bpm), spironolactone and frusemide. Since then he has complied with his medical treatment and the rectal bleeding has not recurred within the first year of follow-up.
