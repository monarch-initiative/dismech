title: "An adult cystic fibrosis patient presenting with persistent dyspnea: case report"
age:
  value: 52
  unit: year
gender: M
pub_date: "2006"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0009061
    label: cystic fibrosis

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0004822
      label: bronchiectasis
    notes: "Non-CF bronchiectasis can present similarly; CF confirmed by sweat chloride and genetic testing (ΔF508, 2789+5G>A mutations)"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0016575
      label: primary ciliary dyskinesia
    notes: "Another genetic cause of bronchiectasis and sinusitis; CF distinguished by sweat chloride test and CFTR mutations"

original_case_description: |
  A 52-year-old white male with CF presented with persistent exertional dyspnea and cough with scant sputum production. Physical examination demonstrated oxygen saturation of 91%, with normal temperature and vital signs. His weight had fallen from 79.2 to 77.1 kg over 3 months. Cardiovascular exam was entirely normal. Lungs demonstrated coarse breath sounds bilaterally with scattered rales throughout the lung fields. The abdomen was normal, extremities demonstrated significant clubbing and there was no peripheral edema. Forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) had decreased from 50% to 36%. The chest radiograph resembled baseline findings with no obvious infiltrate or pneumothorax. He received a month-long course of azithromycin, aztreonam and inhaled tobramycin for suspected pulmonary exacerbation of acute super-infection in the setting of underlying chronic CF lung disease.

  One month later, follow-up revealed no improvement in dyspnea and no change in the scant sputum production, despite full adherence to the antibiotic regimen and airway clearance techniques. Exertional discomfort located along the sternum and left anterior chest associated with dyspnea without radiation or pressure sensation was further described but was not associated with palpitations, diaphoresis or nausea. This discomfort improved with rest and was not associated with meals. He did report the need to sleep upright in a recliner, but denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

  CF was diagnosed in this patient by sweat chloride at age 35 after an episode of hemoptysis, with subsequent genetic analysis identifying a ΔF508, 2789+5G>A mutation. He also has gastroesophageal reflux, Barrett's esophagus, azoospermia, and pancreatic insufficiency. He had sinus surgery at age 47.
