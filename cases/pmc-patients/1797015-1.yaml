original_case_description: |
  In August 2000, a 37 year old Native-American male received a cadaveric liver transplant after approximately 20 years of chronic HCV infection, genotype 1a. He was a former intravenous drug user (IVDU) and had been enrolled in a MMT program since 1990, taking between 80 and 100 mg methadone daily. He also had a history of anxiety and mood disorders, and had been taking clonazepam, 1 mg 4 times daily since 1999. At transplant evaluation, the patient had solid psychosocial support (family and counseling) and had a consistent ten year adherence to his MMT, including negative toxicological screens. The UCDMC transplant team determined that it would be in the patient's best interest to continue his MMT pre and post transplant.

  The patient had a MELD score of 15 at the time of transplant. He tolerated the operation well with no major complications during surgery, although he did require more intraoperative anesthesia than the average non-MMT patient. Post-operative pain management during hospitalization required consultation with pain specialists and the doses of hydromorphone and morphine were higher than the average non -MMT transplant patients. On post-operative day six, the patient resumed a normal diet; his pain was managed with oral narcotic analgesics; he was fully ambulatory and was discharged from the hospital. Immediately post-transplant, the patient's methadone was 100 mg daily.

  In June 2001, the patient showed biopsy proven recurrent HCV in the transplanted liver. There were no signs of rejection. The patient was continuing MMT ~80 mg daily and was compliant with his immunosuppressive therapy and transplant follow up care. In January 2002, the patient began HCV treatment using an escalating regimen of INF combined with RBV. He reached full dose INF (3 MIU three times per week) and RBV (1200 mg daily) at approximately 10 weeks of treatment. The intention was to treat for 48 weeks on combination therapy. The patient started treatment with a low viral load (410,760 IU/mL). At approximately six months of therapy, he was HCV-RNA quantitatively virus negative.

  Overall, the patient had common side effects to the combination therapy. His physical symptoms included fatigue, nausea, headaches, and flu-like symptoms. These side effects were treated symptomatically and either resolved or were well-tolerated. Although the patient was taking immunosuppressive drugs throughout his HCV therapy, his white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts remained stable. By treatment week 12, he did experience significant hemolytic anemia (Hgb 10.7 g/dL) and was started on 40,000 units per week of erythropoietin. The patient's RBV was reduced to 800 mg daily for two weeks and then was increased to 1000 mg daily for the remainder of treatment.

  Due to a history of anxiety and mood disorders, the patient was started on low dose antidepressants, citalopram 10 mg daily, three months prior to starting treatment. Additionally, the patient experienced psychiatric side effects to IFN/RBV including mood swings, angry outbursts, insomnia, and forgetfulness. In 2006, four years after treatment, he continues to be HCV free with annual liver biopsies showing no signs of disease or fibrosis, stable on immunosuppression, on minimal doses of methadone, and compliant with medical advice and medications.
