    notes: "MRI showed large pituitary tumor; elevated GH and IGF-1 with failed suppression confirmed GH-secreting adenoma causing acromegaly"

original_case_description: |
  A 19-year-old Caucasian woman of German nationality presented to our hospital in October 2006 with persistent visual disorders. A large pituitary tumor was diagnosed by MRI, but was deemed unsuitable for surgical resection due to its parasellar and suprasellar extension.

  Acromegaly was confirmed by standard endocrinological examinations. Her GH level was >40 ng/ml and was not suppressed by a standard oral glucose load. Her IGF-1 levels were 631 ng/ml. However, the only clinical sign of acromegaly was hyperhidrosis and there was no evidence of hypopituitarism.

  Our patient did not respond to the initial dose of lanreotide 60 mg, so the dose was increased to 120 mg every four weeks. Her IGF-1 levels decreased to within the normal range one month after this increase in dosage. She remained relatively stable for 17 months. After 10 months, the dose of lanreotide was increased to 180 mg every three weeks. Hyperhidrosis improved after the normalization of her IGF-1 levels. Her GH levels were substantially reduced after initiating the treatment, but they did not drop to the target of <2.5 ng/ml at any time during the 17 months of treatment.
