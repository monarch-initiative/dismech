title: "Percutaneous septal ablation for left mid-ventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a case report"
age:
  value: 34
  unit: year
gender: M
pub_date: "2006"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0005045
    label: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0042981
      label: aortic valve stenosis
    notes: "Can cause similar outflow obstruction and systolic murmur; echocardiography showed septal hypertrophy and SAM confirming HCM"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005021
      label: dilated cardiomyopathy
    notes: "Other major cardiomyopathy; distinguished by preserved/hyperdynamic LV function (EF 75%) and septal hypertrophy rather than dilation"

original_case_description: |
  A 34-year-old man with HC (primarily diagnosed 6 years ago) was referred to our clinic with the complaints of palpitation, chest pain and dyspnea on exertion, despite medication with 200 mg metoprolol daily. His functional capacity was New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III. He had no family history of HC. The fourth heart sound and moderate systolic murmur in mitral area radiating to mid-clavicular line were heard at cardiac auscultation. On electrocardiogram, sinus rhythm, left axis deviation and repolarization abnormalities (negative T waves) were seen. Chest X-ray showed neither cardiomegaly nor pulmonary congestion. Echocardiographic examination was done to assess the LV anatomy and revealed normal dimensions of the LV at end-diastole (41 mm) and end-systole (19 mm), SAM of the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation, left atrial dilatation (55 mm) and hypertrophic interventricular septum (mid:25 mm, basal:27 mm). LV ejection fraction was 75%. Continuous-wave Doppler measurements showed a peak systolic resting gradient of 46 mmHg, with an increase to 96 mmHg at Valsalva's maneuver at the LV outflow.
