original_case_description: |
  A three-year-old boy, of Nigerian parents, with Sickle Cell Anemia (Hb SS), with HbF 8–14%, and steady state Hb 6–7 g/dl, diagnosed at birth. The diagnosis of SCD was confirmed at 3 months of age, with Hb electrophoresis showing bands predominantly at S, F and absent A. He was admitted to the hospital at the age of 6 weeks, with severe anemia of unknown cause for which he received the first blood transfusion. He then presented for routine follow up at the age of three years and found to have massive lymph node enlargement. Nodes were noted in the deep cervical, posterior auricular and axillary chains. The largest measured 2 cm by 2 cm. Nodes were also present in both groins, measuring about 1.5 cm, and were mobile and soft. There was no evidence of ongoing systemic illness. Examination was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. An ultrasound at this time also confirmed the presence of lymph nodes at the hilum of the spleen and liver. No diagnosis was made and the nodes appeared to reduce in size and were presumed to be the result of a viral infection or sickle cell disease.

  Later in the same year, he was admitted with acute vaso-occlusive crisis. At this time, the lymph node enlargement was again noted. Further radiological investigation confirmed the multiple enlarged lymph nodes scattered throughout the abdomen. Other investigations, including a complete blood count, blood film, chest radiograph, virology screen, lymphocyte sub-sets, Heaf test (Screening for Tuberculosis) and HIV test, were all normal. The lymphadenopathy once again started to resolve spontaneously.

  At age five, he developed further recurrence of the lymphadenopathy. Examination, at this time revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in axillary, cervical and inguinal groups. The lymph nodes were attached to each other, with a 'grape-like' appearance and 'sponge-like' consistency on palpation. Because of the progressive lymph node enlargement, an open lymph node biopsy under anaesthesia was performed, which was reported as follows: There was hyperplasia of the paracortex with abundance of plasma cells. In addition, there were very large epitheliod histiocytes, which contained lymphoid cells within their cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry showed this plasma cell population to be polyclonal. The histiocytes stained with S100 protein typical of the diagnosis of RDD.

  Subsequently, his medical history has been complicated by repeated admissions for infections and vaso-occlusive crises and the need for chronic blood transfusion for three years. This in turn led to iron overload due to non-compliance with chelation therapy and so the blood transfusions were stopped. In addition shortly after the second presentation with massive lymphadenopathy, he developed overwhelming Streptococcus pneumoniae septicemia, requiring ventilation. This was further complicated by cardiac failure, secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy. He is no longer on blood transfusions, but continues on cardiac medication.

  At the age of seven, he again developed severe anemia with hemoglobin of 2.6 gm/dl, associated with Morganella morganii septic arthritis, from which he recovered after prolonged antibiotic treatment. The infectious complications are most probably related to the SCD. He also recently developed a hemolytic anemia with a positive Direct Coombs Test (DCT) and a reticulocyte count of 330 × 109/l. The auto-antibodies are not thought to be linked to the transfusion programme because whilst on the transfusion programme he had repeated negative DCT's, until 8 months after cessation of the transfusion programme. The degree of DCT has progressed from mildly to strongly positive, and there are now demonstrable anti-bodies e.g. IgG5 and IgGB.
