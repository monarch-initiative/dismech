title: "Bilateral renal angiomyolipoma in a patient with tuberous sclerosis treated with resection of one kidney and transarterial embolization of other kidney using CT during selective arteriography: a case report"
age:
  value: 28
  unit: year
gender: F
pub_date: "2009"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0001734
    label: tuberous sclerosis

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0004555
      label: kidney angiomyolipoma
    notes: "Sporadic AML can occur without TSC; bilateral involvement and childhood diagnosis confirmed syndromic association"

original_case_description: |
  The patient, a 28-year-old Japanese woman, had been under periodic follow-up since her childhood for tuberous sclerosis, and underwent right nephrectomy for AML at the age of 17; she continued to be under follow-up for immediate detection of AML developing in the remaining left kidney. During the course of follow-up, the patient developed sudden abdominal pain and needed emergency hospitalization because of decreased serum Hb level. Laboratory examination at admission revealed a serum Hb level of 7.3 g/dL and serum Cre of 0.9 mg/dL.

  Abdominal CT revealed a fairly large-sized tumorous lesion situated primarily in the left retroperitoneum and containing a huge aneurysm-like hemorrhage. The left renal artery was dilated to nearly the size of the aorta. While a part of the normal kidney parenchyma was identified, most of the remaining organ was occupied by the AML and constituents of the hematoma secondary to rupture, that conspicuously impinged on and displaced the abdominal viscera.

  An abdominal angiography revealed marked distension of the left renal artery, and it was difficult to visualize the mass clearly and to accurately delineate the vascular supplies to the normal kidney parenchyma, even by left renal arteriography (infusion rate, 7 mL/sec; total dose of the contrast medium, 35 mL). Based on these findings, we carried out embolization of the aneurysm-like bleeding site with metallic coils and of the rest of the bleeding sites with gelatin sponge particles.
