  term:
    id: MONDO:0011382
    label: sickle cell disease

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005279
      label: pulmonary embolism
    notes: "CT angiogram was performed to rule out acute pulmonary embolism given hypoxia and dyspnea; result was negative"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0001516
      label: acute colitis
    notes: "Abdominal symptoms and bowel wall thickening raised concern for acute colitis from other causes; clinical context favored vaso-occlusive etiology"

original_case_description: |
  A 34-year-old female with sickle cell disease presented with abdominal pain, nausea,
  vomiting, and dyspnea that proved unresponsive to her home pain regimen. Key findings
  included hypotension (70/44 mm Hg), tachycardia (104 beats/min), hypoxia (91% on
  supplemental oxygen), elevated lactic acid (14.5 mmol/L), severe anemia (hemoglobin
  6.4 g/dL), and severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.013). CT imaging revealed extensive
  small and large bowel thickening concerning for vaso-occlusive enterocolitis, a
  manifestation known as girdle syndrome. The patient developed gastrointestinal
  vaso-occlusive crisis with acute mesenteric ischemia and ultimately succumbed to
  multiorgan failure within 24 hours despite aggressive interventions including
  exchange transfusion and maximal vasopressor support.
