original_case_description: |
  A 41-year-old African-American man with a history of hypertension presented to a health clinic with a one month history of fevers, chills, mild dyspnea, generalized arthralgias, and a maculopapular rash, he was treated with levofloxacin and discharged. However, five days later the patient was admitted to the emergency department with a fever of over 40°C. During the course of three days the patient had episodes of marked dyspnea, with up to forty-four breaths per minute, as well as a blood pressure of 80/50, he was intubated, placed on pressors and transferred to our institution. Further workup revealed diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) with D-dimer > 5000 and multiorgan failure including fulminant hepatic failure (AST 12,300 U/L, ALT 4,900), acute renal failure (BUN 52 and creatinine of 5.2), and cardio-respiratory failure. Electrocardiograms demonstrated atrial fibrillation with right bundle branch block and diffuse low voltage. A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and acute respiratory distress syndrome. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed demonstrating biventricular dilatation, global hypokinesis, and right and left ejection fractions of 20% and 17%, respectively.

  Serology for IgG toxoplasmosis Ab, cytomegalovirus IgM and serum DNA PCR for Parvovirus was positive. Serology was negative for human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein Barr virus, West Nile virus, viral hepatitis, Streptococcus, Influenza, Rickettsia, Coxackie, Legionella, and Adenovirus.
