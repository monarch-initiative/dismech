    notes: "Common febrile illness in Sudan; malaria confirmed by positive blood smear and P. falciparum-specific rapid diagnostic test"

original_case_description: |
  Patient 1 was a 27 year old Swiss female working in Sudan for an international NGO. She was not taking antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. She developed a febrile illness that was diagnosed locally as malaria by positive microscopic examination (species and parasitaemia unknown) and Paracheck, a rapid diagnostic test that detects P. falciparum-specific histidine-rich II protein. By inference, she was infected with P. falciparum either alone or mixed with another Plasmodium species. She self-prescribed oral artemether, obtaining the drug from the NGOs pharmacy. She did not recall the dose of artemether, but she reported full compliance with the five days course contained in the package. She improved on this treatment, but four days after stopping artemether, she developed fever again and had a positive malaria blood smear (species and parasitaemia unknown) consistent with a recrudescence of her primary infection. She was retreated with the same five days regimen with good effect. Some three and a half weeks later, she suffered a recurrence of fever associated with a positive malaria smear (species and parasitaemia unknown) suggesting either a recrudescence of her initial infection or a new infection. PCR genotyping was unavailable to differentiate her recurrent illness. She received artemether for seven days in combination with a single dose (three tablets) of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and had no further episodes of malaria while in Sudan.
