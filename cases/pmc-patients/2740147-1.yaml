original_case_description: |
  A 45-year-old white male building contractor presents to a family practice clinic with symptoms of dysuria and pain on micturation. He has used cranberry tablets, with some relief. He has had this problem on and off for 20 years. He was recently treated him with doxycycline, which failed to help. He has no history of sexually transmitted diseases.

  The patient's history is significant for Addison's disease. He was diagnosed at age 19 when he presented to a hospital with extreme weakness. He was placed on maintenance doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. The patient reports childhood illness that included difficulty running and a year of quarantine due to an unidentified infection. The patient complains of unsteadiness while walking and is concerned he might have adrenoleukodystrophy. He had previously requested a serum B12 test, which was normal. He feels short of breath at times and has lower back pain. The patient is also concerned about symptoms of irritability and depression.

  His medication list includes hydrocortisone 20 mg daily, fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily, escitalopram 10 mg daily, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 50 mg daily, ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily.

  Both of the patient's parents are living. The patient's mother has coronary artery disease and Type II Diabetes. The patient is one of 10 siblings, 8 living, including one set of triplets and one set of twins. The patient is a fraternal twin. One of the brothers died unexpectedly two weeks after birth, another brother died at age 45.
