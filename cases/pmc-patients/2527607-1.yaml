title: "Paraneoplastic pemphigus regression after thymoma resection"
age:
  value: 42
  unit: year
gender: F
pub_date: "2008"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0018974
    label: paraneoplastic pemphigus

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0008219
      label: pemphigus vulgaris
    notes: "Initial clinical and histological diagnosis was pemphigus vulgaris; refractory course led to discovery of thymoma confirming paraneoplastic etiology"

original_case_description: |
  A 42-year-old otherwise healthy woman was admitted to our hospital with numerous crusted, denuded and flaccid vesiculobullous lesions over her chest, abdomen, legs, toes and forehead. Vesicles were also observed on the buccal mucosa and palate. The clinical diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris was confirmed by biopsy. Histological findings included interface dermatitis, apoptotic keratinocytes and focal areas of suprabasal acantholysis. Therapeutic management consisted of successive cycles of 50 mg/day of prednisone. Medical treatment provided only transient relief of symptoms and temporary reduction in clinical manifestations and on interruption of systemic steroid the lesions recurred.

  Three months later while facing a persistent pemphigus, a chest x-ray was done and a retrosternal tumor was noted. CT scans and MRI of the chest revealed a homogeneous anterior mediastinal mass consistent with a thymic tumor but with no lymph node involvement. In order to perform preoperative staging of the tumor, the patient underwent CT scans of brain, abdomen and a bone scan. All were normal. An autoimmune laboratory profile proved that desmoglein-1 (anti-DSG-1) antibodies were normal while the desmoglein-3 (anti-DSG-3) titer reached twice the normal.

  At operation through a median sternotomy, a solid intrathymic capsulated mass was found and a thymectomy was performed. Definitive pathologic examination found a tumor measuring 6 × 5 × 5 cm.
