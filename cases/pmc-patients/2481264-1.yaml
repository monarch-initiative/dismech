original_case_description: |
  A 77-year-old man presented with rectal bleeding in December 1998 due to carcinoma of the ascending colon and subsequently underwent right hemicolectomy, The tumour was staged as Dukes B. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given at that time. In August 1999 he developed disease recurrence in the liver and was treated with 12 cycles of oxaliplatin and a modified de Gramont regimen of 5-fluorouracil (OxMdg) with a good response. In October 2000 he underwent left hepatic trisectionectomy, involving resection of hepatic segments 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8, and liver remnant metastasectomies of segments 1, 6 and 7, along with revision of the right hemicolectomy due to local recurrence. There was no evidence of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis in the hepatectomy specimen. His liver enzymes and synthetic function returned to normal after this.

  He developed further extensive nodal recurrence both supra- and infra-diaphragmatically in November 2004 and was rechallenged with OxMdg. Bevacizumab at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg (675 mg) was added to the regimen from the seventh cycle onwards and was given every 4 weeks. Protracted neutropenia and thrombocytopenia led to discontinuation of oxaliplatin after the ninth cycle. His liver function tests at the time of discontinuing oxaliplatin were bilirubin 17 μmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 134 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase 87 IU/l and albumin 30 g/l. 5-fluorouracil was stopped after cycle 11 due to a computed tomography (CT) scan in July 2005 showing a complete response.

  Maintenance bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg every 4 weeks) was continued as a single agent. In September 2005 he developed right hypochondrial pain and liver function tests showed raised bilirubin 26 μmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 217 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase 99 IU/l and albumin 30 g/l along with persistent thrombocytopenia (<100 × 109/l). He was not on any other medications which would significantly alter the liver function tests. CT scan showed oesophageal varices, new ascites and splenomegaly. The ascitic fluid was transudate with no evidence of malignant cells. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed oesophageal varices, a Barrett's oesophagus and portal gastropathy. These findings were all consistent with an intrahepatic cause of portal hypertension. Liver biopsy showed Kupffer cell hyperplasia and pericellular fibrosis with a predominantly centrilobular distribution, but no definite occluded vessels were seen. There was no evidence of cirrhosis. These features were considered to be consistent with SOSVOD.

  Subsequently, bevacizumab was stopped in October 2005 and a policy of watchful waiting was adopted. The patient recovered from the acute damage to his liver and subsequently the ascites resolved and liver function tests normalized. As of September 2007 the patient remains in complete remission but with persistent thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and gastroesophageal junction varices.
