title: "Extrapontine myelinolysis presenting as acute parkinsonism"
age:
  value: 41
  unit: year
gender: F
pub_date: "2006"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0002562
    label: demyelinating disease

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005180
      label: Parkinson disease
    notes: "Presented with acute parkinsonism (rigidity, tremor, cogwheel); distinguished by acute onset after hyponatremia correction and MRI basal ganglia changes"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0100480
      label: autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency
    notes: "Low cortisol noted; hyponatremia and hyperkalemia consistent with adrenal insufficiency which contributed to the electrolyte abnormality"

original_case_description: |
  A 41-year-old caucasian woman presented with ataxia, tremor, dysarthria, and cogwheel rigidity. Two weeks prior to admission she had been on a holiday in southwest Africa. After three days in the hot climate there, she developed tiredness and fatigue with profuse vomiting. In hospital, routine bloods showed low sodium less than 100 mmol/l and raised potassium at 5.9 mmol/l. Other routine blood parameters were normal and random cortisol was low at 136 nmol/l.

  Using intravenous normal saline, she was started on gradual sodium replacement aiming at 8 mmol/l correction per day with daily electrolyte monitoring. The sodium improved to 130 mmol/l over 5 days. Over the next week she developed dysarthria and ataxia with rigidity and tremor. MRI showed faint symmetrical change laterally in the basal ganglia that were not felt to be significant.

  With a deteriorating condition and no clear diagnosis, she was flown back to the UK as an emergency for assessment at our tertiary neurological centre.

  She had been diagnosed with coeliac disease at the age of 14 and maintained close dietary control. Two months prior to her holiday, she was found to have hypothyroidism and had been started on thyroxine 25 mcg once a day. There was no other past medical or surgical history.

  On examination she was slim and under-nourished with a noticeable tan. She was afebrile and pulse and blood pressure were normal. Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examinations were normal. Glasgow coma scale was 14/15.
