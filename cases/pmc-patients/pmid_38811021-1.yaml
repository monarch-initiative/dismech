  term:
    id: MONDO:0010200
    label: Wilson disease

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0016264
      label: autoimmune hepatitis
    notes: "Hepatic presentation of Wilson disease can histologically resemble autoimmune hepatitis; ceruloplasmin and urinary copper testing help differentiate"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0003441
      label: dystonic disorder
    notes: "Neurologic Wilson disease presents with movement disorders that may be mistaken for primary dystonia; Kayser-Fleischer rings and copper studies confirm Wilson disease"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005155
      label: cirrhosis of liver
    notes: "Hepatic form may present as chronic liver disease; young age and basal ganglia involvement on imaging should prompt Wilson disease testing"

original_case_description: |
  An 18-year-old male presented with combined hepatic and neurologic manifestations of
  Wilson disease. The patient had elevated liver enzymes and evidence of chronic liver
  disease. Neurologic examination revealed dysarthria and movement abnormalities. Key
  diagnostic findings included Kayser-Fleischer rings on ophthalmologic examination,
  hypoceruloplasminemia (low serum ceruloplasmin), and elevated 24-hour urinary copper
  excretion. Brain MRI demonstrated characteristic basal ganglia abnormalities. Genetic
  testing confirmed ATP7B gene mutations consistent with autosomal recessive Wilson
  disease. The patient was started on copper chelation therapy.
