title: "FNAB cytology of extra-cranial metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme may resemble a lung primary: A diagnostic pitfall"
age:

  unit: year
gender: M
pub_date: "2005"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0018177
    label: glioblastoma

  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005138

    notes: "Explicitly considered as primary lung cancer given smoking history and lung mass on imaging; extracranial GBM metastasis is rare"

original_case_description: |
  A 62-year-old male presented with shortness of breath for one week. He had a smoking history of 10 pack-years [1 pack per day, per year, for 10 years]. The X-ray chest revealed a large pleural effusion with suggestion of a mass in the right upper lobe of lung (RUL) with massive hilar lymphadenopathy. The left lung parenchyma was normal and the pulmonary vasculature was not congested. A computerized tomography scan of the chest confirmed a mass in RUL.

  Clinically, the tumor was considered as lung primary and pulmonary consult was requested. Bronchoscopy of RUL revealed an irregular friable mucosa. A transbronchial FNAB of the RUL mass was performed with other evaluations.

  The patient had previous history of GBM in the right occipital area 13 months ago for which he underwent initial surgical excision with radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy. The tumor recurred after 6 months for which he underwent extensive debulking and placement of gliadel wafers (BNCU-impregnated wafers).
