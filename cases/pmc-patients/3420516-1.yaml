title: "Atypical Parkinsonism Revealing a Late Onset, Rigid and Akinetic Form of Huntington's Disease"
age:
  value: 70
  unit: year
gender: M

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0007739
    label: Huntington disease

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005180
      label: Parkinson disease
    notes: "Akinetic-rigid presentation with bradykinesia, rigidity, and gait freezing mimicked PD; family history of chorea and genetic testing confirmed HD"
  - term:

    notes: "Atypical parkinsonism with postural instability; HD distinguished by family history and CAG repeat expansion"

original_case_description: |
  A 70 year-old man was admitted to our department in November 2005 with rising anxiety and severe gait difficulty. He had experienced depression first at 50 years of age, and beginning at 54 years of age, he developed a progressive walking difficulty characterized by bradykinesia, gait freezing, and loss of balance.

  He had no history of encephalitis or toxin exposure, and he had never been treated with neuroleptics or other antidopaminergic drugs. Familiar anamnesis evaluation disclosed that his brother, who died at 66 years of age, suffered from a choreic disorder, whereas his father, who had developed walking difficulties, died at the age of 80. The family history was otherwise negative.

  The patient was evaluated with the unified Huntington disease rating scale (UHDRS part I score = 50) and the unified Parkinson disease rating scale (UPDRS motor score = 27) by a neurologist with expertise in HD. He had moderate hypomimia, slurred and slow speech, and symmetric rigidity with "cog-wheeling" at the four limbs. We also observed dystonic posturing of his right hand. No rest or postural tremor was present. Choreic movements of the face and tongue were rarely observed, and his UHDRS chorea subscore was 2. The patient tended to adopt a slightly stooped posture, and his postural reflexes were severely impaired. His walking showed festination, propulsion, and bilateral reduction in arm swing. Cognitive functions were moderately impaired (UHDRS part II = 107.8). Beck depression score was elevated.
