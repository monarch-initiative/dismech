  unit: year

pub_date: "2011"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0005130
    label: celiac disease

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0001517
      label: dysentery
    notes: "In tropical countries like India, acute flaccid paresis and diarrhea are usually attributed to infectious etiologies; celiac crisis was eventually diagnosed"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0006915
      label: polyradiculoneuropathy
    notes: "Acute flaccid quadriparesis could mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome; severe hypokalemia as the cause pointed to metabolic etiology"

original_case_description: |
  An 8-year-old girl with previously undiagnosed celiac disease presented with flaccid
  quadriparesis secondary to severe hypokalemia associated with celiac crisis. The case
  involved multiple metabolic derangements and shock characteristic of celiac crisis.
  Diagnosis was expedited by an elevated anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody titer.
  The patient improved with correction of hypokalemia, corticosteroids and gluten-free diet.
  This case highlights that celiac crisis, though rare and life-threatening, should be
  included in differential diagnoses for acute paralysis and gastrointestinal symptoms.
