original_case_description: |
  Ms YS, an 18-year-old tribal girl from a rural upper middle-class joint family with no history suggestive of psychiatric and metabolic disorders, had consulted many physicians and went to several psychiatric centres for 3 years since 1994. Her longitudinal history revealed that after attaining menarche at the age of 13 she used to have dysmenorrhoea, which subsided spontaneously. In 1994, at the age of 15 years, she was investigated for pain abdomen, and antitubercular treatment was started although there was no evidence of tuberculosis. The same treatment was continued by a physician on referral to Dibrugarh. She did not show any improvement; instead her condition deteriorated after discharge from hospital, because of which her medicines were discontinued. She however recovered spontaneously but continued to have episodes of pain abdomen, which made her very restless.

  In March 1995, she was referred to a psychiatrist for vague somatic complaints. A diagnosis of conversion disorder was made. The patient never came for subsequent follow up, but on 26 December 1995 she reported with a history of poor sleep, crying spells, tingling of limbs, poor concentration and constipation. She was hospitalized and diagnosed as having 'adjustment disorder with depressed mood'. Since her condition did not improve, she was taken to a private psychiatric nursing home at Guwahati on 24 February 1996, where EEG and CT scan of the brain were done and chlorpromazine and dothiapin was given at discharge.
