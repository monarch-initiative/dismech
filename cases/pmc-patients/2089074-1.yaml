original_case_description: |
  A 72 year old lady, with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), was seen in the outpatient department with a six month history of progressive shortness of breath. Over this time she had suffered four exacerbations, requiring steroids and antibiotics, but no hospital admission. Previously her symptoms had been controlled with inhaled steroids, bronchodilators and as required home nebulisers. She also reported several episodes of streaky haemoptysis but there was no history of weight loss.

  Two years previously she had suffered a myocardial infarction resulting in mildly impaired left ventricular function; there was no history of any HSV infection. She was an ex-smoker with a 50 pack year history. Medication included Tiotropium 18 micrograms od, Seretide 250 ii bd and Brycanyl inhalers, as required Salbutamol nebulisers, Monteleukast 10 mg od, Valsartan 80 mg od, Clopidogrel 75 mg od, Fluoxetine 20 mg od, Prednisolone 10 mg od and Ezetimibe 5 mg od.

  Examination revealed widespread expiratory wheezing, there was no evidence of oral HSV; the remaining examination was unremarkable. Chest radiograph and baseline blood tests were all normal; her spirometry had remained stable.
