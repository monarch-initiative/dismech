    id: MONDO:0019610
    label: Zollinger-Ellison syndrome

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0007540
      label: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1
    notes: "Evaluated for MEN1 association given gastrinoma; hormonal and radiologic investigations of parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, and adrenal were negative"

      label: peptic ulcer disease
    notes: "Initial presentation of recurrent duodenal ulcers; H. pylori ruled out by negative urease and breath tests; elevated gastrin levels confirmed gastrinoma"

original_case_description: 'A 41-year-old female NF1 patient was admitted for the evaluation of a 3-year
  history of recurrent epigastric soreness, heartburn, and diarrhea. Repeated endoscopic examinations
  revealed recurrent duodenal ulcers. The symptoms were relieved by proton-pump inhibitors, but recurred
  when the medication was withdrawn. She was previously diagnosed with NF1 based on clinical features
  and family history. Her first-degree relatives (i.e., brother, sister, and second son) were also affected
  by fully developed features of NF1. She had no cognitive dysfunction or learning disabilities, and showed
  normal intellectual development. A physical examination revealed several café-au-lait spots and multiple
  small nodules on the anterior chest and areolar area, and also multiple axillary freckles. A skin-nodule
  biopsy demonstrated characteristic neurofibromas.

  On admission, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers in the descending duodenum.
  The rapid urease test and urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori were both negative. The serum fasting
  gastrin level was >1,000 pg/mL and 837 pg/mL in two consecutive measurements. A secretin stimulation
  test was not performed due to the unavailability of secretin. As a diagnosis of gastrinoma was strongly
  suggested, radiologic evaluations were performed to locate the lesion. Abdominal computed tomography
  (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed a 3 × 2-cm, clearly defined, well-enhanced mass
  adjacent to the duodenal loop in the subhepatic space (Figure ). No metastatic lesions were observed
  in the liver or regional lymph nodes.

  The association with MEN1 status was evaluated by hormonal and radiologic investigations of the parathyroid,
  pituitary, pancreas, and adrenal gland, which proved to be negative. As a definitive treatment, an intraabdominal
  mass of about 2.5 × 2 cm with a thick fibrous capsular outer layer was surgically isolated and completely
  resected from the right lateral border of the descending duodenum. Gastrinoma was finally diagnosed
  by immunohistochemical staining (Figures , ). An incidental finding during the operation was numerous,
  small (<1.0 cm), whitish nodular masses on the serosal surface of the small bowel, many of which were
  enucleated. The pathologic diagnosis was gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with a low mitotic index
  as evidenced by C-kit positivity (Figures , ). The serum gastrin level decreased markedly to 99.1 pg/mL
  at 1 month after the operation, and to 53.2 pg/mL 3 months later. There were no symptomatic or radiologic
  recurrences during a 14-month follow up.'
