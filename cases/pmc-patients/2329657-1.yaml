original_case_description: |
  In November 2006 a 25-year-old Palestinian woman was admitted to our emergency care unit with symptoms of vertigo and fatigue. She was in overall reduced physical condition, her skin and mucous membranes were pale and she suffered from infantile cerebral paresis and mental retardation. Her vital parameters were stable and there were no signs of hemorrhagic shock. Physical examination was normal with the exception of a reduced body mass index of 15.26. There were no signs of macroscopic bleeding from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. The patient's mother reported no weight loss over the past few years and normal caloric intake and no gastrointestinal problems. There were no signs of acute or chronic inflammation.

  Laboratory tests at admission revealed a marked microcytic hypochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 4.6 g/dl (normal range 11.68–15.84 g/dl), MCV 58 fl (normal range 85–95 fl) and a severe thrombocytosis of 1703 × 10^3/μl (normal range 140–440 × 10^3/μl). Leukocyte count was slightly elevated at 11.45 × 10^3/μl (normal range 3.8–9.8 × 10^3/μl) and differential blood count was regular. However, in her blood smear there was anisocytosis and reduced fraction of reticulocytes.
