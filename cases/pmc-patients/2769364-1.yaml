    notes: "Foot drop and muscle atrophy could suggest ALS; relapsing-remitting history and MRI findings confirmed MS"

original_case_description: |
  A 52-year-old white female physician with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) was referred to physical therapy for evaluation and treatment of low back pain and gluteus pain. She had been diagnosed with MS in 2000. In 2003 her disease was reclassified as SPMS, at which time she started using a cane and an ankle foot orthotic (AFO) for left foot drop. In 2004 she began using a scooter for fatigue. At presentation ambulation was limited to short distances (<20 yards). She sat semi-recumbent in a zero gravity chair for meals and desk work because of back fatigue. Stumbles and near falls were more likely to occur late in the day. Her MS medications included B complex vitamins, carnitine, lipoic acid, gabapentin, bupropion, baclofen, modafanil, mycophenolate, tolterodine, and minocycline. Bilateral glutei pain was reported. Low back pain (LBP) was centrally located and gradually progressed into the mid-thoracic region by evening. Pain was rated at 5 out of 10 for both.

  PT notes indicated the presence of atrophy of her left lower extremity and glutei muscles. Her gait with a cane but without the AFO demonstrated a left foot slap during stance phase.
