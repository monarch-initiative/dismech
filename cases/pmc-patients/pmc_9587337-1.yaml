diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0005011
    label: Crohn disease

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0001678
      label: intestinal tuberculosis
    notes: "Granulomatous inflammation in cecum could suggest intestinal TB; non-caseating granulomas and clinical course favored Crohn disease"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005062
      label: lymphoma
    notes: "Intraluminal mass and lymphadenopathy raised concern for lymphoma; lymph node biopsy was negative for malignancy"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005101
      label: ulcerative colitis
    notes: "Inflammatory bowel disease differential; transmural inflammation and skip lesions consistent with Crohn disease rather than UC"

original_case_description: |
  A 25-year-old male with no significant past medical history initially presented with severe
  diffuse abdominal pain rated 7/10, colicky in nature, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and
  loss of appetite. One month later, he returned with right iliac fossa pain, continued
  gastrointestinal distress, weight loss, and constipation lasting two days. Physical
  examination revealed tenderness on deep palpation without rebound or guarding. Lab work
  showed mild leukocytosis and slightly elevated ESR. Fecal calprotectin was markedly elevated
  at >1000 ug/g. Surgery revealed a hard intraluminal mass, an atypical finding for Crohn
  disease. Histopathology confirmed acute and chronic transmural inflammation at the cecum
  with focal mucosal ulceration and rare non-caseating granulomas, consistent with Crohn
  disease.
