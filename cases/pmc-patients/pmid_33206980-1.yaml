    notes: "Inflammatory arthritis with synovial effusion could suggest RA; presence of psoriatic skin lesions and sacroiliitis pattern favored PsA"

    notes: "Sacroiliitis and peripheral arthritis could suggest other spondyloarthropathies; cutaneous psoriasis confirmed psoriatic arthritis"

original_case_description: |
  A patient developed psoriatic arthritis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical
  manifestations included left knee arthritis with MRI showing synovial effusion in
  the left knee subquadricipital recess. The patient also had suspected cutaneous
  psoriasis on the lumbar region, macroscopic inflammatory lesions of the cecum and
  rectum, and MRI evidence of sacroiliitis. This case represents the emergence of
  psoriatic arthritis triggered by COVID-19 infection, demonstrating the potential
  for viral infections to precipitate autoimmune musculoskeletal disease in
  susceptible individuals.

  A patient developed inflammatory arthritis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical
  manifestations included left knee arthritis with MRI showing synovial effusion.
  The patient had cutaneous lesions on the lumbar region, inflammatory lesions of
