title: "Type I Gaucher disease with exophthalmos and pulmonary arteriovenous malformation"
age:
  value: 34
  unit: year
gender: F
pub_date: "2005"

diagnosis:

    id: MONDO:0018150
    label: Gaucher disease

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005364
      label: Graves disease
    notes: "Exophthalmos prompted thyroid workup; thyroid function tests (T3, T4, TSH, free T4) all normal, ruling out Graves ophthalmopathy"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0001982

    notes: "Other lysosomal storage disease with hepatosplenomegaly; distinguished by enzyme assay showing β-glucocerebrosidase deficiency"

original_case_description: |
  This 34-year-old woman was a case of Gaucher disease type I with initial presentation of hepatosplenomegaly and severe bone diseases including fractures of the lower extremities and bone crisis at childhood. She was the second of a pair of twins. Her twin sister and another younger sister are both affected. There is no consanguinity in the family. She underwent splenectomy at age 5 years due to persistent thrombocytopenia, but the diagnosis of Gaucher disease was established only after a bone marrow examination at age 11 years. Her leukocytes β-glucocerebrosidase activity checked at age 26 years was 1.56 nmol/mg/h (normal: >28.42 nmol/mg/h). At that time, she had severe bone deformities, hepatomegaly, anemia, clubbing fingers and toes, but pink lips. There was no audible heart murmur, and her breathing sound was clear. Her liver size was measured 5 cm below subcostal margin at right mid-clavicular line, and neither spider angiomata nor superficial vein engorgement was found. Hemogram revealed a platelet count of 103 × 10^9/L and hemoglobin level of 9.6 mg/dL. DNA analysis of this patient and her two affected siblings all revealed a V375L/L444P genotype of the β-glucocerebrosidase gene.

  The patient complained of bilateral orbital pain with gradual protrusion of eyes since 30 years old. Thyroid function tests, including T3, T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone and free T4, showed normal results. Ophthalmologic examinations failed to reveal any specific findings related to the exophthalmos. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyes revealed increases in retrobulbar space with fat-like density and mild hypertrophy of extra-ocular muscles. She received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) at a dose of 60 U/kg every two weeks since 32 years old.
