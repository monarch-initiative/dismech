original_case_description: |
  The 54 year old Caucasian woman, who came to our clinic for the first time in September 2006, complained of pain, loss of function and weakness in her right shoulder. She had suffered from these symptoms for years. Conservative treatment by analgesics and physiotherapy showed little or no benefit. Her main reason for coming to our hospital was an increasing loss of function of her right shoulder. In addition she reported several unexplained falls but no feeling of waddling gait and hypotonia. She had osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures at thoracic level 5 and 6. The corresponding thoracic gibbus was compensated by hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine. After a traffic accident in 2004, she was treated conservatively for a fracture of the right scapula and the sternum. She sometimes felt dysaesthesia in both hands. She casually referred to progressive muscle atrophy in both shoulders and upper arms, which other doctors had assigned to previous trauma and inactivity. The familiar anamnesis of her two sons was negative, without signs of neurological or systemic diseases. There was no intellectual impairment or facial weakness.

  The patient's clinical examination showed no signs of cardiac or pulmonary impairment. There was a frozen right shoulder, a pronounced isolated limb-muscle atrophy of the delta- und biceps-muscle on both sides and a rotator cuff tear of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle on the right side. There were no signs of muscle impairment in the hip or thigh. The clinical neurological examination revealed a normal result. Walking analysis showed no waddling gait.

  In view of the pronounced muscle atrophy of both shoulders, that was progressive over years, despite physiotherapy, a myopathy was suspected although it seemed unlikely in a middle-aged patient.

  Contrary to the expected high increase of the level of serum creatinkinasis, the level of serum creatinkinasis was only slightly above normal (186 U/l). The exact pattern of muscle atrophy was detected by a MRI of both shoulders which showed a fatty muscular atrophy of the delta- und biceps-muscle on both sides and a rotator cuff tear on the right.

  Despite the slightly increased serum creatinkinasis and the symmetric atrophy of identical muscles pointing to a muscular dystrophy of the limb girdle type, the diagnosis needed further examination using light microscopy and immunohistochemistry of affected muscles. Therefore we performed an incision biopsy of the right delta- and biceps-muscle to ensure diagnosis. The different samples were kept in formaline, in kryo-fixation, and before being embedded in plastic, in glutaraldehyde.

  The results of the immuno-histological analysis matched a chronical myopathy with related endo-, peri- and epimysial fibrosis. Trauma and inflammation were excluded as causes.

  Further analysis (western blot) revealed an abnormal and reduced laminin α2 chain and an abnormal reduced α-dystroglycan. These findings allow a diagnosis of LGMD2I, where a secondary reduction of laminin-a2 on immunolabelling was detected in most cases and a reduction in α-dystroglycan may also be seen.

  We discussed treatment options with the patient. Beside a conservative treatment with muscle training a cortisone therapy was recommended to prevent or slow down further progression. The patient refused a cortisone treatment due to the risk of adverse effects.
