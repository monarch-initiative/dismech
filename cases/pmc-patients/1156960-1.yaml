original_case_description: |
  A 44-year-old female presented with 2 months history of a progressive lump in right breast. She gave a past history of noncyclic mastalgia of two years duration. There was no other significant past history. Patient had undergone abdominal hysterectomy 4 years back for dysfunction uterine bleeding and was on hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone for the same duration.

  On examination there was 4 × 3 cm lump in upper outer quadrant of the right breast with no fixity to skin or underlying tissue. There were no significant axillary or supraclavicular nodes. Abdominal examination failed to show any organomegaly. Routine hematological, biochemical tests, chest roentgenogram, abdominal ultrasonogram and bone scans were normal. Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed Infiltrating duct carcinoma.

  Patient was planned for sentinel lymph node biopsy follow by mastectomy. 8 ml of Tc99 sulfur colloid was injected around the tumor and immunoscintigraphy images (anterior and lateral view) were taken. These images failed to show any lymph node uptake either in axilla or else where at the time of surgery 4 ml of isosulfan blue was injected peritumorilly and 20 minutes later axilla was entered. Sentinel node detection was also carried out using a hand held gamma probe (Navigator®, Auto sutures). Sentinel lymph node was identified by combined technique in level I axilla lying just posterior to the primary tumor. On gross examination most of the node appeared to be replaced by tumor and only a part of it appeared normal this part was stained blue while rest of the node was white. Histopathology of primary tumors was infiltrating duct carcinoma, with involvement of skin. Sentinel lymph node showed metastatic deposit. Other lymph nodes in axillary dissection specimen were also positive.
