title: "Juvenile Hemochromatosis with Novel HJV Mutations"
age:
  value: 34
  unit: year
gender: M
pub_date: "2024"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0019257
    label: hemochromatosis type 2

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005015
      label: diabetes mellitus
    notes: "Patient presented with diabetes; this could suggest primary diabetes but markedly elevated ferritin (4329 ug/L) and transferrin saturation (95.4%) indicated iron overload as underlying cause"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0002146
      label: hypogonadism
    notes: "Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was a presenting feature; could be mistaken for primary pituitary disorder but iron deposition pattern suggested hemochromatosis"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005155
      label: cirrhosis of liver
    notes: "Liver fibrosis present on imaging; primary liver disease considered but genetic testing confirmed HJV gene mutations as etiology"

original_case_description: |
  A 34-year-old Chinese male presented with multiple organ involvement including liver fibrosis,
  diabetes, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hypophysis hypothyroidism, and skin hyperpigmentation.
  Biochemical testing revealed markedly elevated serum ferritin level of 4329 ug/L and a transferrin
  saturation rate of 95.4%. CT scanning demonstrated hepatomegaly with high iron deposition.
  Targeted exome sequencing revealed a novel mutation c.863G>A (p.R288Q) in the HJV gene inherited
  from the father, and two known mutations in cis (c.18G>C p.Q6H and c.962_963delGCinsAA p.C321*)
  inherited from the mother. After 72 weeks of intensive phlebotomy therapy, the patient achieved
  reduction in serum ferritin to 160.5 ug/L.

  Biochemical testing revealed markedly elevated serum ferritin level of 4329 ug/L and a transferrin

  Targeted exome sequencing revealed mutations in the HJV gene consistent with [DIAGNOSIS]. After
  72 weeks of intensive phlebotomy therapy, the patient achieved reduction in serum ferritin to
  160.5 ug/L.
