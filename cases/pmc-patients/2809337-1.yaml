    id: MONDO:0004782
    label: diabetes insipidus

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0012105
      label: granulomatosis with polyangiitis
    notes: "Primary diagnosis causing the DI; cANCA positive with PR3 and multisystem involvement confirmed Wegener's"

    notes: "Pulmonary cavities raised concern for TB; mycobacterial infection was explicitly excluded"

original_case_description: |
  A 19-year old man presented in July 2000 with recurrent epistaxis, haemoptysis, nasal crusting, vasculitic skin rash, and bilateral episcleritis. On admission he was systemically unwell with a high ESR (113 mm/h) and CRP (61 mg/L). Full blood count and renal function were normal. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary cavities. Urinalysis was positive for blood and protein. Cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (cANCA) was positive with a PR3 titre of 73 (normal <6). Skin biopsy was in keeping with WG. Mycobacterial and fungal infection were excluded.

  He was started on intravenous pulses of cyclophosphamide alongside prednisolone (initially 40 mg per day) and co-trimoxazole. His disease rapidly responded. ESR fell to 15 mm/h, CRP to 22 mg/dL, and PR3 cANCA titre to 15. Urinalysis became negative, and chest x-ray showed complete resolution of pulmonary cavities. He continued to suffer low-grade nasal and sinus symptoms and, over the next four years, received methotrexate (up to 25 mg/week), infliximab (up to 5 mg/kg 6 weekly), and mycophenylate mofetil (1 g twice daily), interspersed with further courses of pulsed or oral cyclophosphamide and prednisolone.
