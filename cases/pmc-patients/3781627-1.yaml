original_case_description: |
  A 3-day-old full-term girl born to consanguineous (first-degree cousins) parents was admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit with jaundice and fever (37.6°C). Her birth weight was normal (3300 g) and had jaundice and poor feeding 1 day prior to admission. She was the offspring of the mother's second gravida. The first gravida was terminated via abortion. Prenatal history, mother's laboratory findings, and family history were unremarkable. The patient was delivered via Caesarian section and had normal APGAR scores.

  On physical examination she weighed 3000 g and her vital signs were stable. She had icterus, lethargy, and weak sucking. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count: 10.3 x 10^9/L; hemoglobin (Hb): 15.7 g/dL; red blood cell (RBC) count: 4.68 x 10^12/L; platelet (Plt) count: 233x10^9/L; C-reactive protein (CRP): 3.34 mg/dL; total bilirubin: 15.6 mg/dL: direct bilirubin: 1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 1367 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 504 U/L; prothrombin time (PT): >60 s; international normalized ratio (INR): >6; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): 88 s. The blood of the patient and her mother was O Rh +; Coombs test was negative. Serum sodium, potassium, and creatinine were 147 mEq/L, 4.5 mEq/L, and 0.46 mg/dL, respectively. Microbiological work-up, including blood culture, was performed and ampicillin-gentamicin was empirically started.
