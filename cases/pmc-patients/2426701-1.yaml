original_case_description: |
  We report the case of a 39-year-old man with a height of 178 cm and weight of 72 kg, working as a bellboy in a hotel. He had developed renal insufficiency 8 years previous, had undergone hemodialysis and had received a left renal transplantation after 2.5 years of hemodialysis. The patient had taken 8 mg methylprednisolone once a day for 3.5 years following the renal transplantation. The nephrologist following-up our patient decreased the methylprednisolone dose to 4 mg 1 week before admission.

  The patient had complained of increasing back and neck pain for 6 months prior to admission. He had been diagnosed with paravertebral spasm at two different locations. There was no history of trauma. After admission, the patient showed no improvement, and experienced worsening pain. The pain was an acute shooting pain resembling an electrical flash at the cervicodorsal site. Weight bearing was an occupational requirement, and the patient claimed that there was more pain while bearing heavy weights. There was also a history of night pains at the cervicodorsal site and pain and paresthesia of the upper extremity and chest.

  Neurological examination was normal. There was pain at the cervicodorsal site during neck movements, particularly during neck flexion. Based on the suspicious images of the spinous processes of the C7 and D1 vertebrae in the X-rays of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, cervicodorsal computerized tomography was performed. The spinous process fractures of the C7, D1 and D2 vertebrae were diagnosed as Clay-shoveler's fractures. The patient was treated with a cervical collar for 1.5 months. Due to the patient's history of renal transplantation and corticosteroid use, whole body bone densitometry was performed. The mean lumbar spine T-score was -2.7, and the mean femoral neck T-score was -2.1. The patient was given 10 mg oral alendronate once a day. At the second month of follow-up, the control dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) value of the mean lumbar spine T-score regressed to -2.6 and the mean femoral neck T-score regressed to -2.0, and at the fourth month, the scores had regressed to -2.4 and -1.9. Following the collar and alendronate treatment, the patient's pain regressed rapidly in 1.5 months. The patient was followed-up for 12 months, and he continued on oral methylprednisolone 4 mg/day during the follow-up.

  Alendronate treatment was discontinued when the patient's T-scores reached -2.0 (the mean lumbar spine T-score) and -1.3 (the mean femoral neck T-score) on the 12-month DEXA scan. For evaluation of the patient's renal function, urinary creatinine clearance was measured at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the alendronate treatment. No renal malfunction was observed. He was given a rest report that prohibited him from weight-bearing activities for a total of 6 months. Control computerized tomography scanning was performed 6 months after the resolution of the pain and the fracture sites were evaluated for union of the fractures. There was no pain at the follow-up examination 24 months after the fracture.
