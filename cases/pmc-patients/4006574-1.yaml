original_case_description: |
  An 11-year-old female presented to the emergency department after a week-long history of intermittent abdominal pain and was found to be tachycardic up to 190's. Six days prior to arrival she had her first episode of abdominal pain with emesis. She was at school and described the pain as vague and diffuse. The episode spontaneously resolved without intervention or medication, but she still complained of residual intermittent abdominal pain throughout the following week. Similar abdominal pain and nonbloody, nonbilious emesis brought her back to the school nurse on the day of ED visit. She had difficulty walking to the office due to dyspnea. The mother witnessed the patient having 2 episodes of seizure-like activity including clenching of the hands, stretching of the feet, and foaming at the mouth with lip cyanosis and incontinence lasting a total of 15 minutes.

  Upon arrival at the ED, the patient was severely tachycardic with an ECG demonstrating sinus tachycardia at 190 bpm with intraventricular conduction delay. The tachycardia improved to 130 bpm after fluid resuscitation with normal saline. The patient recalled experiencing similar palpitations in the past week that worsened with activity and improved with rest. Patient and mother report never experiencing fainting or having a murmur and deny ever having a seizure, neurological deficit, or gait disturbance in the past.

  An abdominal exam revealed slight right-sided distention that was tender with a palpable mass. Normoactive bowel sounds were present. Ear, nose and throat, respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, lymphatic, skin, and gross neurologic exams after the postictal stage were all normal.

  Abnormal lab results included elevated creatinine at 0.95 mg/dL, high lactate level of 7.94 mmol/L, and metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation as indicated by a pH of 7.27 with reduced HCO3− of 16.8 mmol/L and PCO2 of 38.2 mmHg. She also had anemia with a hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL.

  An echocardiogram was performed due to the persistent tachycardia and showed the presence of a large echogenic, mobile polypoid, and pedunculated mass in the right atrium with attachment to the wall close to the IVC entry point that measures 6.8 × 2.8 cm during prolapse through the tricuspid valve. In addition to tumor thrombus detected within the right atrium, thrombi were also detected in both right and left pulmonary arteries by CT. The V/Q scan of the lungs revealed decreased perfusion involving the majority of the left lower lobe. Because of this finding and the seizure activity, a head CT and MR angiogram were performed and showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. Stroke workup was unremarkable. A preliminary ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a large right renal mass with almost no normal renal parenchyma left. This finding prompted a CT scan. The CT of the abdomen showed a 13.2 × 10.6 × 16.5 cm intrarenal tumor of the right kidney, with possible rupture due to ill-defined margins anteriorly and medially. The tumor extended to the right renal hilus with invasion of the IVC. During inpatient admission, an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the right renal mass was performed, the result of which confirmed the diagnosis of Stage IV Wilms tumor with extension to the inferior vena cava, right heart, and lungs.

  The patient underwent Heparin anticoagulation. Per protocol for Stage IV Wilms tumor, chemotherapy was initiated with Dactinomycin IV 2.3 mg once, and Vincristine IV 2 mg every seven days. After three rounds of chemotherapy, the patient responded positively to treatment with resolution of pulmonary metastatic disease. The primary right renal mass slightly decreased in size from 12.1 × 10.5 cm in axial dimensions to 10.3 × 8.5 cm. The patient then underwent a median sternotomy, with IVC and right atrial thrombus removal, and pulmonary endarterectomy in addition to a radical right nephrectomy on cardiopulmonary bypass.

  She was monitored by video electroencephalography (EEG) throughout her hospitalization with no repeat seizure-like activity. No antiseizure medications had been given. Post-op, the patient developed a first-degree AV block that resolved within a week of surgery. On post-op day number 9, she is discharged to go home with prn Tylenol and oxycodone for pain management. Six months after her ED visit, she has had no repeat seizure-like activities or palpitations. The patient continued treatment with whole-abdominal radiation and chemotherapy.
