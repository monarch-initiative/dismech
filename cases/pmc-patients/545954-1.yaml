original_case_description: |
  A 29-year-old woman was admitted our hospital on August 1999, had been diagnosed as mucinous tumor of borderline malignancy a year ago. She was followed up at a local clinic. On the follow-up study, the patient's CEA level was raised to 43.32 U/L and CT scan showed splenomegaly with cystic lesion. Her past medical history was not significant. She already underwent two surgeries. The first surgery, right salpingo-oophorectomy, was performed at the age of 22 after being diagnosed as dermoid cyst. She was healthy thereafter. Seven years later, left ovarian mass was found on the routine check. At the second surgery, left ovarian mass excision, mucinous tumor of borderline malignancy was diagnosed.

  During follow-up after the second surgery, she was referred to our hospital on the suspicion of carcinomatosis peritonei. On the preoperative evaluation, splenic lesion, which had been existed for 2 years, was merely noticed as simple cystic lesion unrelated to the ovarian mass.

  To exclude peritoneal carcinomatosis, open laparotomy was perfomed. On opening the abdomen, no abnormal gross findings were found except the splenic lesion, which reported as probable metastatic adenocarcinoma on frozen sections. After splenectomy was carried out, peritoneal washings and multiple biopsies on the omentum, peritoneum, mesentery, and left ovary were performed to rule out possible microscopic peritoneal dissemination. Suspecting the transabdominal metastasis, 100 mg of cisplatin was infused into the peritoneal cavity at the end of the operation; however no intraperitoneal recurrence was confirmed after tissue diagnosis.

  Final pathologic examination showed metastatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Peritoneal washings and multiple biopsies were all negative. The patient was recovered from the surgery without the evidence of sepsis of severe thrombocytosis. The patient received 5 courses of Taxol and Carboplatin as postoperative chemotherapy.

  Two years after the surgery, 3 × 3-sized mass on the left ovary, which assumed to be recurrence, was detected. She has been followed up at outpatient department receiving symptomatic treatment and chemotherapy.
