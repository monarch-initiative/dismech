title: "An unusual pathological finding of chronic lymphocitic leukemia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate after transurethral resection for complete urinary retention: case report"
age:
  value: 79
  unit: year
gender: M
pub_date: "2004"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0004948
    label: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0010811
      label: benign prostatic hyperplasia
    notes: "Presenting symptom was urinary retention; TURP for presumed BPH incidentally revealed CLL infiltration"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0008315
      label: prostate cancer
    notes: "Low-grade adenocarcinoma also found incidentally on TURP; CLL was primary hematologic diagnosis"

original_case_description: |
  A 79-year-old white man, presented with acute urinary retention, was initially treated by indwelling catheter and was referred for complete urological evaluation. The digital rectal examination revealed a benign feeling prostate of 40 g, the physical examination was negative and the International Prostatic Symptoms Score (I-PSS) was 21. The transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) indicated an isoechonic and homogenic enlarged prostate of 42 cm3 and the abdomen ultrasound found a modest splenomegaly and no peripheral lymphadenophaty. The peripheral blood count showed an elevated lymphocytosis (21.250/mL) with a differential of 65.3% lymphocytes, while other parameters as platelet count, number of erythrocytes and lactate dehydrogenase hormone level were all normal. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 3.38 ng/mL with a percent free PSA of 8.28%. Due to his age and symptoms, the patient underwent transurethral resection of the prostate. The pathological examination of the tissue revealed an adenocarcinoma in the prostate with a Gleason Score 4 (2+2) of less than 5% of the material (clinical stage T1a), associated with a diffused infiltration of chronic lymphocitic leukemia elements, CD5 and CD20 positive. The patient underwent a computed tomography of the abdomen, confirming only a moderate splenic enlargement but not lymphadenomegaly (stage 2 of Rai) and was then referred for a haematological evaluation. No other investigations or treatments were required due to the age, the low grade and stage of the disease in this patient. At a follow-up of 24 months the patient is alive, with a PSA value of 0.65 ng/ml, a stable haematological condition and the International Prostatic Symptoms Score (I-PSS) is 6.
