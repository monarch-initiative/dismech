original_case_description: 'A 62-year-old retired woman was admitted to hospital via her GP for investigation
  of a four-week history of vomiting and malaise associated with hyponatraemia. She was initially diagnosed
  as suffering from viral gastroenteritis. However, the vomiting had persisted and had become associated
  with a mild frontal headache. She had an unremarkable past medical history and was not taking any regular
  medication. She had never smoked and there was no recent antecedent foreign travel.

  On examination she appeared clinically dehydrated but otherwise looked well, and was alert and orientated.
  She was apyrexial and had no rash, photophobia, neck stiffness or stigmata of endocarditis. She had
  a sinus tachycardia of 104/minute, with normal heart sounds, and a blood pressure of 130/76 mmHg. Chest,
  abdominal and neurological examinations were unremarkable. She had a plasma sodium of 127 mmol/L (135–145
  mmol/L), potassium of 3.4 mmol/L (3.5–5.0 mmol/l), urea 4.8 mmol/L (3.0–6.5 mmol/L) and creatinine of
  68 mmol/L (60–125 mmol/L). There was no biochemical evidence of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
  hormone (SIADH) production (serum osmolality 261 mmols/kg; urine osmolality 71 mmols/Kg; urine sodium
  < 10 mmol/L). Serum complement and plasma immunoglobulin levels were unremarkable with no evidence of
  immunosuppression. In addition, she had a normal full autoimmune profile and thyroid function. Random
  cortisol level was mildly elevated at 799 nmol/L (normal 140 – 700 nmol/L) consistent with a stress
  response.

  Her initial white cell count (WCC) was mildly elevated at 13.0 × 109/L (normal 4–11 × 109/L) with a
  neutrophilia of 10 × 109/L (normal 2–7.5 × 109/L). Her ECG and chest X-ray were normal. Her C-reactive
  protein (CRP) was slightly elevated at 10 mg/L (normal <5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
  was normal at 5 mm/hour. Her Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. Initial microbiological
  investigations (blood cultures, urine microscopy and culture) were normal.

  Initial management consisted of slow intravenous rehydration with normal saline and antiemetic therapy,
  which led to a mild symptomatic improvement. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed mild oesophagitis.

  During the ensuing two weeks her laboratory investigations remained stable (CRP normal; ESR normal;
  sodium 127–131 mmol/L; WCC 11–13 × 109/L). However, on day 4 of admission she developed a low-grade
  pyrexia of 37.5°C, which persisted (<38°C). A CT scan of the head revealed periventricular patchy white
  matter changes but no features of raised intracranial pressure or space occupying lesion.

  Unfortunately the patient had become slowly more lethargic, withdrawn, and depressed. By day 17 of admission,
  although alert, she was uncooperative with intermittent confusion. Her symptoms of intermittent nausea
  and vomiting with occasional frontal headache continued.

  On day 18 she underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) as she still had a low-grade pyrexia (temperature 37.5°C)
  and neutrophilia of 9.3 × 109/L). In addition, her nausea and vomiting had failed to fully settle with
  supportive treatment. The LP results were as follows: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appearance was pale
  yellow and clear; protein = 5.69 g/L (0.15–0.4 g/L); CSF glucose 1.7 mmol/L versus plasma glucose 5.7
  mmol/L (ratio = 30%, normal > 50%); CSF WCC = 106/mL (normal <5 WCC/mL) – 99% lymphocytes. Gram''s stain
  revealed gram-negative coccobacilli; acid-fast bacilli were not seen. She was commenced on intravenous
  ceftriaxone.

  Contrast MRI brain revealed sub-acute infarction of the right frontal cortex but with no evidence of
  meningeal enhancement. EEG demonstrated slow wave activity, which was consistent with a meningo-encephalitis.

  Within 48 hours of intravenous antibiotics she was more alert, orientated, and sitting out of bed. CSF
  culture grew gram-negative cocci, which was identified as Neisseria meningitidis group B, type NT, subtype
  NT P1.16/nt. She underwent contact tracing and completed a 10-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone.
  She continued to make a slow but progressive recovery. After a period of rehabilitation and intense
  physiotherapy she was discharged home 40 days after admission, with mild residual gait ataxia.'
