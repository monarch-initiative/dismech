title: "Unique type of isolated cardiac valvular amyloidosis"
age:
  value: 72
  unit: year
gender: M
pub_date: "2006"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0019065
    label: amyloidosis

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0042981
      label: aortic valve stenosis
    notes: "Bicuspid aortic valve with severe stenosis was present; amyloid lesion discovered attached to valve during surgery"

      label: infective endocarditis
    notes: "Lesion on aortic valve could suggest vegetation; amyloid confirmed by histopathology at excision"

original_case_description: |
  A 72 year old gentleman was admitted with shortness of breath and palpitations via accident & emergency department. He was found to be in atrial fibrillation and in left ventricular failure. He was a hypertensive diabetic with poorly controlled blood sugar. Examination revealed an ejection systolic murmur. His left ventricular failure was treated with diuretics. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a stenotic bicuspid aortic valve, with a valve area of 0.6 sq.cm. and a peak gradient at rest of 90 mm Hg. His pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 50 mm Hg. A lesion attached to the inferior surface of the leaflets and extending onto the basal septum was visualised.

  He was referred for urgent aortic valve replacement following stabilisation with diuretics. At operation, the lesion was found attached to the inferior surface of his bicuspid aortic valve. It abutted but was not attached to his ventricular septum. The valve and the lesion were excised intact and the valve replaced with a 23 mm mechanical prosthesis.

  The patient had a prolonged post-operative phase complicated by respiratory infection. However, he went on to make an excellent recovery and was discharged home.
