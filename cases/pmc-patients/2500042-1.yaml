original_case_description: |
  The patient is a 78 y.o. man with a six year history of progressive dementia beginning with forgetfulness, followed by progressive paucity of speech and associated language difficulties. Three years before he began speaking with predominantly one word answers to questions. In July 2005 he had a neuropsychological evaluation which demonstrated a variety of language difficulties, with paraphasic errors with word substitutions and mispronunciations. There were obvious impairments in attention, linguistic processing, and memory. He had dysnomia, oral fluency problems, and articulation difficulties. In September 2005, it was noted that he began using word substitutions, such as "hotto" for "honda", "tea" for "tie", and "burgle" for "verbal". There were no changes in mood, personality, or behavior, and no depression, hallucinations, or delusions. In April 2006, he was evaluated by a local neurologist and found to have severe aphasia. Work-up included an MRI, which showed global volume loss and minimal small vessel occlusive disease. CBC, RPR, B12, folate and TSH were normal. A diagnosis of possible primary progressive aphasia was made. Memantine was begun.

  A second opinion from another neurologist was obtained on April 25, 2006. His MMSE was 12/30. There was severe aphasia and word-finding difficulty and severely impaired comprehension, naming and word repetition. A diagnosis of semantic dementia, a language variant of frontotemporal dementia, was made. Memantine was increased to 10 mg twice a day, but caused constipation and was discontinued. In May 2006, donepezil was begun at 5 mg per day and increased to 10 mg daily the following month. By September 2006, the patient's memory difficulties had progressed such that he could not remember events from the same day. His speech was limited to only a few single words. Memantine was re-started. By February 2007, he was having difficulties performing the normal activities of daily living. He required assistance with showering, and on examination was almost mute. By May 2007, his comprehension of spoken commands had worsened, accompanied by marked apathy. Memantine was discontinued because of excessive daytime somnolence.

  On February 6, 2008, the patient was brought to our clinic for evaluation. He had been mostly mute for more than four months. There was no history of head trauma, tremor, or significant active medical illness. The patient's neurological examination was unremarkable except for the mental status exam. The patient had no spontaneous speech, did not verbally respond to most requests, and was unable to follow any but the simplest commands.
