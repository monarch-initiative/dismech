original_case_description: |
  In December 2006, a 55-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital because of palpitations. She had a history of cholecystectomy because of biliary stone, hysterectomy and hypothyroidism treated with thyroxine 50 μg/day. In a laboratory test performed in October 2006, serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dl and urine analysis was normal. Clinical examination showed hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, with normal ejection fraction. The atrial fibrillation resolved spontaneously, and treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor was started. In January 2007, a further episode of atrial fibrillation occurred. It resolved after intravenous propafenone, but serum laboratory tests showed an increase in creatinine (3 mg/dl) and potassium levels (5.8 mmol/l), and the ACE-inhibitor was stopped. Thyroid function was normal. Three weeks later, serum creatinine was found to have further increased up to 5 mg/dl, whereas both kidneys appeared normal on sonography (US) examination. The patient was admitted to our nephrology unit. On admission serum creatinine was 9.4 mg/dl.
