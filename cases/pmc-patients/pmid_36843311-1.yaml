    id: MONDO:0004691
    label: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease

  - term:
      id: MONDO:0002689

    notes: "Retroperitoneal hemorrhage and polycystic kidneys could raise concern for tumor bleeding; imaging confirmed cyst rupture as source"
  - term:

      label: aortic aneurysm
    notes: "Severe hemorrhage with altered mental status could suggest ruptured aortic aneurysm; angiography localized bleeding to lumbar artery from cyst rupture"

original_case_description: |
  A 60-year-old male with known autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease presented with
  altered mental status. Laboratory work revealed severe anemia with hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL.
  Abdominal imaging identified polycystic kidneys and a large left retroperitoneal hematoma.
  Angiographic studies demonstrated active bleeding from the left L3 lumbar artery. This
  represented a life-threatening retroperitoneal hemorrhage secondary to renal cyst rupture,
  occurring in the absence of major trauma or use of anticoagulants, highlighting the
  severity of uncontrolled cyst bleeding in advanced ADPKD.
