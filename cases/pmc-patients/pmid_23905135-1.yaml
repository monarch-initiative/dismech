original_case_description: |
  A 42-year-old male presented with progressive low back pain and stiffness of 15 years
  duration. The pain was worse in the morning and improved with activity. Physical examination
  revealed markedly reduced lumbar spine mobility with positive Schober test. Radiographs
  demonstrated bilateral sacroiliitis with syndesmophytes forming the classic bamboo spine
  appearance. The patient was HLA-B27 positive. Inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP
  were elevated. The patient had associated anterior uveitis requiring ophthalmologic
  management. Treatment was initiated with NSAIDs and subsequently TNF-alpha inhibitors
  with good clinical response.
