    notes: "Subsequently misdiagnosed as critical neuropathy/myopathy; unexplained bulbar symptoms should have prompted MG workup earlier"

original_case_description: |
  A 12-year-old male presented with recurrent respiratory pump failure and unexplained
  bulbar symptoms. The patient was initially mistaken for having meningitic sequelae
  and subsequently misdiagnosed as critical neuropathy/myopathy. This misdiagnosis
  led to considerable morbidity for nearly a decade. The correct diagnosis of myasthenia
  gravis was eventually established. Following correct diagnosis and appropriate
  management, the patient experienced significant improvement in his functional status.
  This case illustrates the importance of considering MG as one of the potential
  differential diagnoses in cases presenting with respiratory compromise or bulbar
  dysfunction.
