  - term:
      id: MONDO:0008223
      label: hypokalemic periodic paralysis
    notes: "Ascending weakness with severe hypokalemia could suggest primary periodic paralysis; elevated aldosterone with suppressed renin confirmed secondary cause"

    notes: "Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis considered given concomitant thyroid abnormalities; symptoms resolved after adrenalectomy without thyroid treatment"

original_case_description: |
  A 45-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of obesity and hypertension presented
  with a four-week history of myalgia and ascending muscle weakness eventually resulting
  in tetraparesis. Initial blood analysis showed severe hypokalemia (1.5 mmol/L),
  elevated plasma aldosterone with low renin activity, mild primary hyperthyroidism
  on thyroid function tests, and prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram. CT scan
  revealed a nodular lesion in the left adrenal gland. Primary hyperaldosteronism
  (Conn's syndrome) was confirmed by saline suppression test showing non-suppressed
  aldosterone and renin activity. Laparoscopic left adrenalectomy resulted in complete
  normalization of hypokalemia and regression of tetraparesis without requiring ongoing
  potassium supplementation.

masked_case_description: |
  A 45-year-old woman with hypertension presented with four weeks of myalgia and
  ascending weakness progressing to tetraparesis. Blood analysis showed severe
  hypokalemia (1.5 mmol/L), elevated plasma aldosterone with low renin activity.
  CT scan revealed a left adrenal nodule. [DIAGNOSIS] was confirmed by saline
  suppression test. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy resulted in complete resolution
  of symptoms.
