title: "Addison's Disease with Atypical Hypokalemia"
age:
  value: 42
  unit: year
gender: M
pub_date: "2021"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0000004
    label: adrenocortical insufficiency

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005015
      label: diabetes mellitus
    notes: "Severe hypoglycemia and loss of consciousness could suggest diabetic hypoglycemia; cortisol deficiency was the underlying cause"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0003019
      label: potassium deficiency disease
    notes: "Hypokalemia was present atypically; usually Addison's disease causes hyperkalemia - concurrent renal tubulopathy explained the low potassium"

original_case_description: |
  A 42-year-old male was admitted to the intensive care unit with loss of consciousness
  and severe hypoglycemia. Blood tests showed metabolic acidosis, critically low cortisol
  at 6 nmol/L (normal 68-327 nmol/L), and markedly elevated ACTH at 253 pmol/L (normal
  1.6-13.9 pmol/L). Unusually, serum potassium was low at 2.3 mmol/L (normal 3.5-5.1 mmol/L),
  requiring replacement therapy. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) was
  confirmed. Imaging revealed features suggestive of unilateral adrenal tuberculosis, and
  additional testing identified renal tubulopathy explaining the atypical hypokalemia. The
  patient responded favorably to cortisol replacement therapy.

  A 42-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with loss of consciousness and severe
  hypoglycemia. Blood tests showed metabolic acidosis, critically low cortisol, and markedly
  elevated ACTH. Atypically, serum potassium was low at 2.3 mmol/L, requiring replacement.
  [DIAGNOSIS] was confirmed. Imaging revealed features of unilateral adrenal tuberculosis,
  and renal tubulopathy explained the atypical hypokalemia.
