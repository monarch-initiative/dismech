    id: MONDO:0007739
    label: Huntington disease

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005180
      label: Parkinson disease
    notes: "Movement disorder with rigidity considered; presence of chorea and cognitive symptoms with earlier onset favored Huntington disease"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0004976
      label: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
    notes: "Progressive motor symptoms could suggest ALS; choreiform movements and cognitive decline inconsistent with ALS, genetic testing confirmed HD"

original_case_description: |
  A 39-year-old male presented with progressive neurological decline. Motor symptoms included
  chorea, muscle rigidity, coordination difficulties, and speech and swallowing impairments.
  Cognitive symptoms comprised impaired judgment, planning difficulties, slowed thinking, memory
  lapses, and attention problems. The diagnosis was confirmed by direct genetic testing using
  DNA obtained from a blood sample that revealed expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene.
  The patient's progressive deterioration resulted in wheelchair dependency and increased need
  for supportive care.
