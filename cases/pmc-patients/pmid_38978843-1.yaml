      id: MONDO:0005492

    notes: "Recurrent swelling episodes could suggest allergic urticaria; absence of urticaria or pruritus and positive family history pointed to HAE"

original_case_description: |
  A 2-year-old boy experienced recurrent episodes of hand and abdominal angioedema not
  associated with urticaria or pruritus. This presentation is unusually early, as young
  children with hereditary angioedema are typically asymptomatic, with affected individuals
  usually presenting in their early 20s. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic SERPING1 gene
  mutation identical to that found in his father, who carries a de novo mutation causing
  severe HAE. The mutation was identified at 9 months of age during genetic family counseling,
  preceding symptom onset. Clinical photographs documented hand involvement during attacks.
  Hereditary angioedema type I (caused by C1-INH deficiency) was confirmed.
