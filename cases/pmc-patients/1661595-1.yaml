original_case_description: |
  A 39-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with symptoms of headache, nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis. These problems had existed for 8 months. Otorhinolaryngologic examination revealed septal deviation and a hypertrophic left middle turbinate. Computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses revealed septal deviation and bilateral concha bullosa.

  The patient was placed under general anesthesia and underwent septoplasty and bilateral concha bullosa resection via lateral laminectomies. Histopathologic evaluation of the concha bullosa material from both the left and right sides revealed chronic inflammation and noncaseating granulomas. The granulomas were composed of epithelioid cells and a few Langerhans giant cells, and thus indicated various possible granulomatous diseases, including sarcoidosis.

  Consults were done in the departments of internal medicine, pulmonology and ophthalmology. Physical examinations, CT of the abdomen and chest, and pulmonary function tests were normal. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed; cytology of fluid was normal, and stain as well as culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolytes, liver and kidney function tests, serology for syphilis (VDRL), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were obtained in the patient, and all results were normal. Tuberculosis testing with purified protein derivative (PPD) revealed an induration of 13 mm, and the serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was 81.9 U/L. Based on all findings, the diagnosis was isolated sarcoidosis of the middle turbinates.

  Topical corticosteroid nasal spray was administered in the postoperative period. Throughout the 12 months after surgery, the patient remained free of symptoms.
