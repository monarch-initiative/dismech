original_case_description: |
  The patient was a 30-year-old Japanese woman. This was her first pregnancy. She had a pelvic neuroblastoma in the front of her sacrum at 1 month of age. She had undergone surgical resection, and the pathology revealed rosette-forming neuroblastoma. She received adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine and cyclophosphamide (the James method) postoperatively up to the age of 2 years. She also received pelvic irradiation with a total dose of 18 Gy. By age of 3 years, there was no evidence of disease, and she was considered cured.

  She visited out hospital for prenatal care at 6 weeks of gestation. At 15 weeks and 5 days of gestation, she complained of abdominal pain due to frequent uterine contractions and was diagnosed with threatened abortion or incompetent cervix by transvaginal ultrasound. She was admitted at 16 weeks of gestation and ritodrine tocolytic therapy was initiated to control her frequent uterine contractions. At 20 weeks and 2 days of gestation, she developed acute abdominal pain. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed intra-abdominal bleeding of unknown etiology. The patient and her husband chose to continue the pregnancy even after we explained to them the risks involved in doing so and after we suggested termination of pregnancy. She received 4 units of red blood cells but did not require any surgical intervention. At 23 weeks of gestation, she prematurely delivered a 510 g female infant due to sudden onset of labor pain. There were no signs of chorioamnionitis. The infant was admitted to the NICU and was discharged in good condition 110 days after birth.

  The patient presented with massive vaginal bleeding 14 days postpartum. Medical and surgical therapy was performed. Uterine curettage revealed a retained placenta. Despite these treatments, the patient experienced continuous slow vaginal bleeding. However, because her bleeding was light, she waited to see if the bleeding would stop naturally. An MRI was conducted at 46 days postpartum, and the scan revealed a placental polyp. Heavy vaginal bleeding occurred at 49 days postpartum. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) was considered, but the patient was noted to shed the placental polyp spontaneously with full recovery.
