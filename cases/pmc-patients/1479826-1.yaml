title: "Herpes encephalitis presenting as mild aphasia: Case report"
age:
  value: 59
  unit: year
gender: F
pub_date: "2006"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0012521
    label: herpes simplex encephalitis

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005098
      label: stroke disorder
    notes: "Progressive aphasia could suggest stroke; CT ruled out mass or bleed; temporal lobe changes on MRI favored encephalitis"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0006913
      label: pneumococcal meningitis
    notes: "Sphenoid sinusitis raised concern for bacterial infection; lack of fever and meningeal signs made bacterial etiology less likely"

original_case_description: |
  M.J. is a 59 year old woman who presented to the emergency room at a tertiary care center with a three day history of mental status changes. According to her accompanying spouse, three days prior she had eaten out and had one episode of diarrhea. Since then she had slowly become increasingly 'confused', as she described it. She had trouble finding the right words and had been using incorrect words in sentences. M.J. seemed untroubled by this change. These symptoms were accompanied by mild anorexia.

  M.J. had no significant previous medical history. She had no recent illnesses. She had experienced two vaginal births. The patient emigrated from Germany thirty years ago, and English was her second language. She resided in a medium-sized northern New England town with her husband. She operated a daycare out of her home, with approximately five pre-school aged children, none of whom had recently had any serious illnesses.

  On initial presentation to the Emergency Department, M.J. had no elevation in temperature. She had a mild frontal headache. Her vital signs were otherwise within normal limits. Her physical exam showed her to be alert and oriented, but with mild dysnomia on questioning. She did not have meningeal signs, but appeared mildly dehydrated. An initial computed tomography scan of the head (with and without contrast) was unremarkable for mass or bleed. However, it showed a moderate left-sided sphenoid sinusitis. Her leukocyte count, electrolytes, liver transaminases, folate, B12 and thyroid stimulating hormone were within normal limits.

  She was admitted with intravenous fluids and intravenous ceftriaxone as empiric antibiotic coverage. Throughout the next day, the patient became increasingly aphasic.
