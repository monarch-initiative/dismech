title: "Painful rib hump: a new clinical sign for detecting intraspinal rib displacement in scoliosis due to neurofibromatosis"
age:
  value: 13
  unit: year
gender: F
pub_date: "2006"

diagnosis:
  term:
    id: MONDO:0018975
    label: neurofibromatosis type 1

differential_diagnoses:
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0000726
      label: idiopathic scoliosis
    notes: "Most common cause of scoliosis; NF1 distinguished by cafe-au-lait spots and sharp angular kyphoscoliosis pattern"
  - term:
      id: MONDO:0005033
      label: ganglioneuroma
    notes: "MRI specifically ruled out neurogenic tumor as cause of cord compression; rib displacement confirmed as etiology"

original_case_description: |
  A 13-year-old girl was referred for evaluation of a progressive left thoracic kyphoscoliotic curve due to a type I NF. Clinical examination revealed multiple large thoracic and abdominal "cafe-au-lait" spots and the presence of a thoracic gibbous that was painful to pressure (Painful Rib Hump). Neurological examination revealed difficulty in gait, bilateral Babinski and ankle clonus, right drop foot, decreased superficial sensation, and increased tendon reflections in the lower limbs. Also the child complained of daytime uncontrolled micturitions. Plain radiographs showed a single, sharp, left thoracic kyphoscoliotic curve from T4 to T10 measuring 75° by the Cobb method with the apex at eighth thoracic vertebra. CT-scan revealed detachment and translocation of the cephalic end of the left eighth rib into the adjacent enlarged neural foramen. The costovertebral joint dislocation was at the apex of the curve on the convex side and the rib head was displaced into the spinal canal and compressed the spinal cord. The M.R.I. examination of the spine revealed the spinal cord compression by the displaced rib head and showed no other cord abnormality or neurogenic tumor.

  The patient underwent resection of the intraspinal mobile eighth rib head through a posterior approach and simultaneous correction and fusion of the kyphoscoliotic curve with posterior spinal instrumentation from T1 to L2. The Cobb angle postoperatively was 65°. The patient has neurological recovery.
