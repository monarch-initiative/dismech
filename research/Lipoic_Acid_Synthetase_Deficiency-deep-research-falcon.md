Disease Pathophysiology Research Report

Target Disease
- Disease Name: Lipoic Acid Synthetase (LIAS) Deficiency
- MONDO ID: not definitively established in retrieved evidence
- Category: Mendelian

Pathophysiology overview
LIAS deficiency is a mitochondrial disorder of protein lipoylation. LIAS (HGNC:6612) catalyzes the insertion of sulfur atoms into an octanoyl moiety (derived from mitochondrial fatty-acid synthesis, mtFAS) to produce protein-bound lipoate required by the E2 subunits of 2‑oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes—pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), 2‑oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH/α-KGDH), branched-chain α‑ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH)—and by the H protein (GCSH) of the glycine cleavage system (GCS). Loss of LIAS activity causes loss of lipoylation on these targets, resulting in impaired pyruvate oxidation (lactic acidosis), reduced TCA cycle flux (bioenergetic failure), and glycine accumulation (hyperglycinemia), typically presenting as neonatal‑onset encephalopathy with seizures. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.011 (Dec 2011) (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 1-2, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6). A 2022 synthesis of secondary mitochondrial diseases reiterates that LIAS loss and defects in lipoyl-transferases (LIPT1/LIPT2) converge on impaired lipoylation of PDH/OGDH/BCKDH and GCS with characteristic neurological phenotypes. URL: https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.220274 (Dec 2022) (baker2022mitochondrialbiologyand pages 10-11).

Recent developments (2023–2024)
- Ferredoxins and Fe–S dependency: Human mitochondrial ferredoxins FDX1 and FDX2 have distinct and overlapping specificities supporting mitochondrial iron–sulfur (Fe–S) chemistry; LIAS is an Fe–S protein whose activity depends on intact Fe–S biogenesis and ferredoxin electron transfer. The 2023 study by Schulz et al. provides functional/structural characterization of FDX1/FDX2 and experimental tools (antibodies to LIAS and lipoate; genetic constructs) used to interrogate lipoylation pathways, reinforcing that perturbation of ferredoxin/Fe–S systems can secondarily compromise protein lipoylation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01159-4 (Oct 2023) (schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 12-17, schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 17-19).
- Experimental therapeutics in related lipoylation disorders: In patient-derived LIPT1 mutant cells, a multi-agent “cocktail” (pantothenate, nicotinamide, vitamin E, thiamine, biotin, α‑lipoic acid) restored mitochondrial protein lipoylation, rescued PDH/OGDH activities, improved bioenergetics, and reduced iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, with evidence for SIRT3 involvement. Though centered on LIPT1, these findings illustrate tractable cellular endpoints and candidate pathways (NAD+/sirtuins, antioxidant defense) relevant across mitochondrial lipoylation deficiencies, including LIAS. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13081023 (Aug 2024) (gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 1-2, gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 29-30, gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 26-29).

1) Core Pathophysiology
- Primary mechanism: Failure of mitochondrial protein lipoylation due to deficient LIAS sulfur insertion into octanoyl substrates, leading to loss of lipoyl moieties on PDH E2 (DLAT/PDHX), OGDH E2 (DLST), BCKDH E2 (DBT), and GCSH. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.011 (Dec 2011) (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6); URL: https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.220274 (Dec 2022) (baker2022mitochondrialbiologyand pages 10-11).
- Dysregulated pathways: Pyruvate oxidation (PDH) and TCA cycle flux (OGDH) are markedly reduced; glycine degradation via the GCS is impaired, leading to hyperglycinemia. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.011 (Dec 2011) (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 1-2, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6); URL: https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.220274 (Dec 2022) (baker2022mitochondrialbiologyand pages 10-11).
- Cellular processes affected: Mitochondrial energy production declines, with secondary redox imbalance and oxidative stress; in experimental lipoylation deficiency models, intracellular iron accumulates and lipid peroxidation increases—plausible mechanisms in LIAS deficiency given shared endpoints of lost PDH/OGDH lipoylation. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13081023 (Aug 2024) (gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 26-29).
- Fe–S/ferredoxin linkage: LIAS harbors Fe–S cofactors; Fe–S biogenesis defects (e.g., NFU1/BOLA3) or impaired ferredoxin function (FDX1/FDX2) can secondarily reduce LIAS activity and mitochondrial lipoylation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.011 (Dec 2011) (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3); URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01159-4 (Oct 2023) (schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 12-17, schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 17-19).

- Chemical entities (CHEBI) implicated: lipoic acid (α‑lipoate), octanoyl‑ACP, thiamine pyrophosphate, NAD+, FAD; experimental cocktail agents that support redox/cofactor metabolism.

3) Biological Processes for GO annotation
- Protein lipoylation (GO:0031405): primary process lost in LIAS deficiency (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, baker2022mitochondrialbiologyand pages 10-11).
- Lipoic acid biosynthetic process (GO:0009108): depends on mtFAS intermediate octanoyl‑ACP and LIAS sulfur insertion (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 26-29).
- Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity (GO:0004738) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (GO:0006099): diminished due to loss of PDH/OGDH lipoylation (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6, gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 26-29).

- Iron–sulfur cluster assembly (GO:0016226): required for LIAS function; defects in NFU1/BOLA3, or loss of FDX1/FDX2 support, secondarily impair lipoylation (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3, schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 12-17, schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 17-19).

- Biochemical cascade: Loss of PDH/OGDH lipoylation leads to decreased PDH activity (pyruvate→acetyl‑CoA), TCA cycle stalling, increased lactate; loss of GCSH lipoylation causes hyperglycinemia (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 1-2, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6, baker2022mitochondrialbiologyand pages 10-11).
- Cellular dysfunction: Mitochondrial bioenergetic failure; in related lipoylation defects, iron accumulation, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and inability to sustain oxidative growth (galactose) are observed—likely convergent features with LIAS deficiency (gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 26-29).
- Clinical manifestation: Neonatal‑onset encephalopathy with seizures, hypotonia, acidosis; some cases with cardiomyopathy; rapid progression to severe neurodevelopmental impairment or early death (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6).

6) Phenotypic Manifestations and Mechanistic Links
- Lactic acidosis (HP:0003128): from impaired PDH activity; PDH activity can be profoundly decreased (e.g., 0.4 vs 6.1–19.8 nmol/min/mg in controls), with plasma lactate up to 57.7 mmol/L in a reported case. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.011 (Dec 2011) (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 1-2, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3).
- Hyperglycinemia (HP:0002154): due to non‑functional GCS; plasma glycine reported at 906 µmol/L in the index case. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.011 (Dec 2011) (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 1-2, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3).
- Neonatal-onset seizures and encephalopathy (HP:0001270; HP:0001298): reflect neuronal susceptibility to mitochondrial failure and glycine excitotoxicity (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6).
- Hypotonia (HP:0001252) and microcephaly (HP:0000252): consistent with severe early neurodevelopmental impact (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6).
- Cardiomyopathy (HP:0001638): reported in LIAS deficiency, plausibly via impaired α‑KGDH/TCA flux in the heart (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6).

Relevant statistics and data points from recent/landmark studies
- PDH complex activity: as low as 0.4 nmol/min/mg (ref. range 6.1–19.8) in LIAS-deficient tissue (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3).
- Plasma lactate: up to 57.7 mmol/L during crisis in the index LIAS case (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 1-2).
- Plasma glycine: 906 µmol/L in the LIAS index case (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 1-2).
- Cellular rescue metrics (LIPT1 model): restoration of mitochondrial protein lipoylation, recovery of PDH/OGDH activities, improved survival in galactose medium, reduction of iron overload and lipid peroxidation after 7‑day cocktail; SIRT3 dependency demonstrated pharmacologically (gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 26-29).

Key concepts and definitions
- LIAS: mitochondrial lipoic acid synthetase; an Fe–S enzyme that performs sulfur insertion on octanoyl-ACP–derived intermediates to generate protein-bound lipoate (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3).
- Protein lipoylation: covalent attachment of lipoate to specific lysines on E2 subunits of PDH/OGDH/BCKDH and on GCSH; essential for 2‑oxoacid oxidation and glycine catabolism (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, baker2022mitochondrialbiologyand pages 10-11).
- Ferredoxins (FDX1/FDX2): mitochondrial [2Fe–2S] proteins mediating electron transfer required for Fe–S biogenesis and monooxygenase reactions; functional specificity characterized in 2023; necessary to sustain Fe–S protein function including LIAS (schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 12-17, schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 17-19).
- Secondary lipoylation defects: defects in upstream lipoylation steps (LIPT1/LIPT2), mtFAS, or Fe–S assembly factors (NFU1/BOLA3) phenocopy LIAS loss by depriving PDH/OGDH/BCKDH and GCS of lipoyl cofactors (baker2022mitochondrialbiologyand pages 10-11) (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3).

Limitations and open questions
- Human LIAS-deficiency case numbers are limited; genotype–phenotype correlations and natural history require updated case aggregation.
- Translation of multi-target cellular rescue strategies to patients remains to be tested in LIAS deficiency; exogenous α‑lipoic acid is not incorporated into mitochondrial lipoylation in humans, highlighting the need for upstream pathway restoration (gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 26-29).

Conclusions
LIAS deficiency centrally disrupts mitochondrial protein lipoylation, crippling PDH/OGDH/BCKDH and GCS, and producing a characteristic neonatal metabolic encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and hyperglycinemia. Emerging 2023–2024 insights underscore the dependency of LIAS on Fe–S biogenesis and ferredoxin electron transfer, and suggest redox/cofactor-targeted approaches as promising cellular strategies for lipoylation disorders. Continued efforts should prioritize mechanistic biomarkers (lipoylation status, PDH/OGDH activity, iron/ROS metrics) and systematic clinical phenotyping to inform therapeutic development (mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 3-5, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 2-3, mayr2011lipoicacidsynthetase pages 5-6, baker2022mitochondrialbiologyand pages 10-11, schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 12-17, schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 17-19, gomezfernandez2024amultitargetpharmacological pages 26-29).
