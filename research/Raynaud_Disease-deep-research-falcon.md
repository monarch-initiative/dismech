- Category: Complex

Pathophysiology description
Raynaud disease is characterized by episodic, exaggerated vasoconstriction of the digital microvasculature triggered by cold or emotional stress, producing the classic triphasic color change (pallor → cyanosis → rubor) and ischemic pain. A contemporary model integrates dysregulated neurovascular control and endothelial dysfunction with humoral mediators and redox injury: cold/stress triggers α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in digital arterioles, which is amplified by microvascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) α2C‑adrenoceptor signaling and RhoA/ROCK pathways; concomitantly, impaired endothelial nitric oxide (NO)–soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)–cGMP signaling and increased endothelin‑1 (ET‑1) drive a persistent vasoconstrictive, pro‑proliferative state. Recurrent vasospasm provokes ischemia–reperfusion injury, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and endothelial damage. In secondary Raynaud associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc), defective angiogenesis, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), and microvascular rarefaction underlie progression to digital ulcers and tissue loss. “Primary” RP is largely functional (thermoregulatory arteriovenous anastomosis dysfunction), whereas “secondary” RP shows structural microangiopathy at nailfold capillaries that correlates with severity and complications. Management targets these mechanisms with calcium-channel blockers (first‑line), PDE5 inhibitors, prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists, focal botulinum toxin, and experimental ROCK inhibition.

- In SSc, “defective angiogenesis … usually precedes the onset of tissue fibrosis … [with] endothelial cells releasing higher levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and [showing] decreased nitric oxide,” promoting vasospasm and occlusive microangiopathy (Biomedicines; Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12061331). (romano2024recentinsightsinto pages 2-4)
- RhoA/ROCK signaling and α2C‑adrenoceptors are central to cold‑induced vasoconstriction in arteriolar VSMCs; ROS and stress kinases regulate α2C expression and translocation (Inflammopharmacology; Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-025-01792-0). (fardoun2025coldresponsesand pages 10-11)

1) Core Pathophysiology
- Primary mechanisms
  - Dysautonomia/adrenergic: Exaggerated sympathetic vasoconstriction in digital resistance vessels; cold‑triggered α2C‑adrenoceptor activation in VSMCs mediates local cooling–induced vasoconstriction and is potentiated by RhoA/ROCK and ROS signaling. (ture2024raynaud’sphenomenona pages 1-2, fardoun2025coldresponsesand pages 10-11)
  - Endothelial dysfunction: Reduced NO and prostacyclin with increased ET‑1 from activated/damaged endothelium; imbalance favors vasoconstriction, platelet activation, and intimal proliferation. (romano2024recentinsightsinto pages 2-4, patnaik2023endothelialdysfunctionin pages 7-8)
  - NO–sGC–cGMP impairment: Diminished eNOS (NOS3) bioactivity and sGC signaling reduce cGMP‑mediated VSMC relaxation, lowering vasodilatory reserve. (oztan2024determinationofmolecular pages 7-8, patnaik2023endothelialdysfunctionin pages 7-8)
  - Endothelin pathway: ET‑1 overproduction and altered ETA/ETB receptor signaling sustain vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling; endothelin antagonism improves SSc digital ulcer outcomes. (romano2024recentinsightsinto pages 2-4)
  - RhoA/ROCK: ROCK enhances VSMC contractility, α2C‑AR trafficking, and cold vasoconstriction; a target for pharmacologic inhibition. (ture2024raynaud’sphenomenona pages 1-2)
  - Oxidative stress/ischemia–reperfusion: Recurrent vasospasm causes ROS bursts and endothelial injury, exacerbating vasodilator deficits and promoting inflammation. (romano2024recentinsightsinto pages 2-4)
  - Impaired angiogenesis/EndoMT (secondary RP/SSc): EC apoptosis, EndoMT, senescence, and pro‑thrombotic activation drive capillary rarefaction and fibrosis. (romano2024recentinsightsinto pages 2-4)

3) Biological Processes (GO annotation perspective)
- Vasodilation/vasoconstriction regulation via NO–sGC–cGMP and endothelin pathways; smooth muscle contraction (RhoA/ROCK); cellular response to cold/adrenergic stimulus (α2C‑AR); response to oxidative stress/ischemia–reperfusion; angiogenesis and EndoMT; platelet activation/adhesion in injured microvessels.

4) Cellular Components
- Key locales include endothelial plasma membrane (eNOS/ET‑1), caveolae and cytoskeleton (α2C‑AR trafficking; ROCK targets), VSMC contractile apparatus, and extracellular space (ET‑1, CGRP, prostacyclin). sGC resides in cytosol; cGMP signaling interfaces with membrane ion channels and contractile machinery. (romano2024recentinsightsinto pages 2-4, fardoun2025coldresponsesand pages 10-11, patnaik2023endothelialdysfunctionin pages 7-8)

5) Disease Progression
- Sequence of events
  1) Trigger: cold or emotional stress activates sympathetic outflow and local cold sensors. 2) Vasospasm: α2C‑AR– and ROCK‑mediated constriction in digital VSMCs, potentiated by low NO/high ET‑1. 3) Ischemia–reperfusion injury: recurrent attacks generate ROS and endothelial injury. 4) Endothelial dysfunction/maladaptation: reduced NO/PGI2, increased ET‑1; in SSc, EC apoptosis, EndoMT, capillary loss and pro‑thrombotic changes. 5) Clinical complications: sustained microangiopathy leads to digital ulcers and tissue loss, especially in SSc. (ture2024raynaud’sphenomenona pages 1-2, romano2024recentinsightsinto pages 2-4, patnaik2023endothelialdysfunctionin pages 7-8)

6) Phenotypic Manifestations (HPO mapping)
- Triphasic color change, ischemic pain/paresthesias, cold intolerance; in severe/secondary disease, digital ischemia and ulcers. Nailfold capillaroscopy abnormalities correlate with severity and systemic complications in SSc. (ture2024raynaud’sphenomenona pages 1-2, romano2024recentinsightsinto pages 2-4)

7) Biomarkers and recent data
- Endothelial injury/activation markers: increased von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombomodulin; alterations in coagulation/fibrinolysis pathway components reported in RP datasets. (Turk J Biochem; 2024; https://doi.org/10.1515/tjb-2023-0197). (oztan2024determinationofmolecular pages 7-8)

Expert opinions and analysis
Recent authoritative reviews emphasize that Raynaud’s is not a single‑pathway disorder; effective care combines lifestyle/thermal strategies with mechanism‑directed pharmacology. Endothelial dysfunction is prominent in secondary RP and predicts complications; thus, therapies that restore NO bioavailability or block ET‑1 are particularly relevant in SSc‑associated disease, whereas targeting α‑adrenergic/ROCK pathways addresses cold‑triggered vasospasm in primary RP. Persistent ischemia–reperfusion and microvascular injury explain why ulcer prevention in SSc requires more than simple vasodilation and may benefit from endothelin blockade and prostacyclin therapy.

Relevant statistics and study data (selected 2023–2024)

Limitations
Some mechanistic facets, such as specific risk loci from recent GWAS and the magnitude of effect of individual variants, require direct citation of those primary genetics papers; the above integrates 2023–2024 reviews and mechanistic syntheses with selective 2025 updates where they clarify pathways relevant to 2023–2024 practice.
