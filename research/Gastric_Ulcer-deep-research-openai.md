### Core Pathophysiology  
Gastric ulcers are focal defects in the stomach’s mucosal lining that penetrate through the muscularis mucosa (usually >5 mm in diameter) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=category%20of%20peptic%20ulcer%20disease,155)). Fundamentally, ulcer formation results from an imbalance between aggressive factors and the stomach’s protective mechanisms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=PUD%20arises%20from%20an%20imbalance,18%20%2C%2019)). Key aggressive factors include **gastric acid** (hydrochloric acid) and **pepsin** (a proteolytic enzyme), as well as external insults like **Helicobacter pylori** infection or **NSAID** (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) use ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=PUD%20arises%20from%20an%20imbalance,18%20%2C%2019)). Protective factors – the mucus–bicarbonate barrier, adequate mucosal blood flow, prostaglandin-mediated cytoprotection, and prompt epithelial restitution – normally shield the stomach lining ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=Protective%20mechanisms%2C%20including%20mucus%20and,1)). When protection is compromised or aggression is amplified, the corrosive acid and enzymes digest the mucosa, leading to an ulcerative lesion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=are%20weakened%2C%20the%20gastric%20tissue,18%20%2C%2019)).

**H. pylori** infection underlies the majority of gastric ulcers by inducing chronic gastric inflammation (chronic active gastritis) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=The%20pathophysiology%20of%20gastric%20ulcer,focus%20on%20each%20in%20detail)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=H,153)). This spiral bacterium’s helical shape and flagella allow it to penetrate the gastric mucus layer and reach the epithelial surface ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=H,21)). H. pylori produces *urease*, an enzyme that converts urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, locally raising pH to buffer gastric acid ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=After%20encountering%20the%20gastric%20environment%2C,25%2C15)). The ammonia also reduces mucus viscosity and directly damages epithelial cells, correlating with enhanced apoptosis of gastric epithelium (especially in concert with H. pylori’s VacA cytotoxin) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=After%20encountering%20the%20gastric%20environment%2C,25%2C15)). H. pylori adheres to gastric epithelial cells via adhesins and delivers virulence factors like **CagA** (cytotoxin-associated gene A product) into host cells, disrupting cellular signaling and cell junctions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=VacA%3A%20Another%20important%20virulence%20factor,increased%20risk%20of%20GC%20or)). *“A common bacterial virulence factor is the production of CagA, which leads to more cytokine-mediated cell destruction and mucosal damage”* ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=production%20capabilities%20preventing%20ulcer%20genesis,3)). The bacterium also triggers a host immune response: gastric epithelial cells and immune cells recognize H. pylori via Toll-like receptors (e.g. TLR4 for LPS, TLR5 for flagellin) and other pattern recognition receptors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=receptors%20%28TLRs%29%20detect%20pathogen,antimicrobial%20peptides%2C%20type%20I%20interferons)). This activates signaling pathways (NF-κB, AP-1, etc.), driving the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like **IL-8** (CXCL8) that recruit neutrophils ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=receptors%20%28TLRs%29%20detect%20pathogen,antimicrobial%20peptides%2C%20type%20I%20interferons)). Neutrophils and macrophages infiltrate the mucosa, releasing reactive oxygen species and proteases that contribute to tissue injury. Paradoxically, H. pylori is adept at evading immune clearance – for instance, its *VacA* toxin inserts into host cell membranes forming pores and can interfere with antigen presentation (by impairing MHC-II trafficking) and T-cell activation (inhibiting IL-2 production via the NFAT pathway) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L196%20autophagy,38)). The result is a smoldering chronic inflammation that may persist for decades ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=virulence,invasive%20methods%2C%20and)). Chronic gastritis thins the protective mucus layer and damages the epithelial tight junctions, making the stomach lining more vulnerable to acid. 

Importantly, H. pylori-induced gastritis alters gastric physiology in ways that promote ulceration. If the infection predominantly involves the gastric antrum (distal stomach), the inflammation suppresses **somatostatin** production by antral D-cells, which normally inhibits gastrin release ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=gastric%20mucosa,159)). The loss of somatostatin brake leads to hypersecretion of **gastrin** from G-cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=gastric%20mucosa,159)). Elevated gastrin levels stimulate the gastric parietal cells (directly and via histamine release from enterochromaffin-like cells) to increase acid output, creating a hyperacidic environment ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=gastric%20mucosa,159)). This scenario – antral-predominant H. pylori gastritis with resultant high acid – is strongly linked to peptic ulcer development, especially duodenal ulcers ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Knowing%20H,such%20as%20somatostatin%2C%20stimulating%20gastrin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=gastric%20mucosa,159)). In some patients, H. pylori infection is more diffuse (pangastritis), which can lead to gland loss and reduced acid secretion; those patients may still develop **gastric ulcers** due to direct mucosal damage from inflammation, even if acid levels are normal or low ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=the%20host%20that%20leads%20to,common%20bacterial%20virulence%20factor%20is)). Overall, H. pylori’s presence is a major driver of ulcer pathogenesis: it is estimated to be involved in ~80% of gastric ulcers ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=The%20pathophysiology%20of%20gastric%20ulcer,focus%20on%20each%20in%20detail)). Eradicating H. pylori dramatically reduces ulcer recurrence rates, highlighting its causal role ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=diagnostics%20and%20therapeutic%20advancements,molecular%20insights%20further%20enhance%20our)).

Chronic **NSAID** use is the other leading cause of gastric ulcers, responsible for the majority of H. pylori-negative cases ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=The%20pathophysiology%20of%20gastric%20ulcer,focus%20on%20each%20in%20detail)). NSAIDs (like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) damage the gastric mucosa through both topical and systemic mechanisms. Locally, many NSAIDs are weak acids that become non-ionized in the acidic stomach and diffuse into epithelial cells, where they ionize and trap H<sup>+</sup>, causing intracellular damage and increased permeability of the mucosal barrier ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=gastric%20ulcers%20when%20compared%20to,repair%20after%20injury%20or%20cell)). This ‘‘back-diffusion’’ of acid injures surface cells and strips away the hydrophobic protective phospholipid layer. Systemically, the primary mechanism of NSAID-induced ulceration is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and consequent **prostaglandin** depletion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=often%20disrupted%20by%20external%20factors,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=gastric%20ulcers%20when%20compared%20to,repair%20after%20injury%20or%20cell)). NSAIDs non-selectively inhibit COX-1 (and to varying degrees COX-2), blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. *“The blockade of COX-1 reduces prostaglandin synthesis, impairing mucus and bicarbonate production, epithelial regeneration, and mucosal blood flow, thus exposing the mucosa to acidic and enzymatic damage”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=COX,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). COX-1 (gene **PTGS1**) is constitutively active in the gastric mucosa and produces prostaglandins (e.g. PGE₂) that stimulate mucus and HCO₃⁻ secretion, maintain adequate microcirculation, and promote epithelial cell renewal ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=multiple%20pathways%2C%20including%20damage%20to,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). By suppressing COX-1, NSAIDs remove these gastroprotective factors: gastric mucus and bicarbonate levels fall, surface epithelium turnover slows, and blood flow in the mucosa diminishes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=multiple%20pathways%2C%20including%20damage%20to,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). The mucosa becomes markedly susceptible to attack by stomach acid and pepsin. NSAIDs also contribute to microvascular injury: reduced prostaglandin and nitric oxide levels lead to vasoconstriction and focal ischemia in the stomach wall ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=which%20usually%20increases%20prostaglandin%20synthesis%2C,causes%20in%20the%20gastric%20mucosa)). Neutrophil adherence in gastric capillaries (triggered by NSAIDs) further compromises mucosal blood flow and can cause free radical-mediated damage. Notably, these effects are not just theoretical – epidemiologically, chronic NSAID therapy increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease roughly **four-fold** compared to non-users ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=NSAID%20medications%20are%20the%20other,which%20in%20turn%C2%A0leads%20to%20gastric)). In clinical practice, NSAIDs have now overtaken H. pylori as the most common ulcer precipitant in some Western countries due to widespread use of these drugs ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19575764/#:~:text=ulcers%20,is%20important%20to%20enable%20the)).

Other factors can modulate gastric ulcer pathophysiology. **Smoking** and **heavy alcohol use** are known to impair gastric mucosal defenses and slow ulcer healing (e.g. smoking reduces bicarbonate secretion and blood flow) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=PUD%20arises%20from%20an%20imbalance,18%20%2C%2019)). Psychological **stress** has long been associated with ulcer risk; while not a primary cause, stress can increase vagal output and gastrin release, boosting acid production and exacerbating mucosal injury ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=associations%5B159%20,167)). Hypersecretory conditions like *Zollinger–Ellison syndrome* (gastrinoma producing excessive gastrin) are a rare cause of severe ulcer disease. Additionally, certain medications (e.g. corticosteroids or bisphosphonates) and infections (e.g. CMV in immunocompromised hosts) can precipitate gastric ulcers, though these are less common etiologies ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=,the%20pathophysiology%20of%20gastric%20ulcers)). In all cases, however, the final common pathway is a breakdown of the gastric mucosal integrity due to diminished defenses and/or overwhelming injury, leading to an open sore (ulcer) in the stomach lining ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=in%20the%20gastric%20mucosa)).

### Key Molecular Players  
**Genes/Proteins:** Gastric ulcer pathogenesis is not driven by a single gene defect, but several host and microbial genes play important roles. On the host side, the **PTGS1** and **PTGS2** genes encode cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1/2) enzymes, which are central to prostaglandin synthesis. COX-1 is responsible for generating prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa, while COX-2 is inducible during inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=multiple%20pathways%2C%20including%20damage%20to,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). NSAID-related ulcers result largely from pharmacologically blocking these enzymes, especially COX-1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=multiple%20pathways%2C%20including%20damage%20to,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). *Prostaglandin E₂* (PGE₂), a product of COX-1 activity (**PTGS1**), is a key mediator that normally increases mucus and bicarbonate secretion and mucosal blood flow; loss of PGE₂ due to NSAIDs leads to mucosal vulnerability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=homeostasis.%20In%20contrast%2C%20COX,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). In H. pylori infection, host inflammatory genes are upregulated – for example, **IL1B**, **IL8** (CXCL8), **TNF**, and **IFNG** (interferon-γ) genes are induced by activated immune cells and infected epithelium, driving chronic gastritis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=receptors%20%28TLRs%29%20detect%20pathogen,antimicrobial%20peptides%2C%20type%20I%20interferons)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=diagnostics%20and%20therapeutic%20advancements,molecular%20insights%20further%20enhance%20our)). Certain polymorphisms in pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (e.g. **IL1B**) have been linked to variation in ulcer risk and disease severity, likely by influencing the magnitude of inflammation and acid secretion in response to H. pylori[[^1](#ref-johnson2017)]. In the gastric epithelium, genes regulating apoptosis and cell junctions can be affected by H. pylori’s virulence factors. For instance, the H. pylori *cagA* gene (part of the cag pathogenicity island) encodes the CagA protein, which when injected into cells disrupts signaling (e.g. altering SHP2 phosphatase and β-catenin pathways) and can loosen tight junctions, contributing to epithelial damage and leakage of acid into tissues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L196%20autophagy,38)). The *vacA* gene encodes VacA toxin, which induces vacuole formation and apoptosis in gastric cells and also dampens immune responses as noted above ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L196%20autophagy,38)). Additionally, H. pylori strains possess other genetic factors like *dupA* (duodenal ulcer promoting gene A), *babA*, *oipA*, etc., which have been studied for their association with ulcer risk ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Several%20virulence%20factors%20may%20have,and%20environmental%20factors%20such%20as)). Some *vacA* genotypes (s1/m1 alleles) and presence of *dupA* have been correlated with more severe inflammation and higher incidence of peptic ulcers, although findings are somewhat conflicting ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Several%20virulence%20factors%20may%20have,and%20environmental%20factors%20such%20as)). On the host side, genes involved in acid secretion are indirectly relevant: for example, the **ATP4A** gene encodes the alpha subunit of the gastric H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (proton pump) in parietal cells, which is the final step in acid secretion and the target of proton pump inhibitor drugs. While ATP4A is not mutated in ulcer patients, its activity is modulated by gastrin and neural signals. Genes for hormones and receptors that regulate acid (such as **GAST** for gastrin, **SST** for somatostatin, **CCK-BR** for gastrin receptor, **HRH2** for the histamine H2 receptor on parietal cells) all contribute to the acid homeostasis that H. pylori can perturb ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=gastric%20mucosa,159)). Variants in some of these (e.g. polymorphisms in the genes for IL-1β, TNF-α, and others) have been investigated in relation to H. pylori-associated ulcer and gastric cancer risk, underscoring that a complex polygenic host response influences disease outcome[[^2](#ref-felix2023)]. 

**Chemical Entities:** Numerous biochemical players are involved in gastric ulcer pathology. **Hydrochloric acid (HCl)**, secreted by parietal cells, is the principal chemical aggressor that erodes tissue once the mucosal barrier is compromised ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=PUD%20arises%20from%20an%20imbalance,18%20%2C%2019)). **Pepsin**, a protease produced as pepsinogen by chief cells and activated by low pH, can digest proteins in the unprotected mucosa, exacerbating injury ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=PUD%20arises%20from%20an%20imbalance,18%20%2C%2019)). **Bile acids** (such as duodenal bile refluxing into the stomach) are another irritant that can contribute to gastric ulcer formation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=PUD%20arises%20from%20an%20imbalance,18%20%2C%2019)). On the protective side, **bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻)** is secreted by gastric surface cells to neutralize acid; adequate bicarbonate in the mucus layer is essential to maintain a pH gradient at the epithelial surface. **Prostaglandins** (notably PGE₂ and PGI₂) are key chemical mediators that enhance mucus and bicarbonate production, dilate submucosal blood vessels, and stimulate epithelial repair – all protective actions  ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=COX,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). Loss of prostaglandins (due to COX-1 inhibition by NSAIDs) is a critical biochemical change leading to ulcers ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=multiple%20pathways%2C%20including%20damage%20to,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). **Nitric oxide (NO)**, synthesized by constitutive nitric oxide synthase in the endothelium, works alongside prostaglandins to maintain mucosal blood flow; some NSAIDs also impair NO pathways contributing to vasoconstriction and ischemia. **Ammonia (NH₃)** produced by H. pylori’s urease is another important chemical: it helps the bacterium buffer acid, but ammonia (and the resultant ammonium hydroxide) can directly injure epithelial cells and is pro-inflammatory ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=After%20encountering%20the%20gastric%20environment%2C,25%2C15)). H. pylori’s urease reaction also generates carbon dioxide which, in solution, forms bicarbonate – paradoxically creating pockets of neutral pH that enable H. pylori survival in acid ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=After%20encountering%20the%20gastric%20environment%2C,25%2C15)). **Reactive oxygen species (ROS)** and proteolytic enzymes released by neutrophils in the gastric mucosa are chemical effectors of tissue damage during H. pylori-induced inflammation. In terms of therapeutic chemicals, **proton pump inhibitors** (PPIs, e.g. omeprazole) and **H₂-blockers** (e.g. ranitidine) are drugs that suppress gastric acid – these have revolutionized ulcer management by removing the key chemical aggressor. **Antibiotics** (like clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole) are chemical agents used to eradicate H. pylori, addressing the root cause in infected individuals. **Misoprostol** (a PGE₁ analog) is a medication that chemically mimics prostaglandins to restore mucosal defenses in NSAID users, underscoring the central role of prostaglandin loss in ulcer pathophysiology.

**Cell Types:** Gastric ulcers involve interactions among multiple cell types in the stomach and immune system. The primary cells affected are **gastric epithelial cells**, which line the stomach lumen. These include **surface mucous cells** (foveolar cells) that secrete mucus and bicarbonate, **parietal cells** in the gastric glands that secrete HCl, and **chief cells** that secrete pepsinogen. Ulcer formation entails injury and death of these epithelial cells (via apoptosis or necrosis) and failure of normal restitution. **G cells** (gastrin-secreting enteroendocrine cells in the antrum) and **D cells** (somatostatin-secreting cells) are key regulators of acid secretion; H. pylori-related antral damage to D cells results in unopposed gastrin release from G cells, elevating acid levels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=gastric%20mucosa,159)). **Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells** in the gastric fundus release histamine under gastrin stimulation, further driving parietal cell acid secretion – thus these too contribute to the pathophysiology of H. pylori-associated hyperacidity. On the immune side, **neutrophils** are the first responders in H. pylori infection, attracted by IL-8 and other chemoattractants ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Several%20virulence%20factors%20may%20have,and%20environmental%20factors%20such%20as)). They phagocytose bacteria but also degranulate and release ROS and proteases, collateral damage that harms the mucosa. **Macrophages** and **dendritic cells** in the lamina propria ingest H. pylori and release cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α etc.), sustaining inflammation. Over time, **B-lymphocytes** and **T-lymphocytes** accumulate in the gastric mucosa, sometimes forming lymphoid follicles (MALT) as a chronic response – H. pylori can cause gastric MALT lymphoma via this mechanism, though that is a distinct outcome ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L203%20such%20as,The%20influence%20of%20nickel%20on)). In ulcers, **fibroblasts** in the submucosa and muscularis propria become activated during the healing process, laying down collagen (scar formation). **Endothelial cells** of the submucosal blood vessels are crucial for delivering oxygen and nutrients; their function is impaired when prostaglandins are low, and they can be damaged if an ulcer erodes into blood vessels. Platelets and the coagulation cascade may acutely interact if bleeding occurs. In summary, gastric ulcer pathology spans epithelial cell injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, and later involvement of stromal cells during repair.

**Anatomical Locations:** By definition, gastric ulcers occur in the **stomach (UBERON:0000945)**, most often on the lesser curvature of the stomach or the antral region. The **gastric antrum** (UBERON:0001166), which is the lower part of the stomach, is frequently involved especially in H. pylori-related ulcers, due to the bacterium’s colonization and the acid regulatory changes there ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Knowing%20H,such%20as%20somatostatin%2C%20stimulating%20gastrin)). Ulcers can also occur in the **gastric body** (corpus) or at the **gastric angulus**. The lesion extends through the **gastric mucosa (UBERON:0000341)** into the **submucosa**; a peptic ulcer by definition breaches the **muscularis mucosae** layer. Thus, the ulcer base typically lies in the submucosa or deeper, often with a coating of fibrin, necrotic debris, and granulation tissue. Surrounding the ulcer, the adjacent **lamina propria** is usually infiltrated with inflammatory cells. If an ulcer perforates, it can extend through the **muscularis propria** and **serosa** of the stomach wall, spilling contents into the peritoneal cavity. Key adjacent anatomical structures can be affected: a posterior wall gastric ulcer can penetrate into the **pancreas (UBERON:0001264)**, and an ulcer on the lesser curvature can erode the left gastric artery causing significant hemorrhage. The distinction between **gastric ulcer** and **duodenal ulcer** is an anatomical one (stomach vs. first part of the small intestine), but both share similar mechanisms under the umbrella of peptic ulcer disease. It’s worth noting that H. pylori-associated ulcers reflect the bacterium’s tropism for gastric epithelium – even duodenal ulcers usually occur in areas of gastric metaplasia within the duodenal bulb ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Knowing%20H,such%20as%20somatostatin%2C%20stimulating%20gastrin)). Gastric ulcers are often classified by location (e.g. Type I on the lesser curvature of the corpus, Type II combined with duodenal ulcer, etc.) because blood supply and acid exposure differ by site. The **gastric mucosal barrier**, though not a distinct gross anatomical structure, is effectively a combination of the mucus-bicarbonate layer and tight junctions between epithelial cells; this barrier is considered “anatomical” at the microscopic level and is a critical location where pathophysiology unfolds – H. pylori resides at this interface, and NSAIDs thin this protective layer.

### Biological Processes (GO) Disrupted  
Gastric ulcer formation perturbs numerous biological processes and pathways (many of which correspond to Gene Ontology terms). Key processes affected include:

- **Inflammatory response (GO:0006954)** – Chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa is a hallmark. H. pylori infection triggers an innate immune response (via TLR signaling) and a sustained **immune response to bacterium** (GO:0002227), characterized by neutrophil and macrophage activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=receptors%20%28TLRs%29%20detect%20pathogen,antimicrobial%20peptides%2C%20type%20I%20interferons)). The ongoing production of inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines) and recruitment of leukocytes leads to tissue injury and ulceration instead of resolution ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=diagnostics%20and%20therapeutic%20advancements,molecular%20insights%20further%20enhance%20our)). 

- **Gastric acid secretion (GO:0001696)** – The normal regulation of acid secretion is deranged. In H. pylori infection, inflammation in the antrum causes hypergastrinemia (loss of somatostatin inhibition) and upregulated acid secretion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=gastric%20mucosa,159)). This corresponds to increased **positive regulation of parietal cell acid secretion**. Conversely, extensive colonization of the corpus can cause gastric atrophy and hypo-secretion in some patients. Thus both **hyperacidity** and **hypoacidity** states can occur, but ulcer risk is especially tied to periods of excessive acid relative to mucosal defenses ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Knowing%20H,such%20as%20somatostatin%2C%20stimulating%20gastrin)). 

- **Mucus production and bicarbonate secretion** – These protective secretory processes are diminished, especially with NSAID use. Normally, **epithelial mucus secretion** and **bicarbonate transport** create a pH-neutral microenvironment at the mucosal surface. NSAIDs impair these processes by reducing prostaglandin E₂, leading to a thinner, less alkaline mucus layer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=multiple%20pathways%2C%20including%20damage%20to,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). H. pylori can also reduce mucus viscosity by its ammonia production and mucinase enzymes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=H,21)). The net effect is a breakdown of the **gastric mucus layer maintenance** process.

- **Cell-cell junction organization (GO:0045216)** – H. pylori virulence factors like CagA disrupt tight junctions and adherence junctions between gastric epithelial cells, increasing mucosal permeability. The loss of junctional integrity (a process of **epithelial barrier dysfunction**) allows back-diffusion of acid and pepsin into the tissue, aggravating injury.

- **Apoptotic process (GO:0006915)** – There is enhanced apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells in the presence of both H. pylori and NSAIDs. VacA toxin triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in stomach epithelium (e.g. by causing mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c release) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L196%20autophagy,38)). NSAIDs can also induce apoptosis by disrupting mitochondrial membranes in epithelial cells (a direct cytotoxic effect) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=often%20disrupted%20by%20external%20factors,thus%20exposing%20the%20mucosa%20to)). Excessive cell death without adequate regeneration contributes to ulcer crater formation. 

- **Cell proliferation and healing (GO:0031099 – regeneration)** – Normally, gastric epithelium has a high turnover rate and can repair superficial injury rapidly (restitution). In ulcer disease, the **epithelial cell proliferation** and **migration** processes are overwhelmed or inhibited. NSAIDs, by reducing growth factors and blood flow, delay mucosal regeneration ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=which%20usually%20increases%20prostaglandin%20synthesis%2C,causes%20in%20the%20gastric%20mucosa)). Ongoing inflammation can also impair the **wound healing** process. Only once the injurious factors are removed can normal healing (granulation tissue formation, re-epithelialization) proceed.

- **Prostaglandin biosynthetic process (GO:0001516)** – NSAIDs fundamentally disrupt this process. By inhibiting cyclooxygenases, they halt the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins in the stomach lining, thereby interrupting the **production of prostaglandins** essential for mucosal defense ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=multiple%20pathways%2C%20including%20damage%20to,mucosal%20injuries%2C%20often%20triggered%20by)). 

- **Blood circulation / microcirculation in gastric mucosa** – Adequate blood flow is crucial to provide oxygen and nutrients and remove acid that has diffused into tissue. Normally, prostaglandins ensure vasodilation of submucosal arterioles. NSAIDs cause a **negative regulation of blood circulation in the gastric mucosa** (a component of **response to wounding**), leading to focal ischemia ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=and%20accelerated%C2%A0epithelial%20cell%20restitution%20and,causes%20in%20the%20gastric%20mucosa)). Ischemia exacerbates tissue injury and hinders healing (analogous to what occurs in stress-related ulcers in critically ill patients, where splanchnic ischemia from shock leads to acute ulceration). 

- **Immune evasion processes** – H. pylori actively engages in processes like **negative regulation of T cell activation** and **evasion of host immune response**. For example, H. pylori’s interference with antigen presentation and IL-2 production impairs effective adaptive immunity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L196%20autophagy,38)). This allows the bacterium (and the inflammation) to persist long-term, contributing to ulcer chronicity.

- **Response to oxidative stress** – Neutrophil oxidative burst causes an increase in ROS within the gastric mucosa. Antioxidant defense processes (like glutathione activity) may be depleted. Oxidative damage to epithelial cells and endothelial cells is part of the ulcer pathogenesis when inflammation is present.

Many of these disrupted processes feed into the same outcome: the normal equilibrium between mucosal defense and injury is lost. The **“delicate balance between protective and destructive factors”** is a common theme in pathophysiology discussions ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=diagnostics%20and%20therapeutic%20advancements,molecular%20insights%20further%20enhance%20our)). Ulcer formation represents a tipping of this balance in favor of injury, due to a confluence of altered biological processes.

### Cellular Components Involved  
Key cellular and subcellular locations are integral to gastric ulcer pathophysiology:

- **Gastric mucus layer (extracellular)** – This gel layer overlying the epithelium is the first line of defense. It is enriched with bicarbonate to neutralize acid. H. pylori lives in this mucus layer, a niche where it is protected from bulk acid. The integrity and pH gradient of the mucus layer are vital; disruptions here (thinning of mucus, depletion of bicarbonate) are an initial step toward ulceration ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=H,21)). NSAIDs and bile can solubilize or erode the mucus layer, and H. pylori’s enzymes (e.g. mucinase, protease) physically modify it.

- **Apical cell membranes of gastric epithelial cells** – The surfaces of foveolar cells and gastric gland cells form a tight epithelial lining. This apical membrane, with its cholesterol-rich lipid layer, is where acid and pepsin can attack if not adequately protected. NSAIDs intercalate into cell membranes here, increasing permeability (“uncoupling” the membrane) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=gastric%20ulcers%20when%20compared%20to,repair%20after%20injury%20or%20cell)). H. pylori adheres to the apical membrane of epithelial cells via outer membrane proteins (e.g. BabA binding to Lewis-b antigens). It also injects CagA across the membrane via a Type IV secretion system. VacA toxin can form pores in the cell membrane, allowing anion influx and cell vacuolation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=VacA%20is%20able%20to%20insert,cell%20membranes%20and%20form%20anion)). Thus, the apical plasma membrane is a critical site of pathogen-host interaction and injury.

- **Tight junctions and adherens junctions (cell–cell junctions)** – These structures seal the spaces between adjacent gastric epithelial cells, maintaining the mucosal barrier. They are located at the apicolateral region of cells. H. pylori CagA is known to disrupt tight junction assembly and function (by altering ZO-1, JAM, claudin localization) and can cause loss of epithelial polarity. Junction breakdown permits back-diffusion of H<sup>+</sup> into the epithelium and interstitium, which can lead to deeper injury. So, the **zonula occludens** and related junctional complexes are cellular component targets in ulcerogenesis.

- **Mitochondria** – Within gastric epithelial cells, mitochondria are a key organelle affected by both H. pylori and NSAIDs. VacA toxin can localize to mitochondria and induce cytochrome c release, triggering apoptosis in the host cell ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L196%20autophagy,38)). NSAIDs (especially aspirin and others at high concentration) can uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, leading to energy depletion and cell death in the gastric mucosa. Mitochondrial damage is thus a component of the cellular injury pathway in ulcers ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=often%20disrupted%20by%20external%20factors,thus%20exposing%20the%20mucosa%20to)).

- **Endoplasmic reticulum** – This is where COX enzymes reside (ER membranes) and where prostaglandins are synthesized. NSAID action on COX-1/2 happens at the ER of gastric mucosal cells, blocking the production of prostaglandins that would normally be secreted or act locally.

- **Extracellular space of lamina propria** – Beneath the epithelium, the lamina propria is a connective tissue layer with capillaries, nerve fibers, and immune cells. In gastritis and ulceration, this compartment is edematous and filled with infiltrating neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The lamina propria extracellular matrix (collagen, fibronectin) can be degraded by enzymes from neutrophils (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases), undermining structural support. If an ulcer extends here, granulation tissue (new capillaries, fibroblasts, collagen) will form as part of healing.

- **Blood vessels (submucosal microvasculature)** – These are crucial components supplying the mucosa. The capillaries in the superficial lamina propria and arterioles in submucosa are sites where reduced prostaglandin impact is felt as vasoconstriction. Moreover, ulceration can extend into these vessels, leading to hemorrhage. The points where blood vessels penetrate the muscularis mucosae are often where bleeding occurs if an ulcer erodes a vessel. In a developing ulcer, thrombosis of local microvessels can occur, contributing to ischemic necrosis of tissue.

- **Basement membrane** – Each gastric epithelial cell rests on a basement membrane (basal lamina). In erosive injury, this membrane can initially remain intact, allowing for rapid re-epithelialization. However, once the ulcer breaches the basement membrane and muscularis mucosae, the injury is deeper and the architecture is destroyed – requiring granulation tissue to fill the defect. Fragments of basement membrane components (like type IV collagen, laminin) are often seen at the ulcer base.

- **Nerve endings** – Although not a “cellular organelle,” the sensory nerve endings in the stomach (mostly unmyelinated C-fibers in the submucosa and muscularis) are the components that transmit pain from an ulcer. Exposure of these nerve endings to acid or spasm of the surrounding muscle due to inflammation generates the visceral pain experienced by patients.

In summary, the pathophysiology of gastric ulcer spans multiple cellular components – from the protective mucus layer on the lumenal side, across the epithelial cells, and down to the submucosal blood vessels. Disruption at each level (surface barrier, cell membrane/junctions, subcellular organelles, microcirculation) contributes to the development of an ulcer crater.

### Disease Progression  
The development of a gastric ulcer is typically a gradual process, except in acute stress ulcer scenarios. **Initial stage**: an inciting factor (H. pylori infection or NSAID exposure, or both) leads to **gastritis** or superficial mucosal injury. In H. pylori infection, an acute gastritis may occur shortly after acquiring the bacterium (often in childhood) but is usually asymptomatic or mild ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537128/#:~:text=First%2C%20regarding%20Helicobacter%20pylori%20,bacteria%20has%20remained%20in%20the)). The infection then transitions to **chronic gastritis**, with ongoing inflammation that can persist for years or decades. During this chronic phase, there is a dynamic balance – episodes of mucosal damage and attempts at healing. Patients may have intermittent dyspeptic symptoms or none at all for a long time. **Progression to ulcer**: Over time, if the injurious factors outweigh the protective and reparative capacity, a focal area of mucosa undergoes necrosis that extends through the muscularis mucosae, creating an ulcer crater. This often occurs at sites of highest stress: for example, along the lesser curvature where blood supply might be more tenuous, or in the antrum where H. pylori density is high and acid exposure is significant. The sequence can be envisioned as: **erosion → acute ulcer → chronic ulcer**. An **erosion** is a superficial break in the mucosa that does not penetrate the muscularis mucosae. Erosions can heal quickly (within days) if the cause is removed. However, persistent factors (e.g. continued NSAID use or untreated H. pylori) prevent full healing. The lesion can deepen into the submucosa, becoming an acute ulcer. At this stage, the ulcer base is an acute inflammatory exudate. If healing still does not occur, a **chronic ulcer** forms, characterized pathologically by a base with granulation tissue and fibrosis. Surrounding mucosal folds might become fused into radiating scars as the ulcer fibroses (often seen on endoscopy as folds that converge on the ulcer).

Clinically, once an ulcer has formed, patients may begin experiencing the classic ulcer symptoms (e.g. rhythmic epigastric pain related to meals – see below). Some ulcers, however, remain “silent” (especially NSAID-induced ones in elders) until a complication occurs. If no intervention is made, the natural history can involve cycles of partial healing and re-exacerbation. In *untreated peptic ulcer disease, symptoms often recur* in a cyclic pattern ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L659%20nausea,ulcer%20disease%2C%20symptoms%20often%20recur)). For H. pylori-associated ulcers, the recurrence rate is very high (>50% within a year) if the infection is not eradicated ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=diagnostics%20and%20therapeutic%20advancements,molecular%20insights%20further%20enhance%20our)). Eradication of H. pylori greatly alters the disease course – it promotes ulcer healing and prevents most recurrences (the recurrence rate falls to <10% per year) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=diagnostics%20and%20therapeutic%20advancements,molecular%20insights%20further%20enhance%20our)). Likewise, removing NSAIDs or using protective co-therapy (PPI or misoprostol) allows ulcers to heal and reduces new ulcer formation. 

If injurious factors persist, ulcers can enlarge and deepen. **Complications** mark the severe progression: The two major acute complications are **bleeding** and **perforation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L659%20nausea,ulcer%20disease%2C%20symptoms%20often%20recur)). Bleeding occurs when the ulcer erodes into a submucosal blood vessel. For example, a gastric ulcer on the lesser curvature might hit the left gastric artery branch, causing potentially massive hemorrhage. Patients then present with hematemesis (vomiting blood) or melena (black tarry stools from digested blood) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L659%20nausea,ulcer%20disease%2C%20symptoms%20often%20recur)). Ulcer bleeding can be life-threatening and is a common cause of hospitalization. Perforation is when the ulcer burrows through the full thickness of the stomach wall, spilling gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity. This typically causes sudden, severe abdominal pain and chemical peritonitis (board-like abdominal rigidity on exam) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L659%20nausea,ulcer%20disease%2C%20symptoms%20often%20recur)). A perforated gastric ulcer often requires emergency surgery. Another possible outcome of chronic ulceration is **penetration** – the ulcer continues into adjacent organs. A posterior gastric ulcer can penetrate into the pancreas, for instance, causing referred back pain and even pancreatitis. Long-standing ulcer disease can also lead to **gastric outlet obstruction**: this happens when an ulcer (usually in the pyloric channel or near the pylorus) heals with scar tissue that narrows the outlet, causing vomiting and inability to eat ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L659%20nausea,ulcer%20disease%2C%20symptoms%20often%20recur)). Obstruction is a late complication characterized by gastric retention and distension. 

In terms of **distinct phases**, we can delineate: (1) **Initiation phase** – exposure to risk factors (H. pylori, NSAIDs, etc.) and onset of mucosal inflammation; (2) **Chronic injury phase** – ongoing insult leads to mucosal atrophy and degradation of defenses, with possible pre-ulcerative lesions (erosions); (3) **Ulceration phase** – a full-thickness mucosal defect (ulcer) forms when a critical threshold of injury is reached; (4) **Complication phase** (in some cases) – ulcer enlarges or deepens to cause bleeding, perforation, or obstruction; (5) **Healing phase** – if the cause is removed or mitigated (e.g. appropriate therapy), the ulcer undergoes granulation, re-epithelialization, and scarring. Without continuous insult, most benign gastric ulcers can completely heal over weeks; the mucosa regenerates, but often a scar and regenerated epithelium remain at the site. Notably, gastric ulcers should be monitored until healing, since on rare occasions what appears to be a simple ulcer could be a *malignant ulcer* (gastric carcinoma can present as an ulcer). Therefore, part of disease management is repeat endoscopy to ensure healing and exclude malignancy, especially in older patients or refractory cases.

From a broader perspective, the incidence and overall burden of peptic ulcer disease have been **declining** in recent decades ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=Although%20the%20incidence%20and%20complications,However%2C%20increasing%20antibiotic)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=PubMed%20pubmed,The%20review%20deepens%20into%20H)). This positive trend is attributed to better understanding of the disease’s pathophysiology and subsequent real-world interventions: the eradication of H. pylori with antibiotic therapy, the widespread use of proton-pump inhibitors, and strategies to prevent NSAID ulcers (such as using COX-2 selective inhibitors or co-prescribing PPIs) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12173569/#:~:text=Although%20the%20incidence%20and%20complications,However%2C%20increasing%20antibiotic)). For instance, once H. pylori was identified as the cause of most ulcers, treating the infection led to cure in many patients, something not achievable with acid suppression alone. As a result, complications like ulcer perforation and hemorrhage have become less frequent than they were in the mid-20th century ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=PubMed%20pubmed,The%20review%20deepens%20into%20H)). Nonetheless, due to factors like **aging populations** (with more NSAID use for chronic pain) and rising **H. pylori antibiotic resistance**, gastric ulcers remain a significant health issue ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=diagnostics%20and%20therapeutic%20advancements,molecular%20insights%20further%20enhance%20our)). Management has shifted from emergency surgery for complications to medical therapy and prevention, which directly stems from our improved grasp of ulcer pathophysiology and its causes.

### Phenotypic Manifestations  
Gastric ulcers manifest with both gastrointestinal and systemic signs that reflect the underlying pathophysiological processes. The **hallmark symptom** of a gastric ulcer is *epigastric pain* – typically a burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen. Unlike duodenal ulcer pain, which classically improves with eating, gastric ulcer pain often **worsens shortly after meals** (when acid secretion is stimulated by food) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Gastric%20and%20duodenal%20ulcers%2C%20within,peptic%20ulcer%20disease%20are%20bleeding)). Patients with gastric ulcer may report pain during or 30 minutes to 1 hour after eating, sometimes leading to food aversion. Consequently, **weight loss** is common in gastric ulcer patients, as they eat less to avoid precipitating pain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Gastric%20and%20duodenal%20ulcers%2C%20within,peptic%20ulcer%20disease%20are%20bleeding)). Other gastrointestinal symptoms include **nausea** and **vomiting**, which can occur due to gastric stasis or outlet obstruction if the ulcer causes swelling or scarring near the pylorus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Gastric%20and%20duodenal%20ulcers%2C%20within,peptic%20ulcer%20disease%20are%20bleeding)). Vomiting in the context of an ulcer may also indicate complication (e.g. vomiting blood in case of a bleeding ulcer). Some patients experience **bloating** or an early feeling of fullness (early satiety) if the ulcer is causing edema in the gastric wall. On examination, there may be mild epigastric tenderness, but many patients have an unremarkable abdominal exam.

Importantly, ulcer symptoms can be nonspecific and overlap with gastritis or functional dyspepsia. Thus, alarm features are assessed: **gastrointestinal bleeding** is a serious manifestation – it may be occult (detected by anemia or stool guaiac test) or overt. Overt bleeding presents as **hematemesis** (vomiting of red or “coffee-ground” blood) or **melena** (black, tarry stools resulting from digested blood) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L659%20nausea,ulcer%20disease%2C%20symptoms%20often%20recur)). These signs indicate the ulcer has eroded into a blood vessel, and they warrant urgent intervention. In the event of a perforation, the patient experiences acute **peritonitis**: a sudden onset of intense, sharp abdominal pain with rigidity. This is a surgical emergency. Another phenotype of advanced disease is **gastric outlet obstruction**: patients have persistent vomiting (often of undigested food from earlier meals), abdominal distension after eating, and weight loss. This results from an ulcer near the pylorus healing with scar tissue that narrows the outlet ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=match%20at%20L659%20nausea,ulcer%20disease%2C%20symptoms%20often%20recur)).

Systemically, if chronic blood loss occurs from a gastric ulcer, iron deficiency **anemia** can result (low hemoglobin, fatigue, pallor). The presence of anemia or melena in an older patient with epigastric pain raises concern for an ulcer (or gastric cancer) and necessitates endoscopic evaluation. 

Some phenotypic differences distinguish **gastric vs duodenal ulcers**. As noted, *gastric ulcer pain typically intensifies with meals*, whereas *duodenal ulcer pain often occurs 2–3 hours after eating or at night and is relieved by food* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Gastric%20and%20duodenal%20ulcers%2C%20within,peptic%20ulcer%20disease%20are%20bleeding)). A classic description is that duodenal ulcer patients may wake at night with hunger pain and obtain relief by eating, sometimes gaining weight, whereas gastric ulcer patients might fear eating due to postprandial pain and thus lose weight ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12754294/#:~:text=Gastric%20and%20duodenal%20ulcers%2C%20within,peptic%20ulcer%20disease%20are%20bleeding)). However, individual variations exist, and substantial overlap means this pattern is not diagnostic by itself. 

The connection between symptoms and mechanisms can be traced: the timing of pain with meals in gastric ulcer aligns with acid production – food stimulates acid, which in a person with a compromised mucosal lining will irritate the exposed nerve endings in the ulcer bed, causing pain. Nausea and vomiting may reflect dysmotility due to inflammation (the stomach doesn’t relax and accommodate normally, causing fullness and nausea) or outlet obstruction as mentioned. Weight loss results from both reduced intake (due to pain/anorexia) and malnutrition from fear of eating; it is also a sign that distinguishes ulcer disease from acid reflux in many cases. 

On endoscopy or imaging, a gastric ulcer appears as a distinct crater in the stomach lining, often with heaped-up edges if chronic. Histologically, gastric ulcers demonstrate the so-called “ulcer collar” of layers: necrotic debris on top, fibrin and neutrophils beneath, granulation tissue, and a base of fibrous scar. This corresponds to the chronicity of the ulcer and is why even after healing, the area is not truly “normal” mucosa but rather scarred. There is also an association between long-term H. pylori gastritis (even without ulcers) and gastric mucosal atrophy and **intestinal metaplasia**, which are precursor lesions to gastric cancer. While a benign gastric ulcer itself does not mean cancer, the field change in the stomach due to H. pylori is a risk factor for malignancy over decades. This is another reason H. pylori eradication is advised – it reduces ulcer recurrence and may reduce gastric cancer risk over the long term ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467155/#:~:text=diagnostics%20and%20therapeutic%20advancements,molecular%20insights%20further%20enhance%20our)).

In summary, the phenotype of gastric ulcer disease ranges from mild dyspepsia to life-threatening emergencies, reflecting the extent of mucosal damage. The most common presentation is burning epigastric pain after meals, often accompanied by nausea and reduced appetite. Clinicians correlate these symptoms with the underlying pathophysiology: pain from acid on raw tissue, nausea from disordered gastric motility or pyloric narrowing, and systemic signs such as anemia from chronic blood loss. The concordance of clinical features with the molecular and cellular mechanisms (for instance, pain pattern corresponding to acid secretion cycles, or bleeding tied to vessel erosion) highlights how the pathophysiology of gastric ulcers translates into real-world disease manifestations.
