Disease Pathophysiology Research Template

Target Disease
- Disease Name: Collagenous Sprue (Collagenous Enteritis)
- MONDO ID: (no dedicated MONDO term consistently used in recent literature; entity overlaps clinically/pathologically with collagenous enteritis and sprue-like enteropathy)
- Category: Complex

Pathophysiology description
Collagenous sprue (CS) is a rare enteropathy of the small intestine defined by villous atrophy with a thickened, irregular subepithelial collagen band (>10 μm) that may entrap capillaries and stromal cells, accompanied by intraepithelial lymphocytosis and lamina propria inflammation; endoscopically, diffuse villous blunting and scalloping may be seen, but diagnosis requires histology (trichrome) (mirakhor2021collagenousenteritis–analternative pages 1-3, moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 1-2, moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 4-5). Clinically, patients present with chronic watery diarrhea, profound weight loss, malabsorption, protein‑losing enteropathy, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia; CS often mimics celiac disease but typically shows negative celiac serology and poor response to a gluten‑free diet (mirakhor2021collagenousenteritis–analternative pages 1-3, moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 1-2, mirakhor2021collagenousenteritis–analternative pages 3-4).

Core Pathophysiology
- Primary mechanisms: (1) mucosal immune activation with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria inflammation; (2) epithelial barrier injury with crypt apoptosis and tight‑junction perturbation; and (3) fibroblast/myofibroblast activation leading to excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and a diagnostic subepithelial collagen band, plausibly due to TGF‑β–driven profibrotic signaling together with an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 1-3, zabana2022pathogenesisofmicroscopic pages 10-11, valatas2017stromalandimmune pages 3-4, xiao2009collagenousspruea pages 3-4).
- Dysregulated pathways: Evidence (largely inferential and by analogy to collagenous colitis and intestinal fibrosis) supports roles for TGFB1 signaling, increased TIMP1 with relative reductions/restrictions in MMP1/9 activity, IL‑15/TNF‑α–associated IEL activation and epithelial apoptosis, and barrier protein disruption (ZO‑1/TJP1) (zabana2022pathogenesisofmicroscopic pages 10-11, burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 1-3, valatas2017stromalandimmune pages 3-4, xiao2009collagenousspruea pages 3-4).
- Affected cellular processes: epithelial apoptosis and tight‑junction impairment; fibroblast→myofibroblast differentiation with α‑SMA expression and increased collagen I production; impaired fibrolysis due to MMP/TIMP imbalance; immune cell infiltration (IELs, plasma cells, eosinophils) (burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 1-3, valatas2017stromalandimmune pages 3-4, xiao2009collagenousspruea pages 3-4, moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 4-5).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- 2024 case‑based review emphasizes CS’s association with collagenous gastritis/colitis, autoimmune comorbidities, and severe complications (ulceration, perforation, lymphoma), while also noting some recent reports of favorable responses to immunosuppression (Spanish; full text with diagnostic details including the >10 μm band cutoff and entrapped capillaries) (Sep 2024, Acta Gastroenterológica Latinoamericana; https://doi.org/10.52787/agl.v54i3.383) (moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 1-2, moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 4-5, moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 2-4).
- 2024 case report of olmesartan‑induced collagenous sprue underscores medication‑triggered disease and rapid clinical improvement after drug withdrawal, reinforcing drug‑induced immune/injury mechanisms (Oct 2024, Cureus; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.72571) (goshgarian2024pathognomonicfeaturesof pages 1-2).
- Ongoing synthesis from foundational studies continues to support immune‑mediated mechanisms including IEL activation, crypt apoptosis, and epithelial barrier protein alterations (ZO‑1/TJP1) in ARB enteropathy overlapping with CS (Human Pathology 2016; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humpath.2015.12.001) (burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 1-3, burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 3-5).

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Diagnostic criteria and practice: Recognition that the collagen band threshold >10 μm with trichrome positivity and entrapped capillaries, paired with villous atrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis, is key for diagnosis; multi‑segment evaluation (stomach, colon) is advocated when CS is suspected (moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 4-5, sharma2018collagenousgastritisa pages 1-2, mirakhor2021collagenousenteritis–analternative pages 3-4).
- Medication review and withdrawal: Systematic collection of medication history, particularly ARBs such as olmesartan, PPIs, and NSAIDs, and prompt withdrawal in suspected drug‑induced cases; many patients exhibit clinical and histologic reversal within months (Mayo Clinic Proc 2012; Hum Pathol 2016) (rubiotapia2012severespruelikeenteropathy pages 5-7, burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 3-5).
- Immunosuppression: Corticosteroids (including budesonide) remain first‑line in many reports; refractory cases may respond to thiopurines or TNF‑α inhibitors, though evidence derives from case series and case reports (mirakhor2021collagenousenteritis–analternative pages 3-4, xiao2009collagenousspruea pages 5-6).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mayo Clinic series: Olmesartan‑associated sprue‑like enteropathy likely reflects a delayed cell‑mediated immune reaction in genetically predisposed patients (frequent HLA‑DQ2), with histologic overlap with CS (villous atrophy, IELs, collagen band); clinical and histologic recovery follows drug cessation (Aug 2012, Mayo Clinic Proceedings; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.06.003) (rubiotapia2012severespruelikeenteropathy pages 5-7, rubiotapia2012severespruelikeenteropathy pages 3-4).
- Systematic review emphasis: Immune‑mediated injury plus epithelial barrier disruption (including reports of ZO‑1/TJP1 alterations) underlie ARB enteropathy; frequent collagen deposition links drug‑induced enteropathy to CS phenotype (Apr 2016, Human Pathology; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humpath.2015.12.001) (burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 1-3, burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 5-7, burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 3-5).
- Intestinal fibrosis frameworks: In gut fibrosis, TGF‑β–driven myofibroblast activation, TIMP1 upregulation, and reduced MMP activity drive ECM accumulation—mechanisms broadly consistent with the collagen band in CS (Apr 2017, Annals of Gastroenterology; https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2017.0146) (valatas2017stromalandimmune pages 3-4, valatas2017stromalandimmune pages 2-3).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Demographics: Reported across ages 2–85 years with ~2:1 female predominance; many cases severe with marked weight loss and malnutrition (2021 summary; 2024 case review) (mirakhor2021collagenousenteritis–analternative pages 1-3, moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 2-4).
- Histologic thresholds: Normal subepithelial collagen band ~5–7 μm; cutoff >10 μm used to define CS; bands of 10–20 μm or more with entrapped capillaries and stromal cells are typical (2024 case review) (moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 4-5).
- Drug association prevalence: In early cohorts of olmesartan enteropathy, approximately one‑third of a CS cohort was exposed to olmesartan at or near diagnosis, and most improved after discontinuation (2012 Mayo Clinic Proceedings) (rubiotapia2012severespruelikeenteropathy pages 5-7).

Mechanistic model of disease progression
- Initiation: Environmental/drug triggers (notably ARBs) or autoimmune milieu initiate mucosal immune activation; many patients lack celiac serology and fail gluten‑free diet, implicating alternative triggers (rubiotapia2012severespruelikeenteropathy pages 5-7, mirakhor2021collagenousenteritis–analternative pages 1-3).
- Epithelial insult and immune activation: Increased IELs and cytokine signaling (e.g., IL‑15, TNF‑α, IL‑6) drive crypt epithelial apoptosis; barrier dysfunction is supported by reports of ZO‑1/TJP1 disruption (burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 1-3, burbure2016olmesartanassociatedspruelikeenteropathy pages 3-5).
- Stromal remodeling: TGF‑β–driven fibroblast→myofibroblast differentiation increases COL1A1 and TIMP1 with relatively reduced MMP1/9 activity, favoring ECM accumulation and subepithelial collagen band formation (zabana2022pathogenesisofmicroscopic pages 10-11, valatas2017stromalandimmune pages 3-4, xiao2009collagenousspruea pages 3-4).
- Tissue architecture and clinical phenotype: Collagen band (>10 μm) entrapping capillaries/cells and villous atrophy produce severe malabsorption, protein‑losing enteropathy, and weight loss; multi‑segment involvement (gastritis/colitis) and complications (ulceration, perforation, lymphoma) may ensue (moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 4-5, moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 1-2, rubiotapia2012severespruelikeenteropathy pages 3-4).

Disease Progression
- Sequence: trigger (often medication) → IEL‑driven/immune activation and epithelial apoptosis with barrier loss → TGF‑β–driven myofibroblast activation with net ECM accumulation (↑TIMP1/↓MMP) → subepithelial collagen band and villous atrophy → malabsorption/protein loss → complications (ulceration/perforation; occasional lymphoma) (rubiotapia2012severespruelikeenteropathy pages 5-7, zabana2022pathogenesisofmicroscopic pages 10-11, rubiotapia2012severespruelikeenteropathy pages 3-4, moreno2024spruecolágenogastritis pages 1-2).
- Phases: (i) inflammatory/immune injury; (ii) fibrogenic remodeling; (iii) established collagen band with severe malabsorption; (iv) potential regression if drug withdrawn and/or immunosuppression, although course is heterogeneous (rubiotapia2012severespruelikeenteropathy pages 5-7, mirakhor2021collagenousenteritis–analternative pages 3-4, freeman2010updateoncollagenous pages 1-2).

Notes and limitations
- Collagenous sprue remains rare; mechanistic evidence is drawn from case series/case reports, fibrotic gut biology, and microscopic colitis analogies.
