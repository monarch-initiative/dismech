## Key Findings Summary

### Epidemiology
- Affects approximately 2% of UK population
- No sex prevalence
- Average age 29 years
- ~40% have symptoms since childhood

### Core Symptoms (Diagnostic Criteria)
1. Visual snow (TV static-like flickering dots) - required
2. Plus ≥2 of: palinopsia, photopsia, photophobia, nyctalopia

### Additional Common Symptoms
- Entoptic phenomena (floaters, BFEP, self-light)
- Tinnitus (52-63%)
- Migraine comorbidity (59%)
- Anxiety/depression (40-45%)

### Pathophysiology
- Visual cortex hyperexcitability (lingual gyrus hypermetabolism)
- Impaired inhibitory feedback mechanisms
- Thalamocortical network dysfunction
- Possible glutamatergic/serotonergic involvement

### Treatment Options
- **Lamotrigine**: Best pharmacological evidence (20-60% partial response)
- **Benzodiazepines**: Highest response rate (71%) but long-term concerns
- **Tinted lenses**: FL-41 filters provide consistent relief
- **CBT/Mindfulness**: Emerging nonpharmacological option
- No complete cures reported
