Preface

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disease caused by pathogenic variants in at least 23 genes
that cause faulty DNA repair in every cell of the body. Fanconi anemia is a multi-system
disease and the clinical manifestations are highly variable; therefore, the complexities that
arise require a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to clinical care. In 1999, The
Fanconi Anemia Research Fund published the first edition of a clinical care reference
guide for people affected by the disease and their families. The clinical reference guide
was developed by FA expert physicians with the intent to provide information for care
providers with limited knowledge of this rare disease. Since the first edition was published
in 1999, three subsequent editions were published by the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund
in 2003, 2008, and 2014.
The fifth edition, which is titled Fanconi Anemia Clinical Care Guidelines, is a revision of
the fourth edition published in 2014. The contributing authors are physicians or clinical
care providers with expertise in treating patients with FA. The fifth edition provides
evidence-based recommendations from published peer-reviewed medical literature and is
geared toward clinical providers as the primary intended audience. Where possible, the
chapters have been peer-reviewed and effort was made to provide a balanced view on
discordant medical opinions.
The fifth edition starts with a brief summary of the molecular mechanisms of the FA DNA
repair pathway (Chapter 1). Over the past few decades, researchers have charted the
complexities of the FA DNA repair pathway with the hope that unlocking mechanisms that
drive faulty DNA repair in FA cells would enable development of new treatments for the
disease. Although research on the FA pathway has expanded knowledge of the
coordinated events that lead to FA cell fragility, more work is needed to develop a
comprehensive understanding of how targeting the pathway can be exploited as a way to
treat the clinical manifestations of FA.
Beyond an overview of the FA pathway, the fifth edition covers the diagnostic testing
process for FA (Chapter 2). The chromosome breakage test remains the gold standard
diagnostic test for FA; however, molecular diagnostics, such as whole genome or exome
sequencing, are quickly becoming important components of the diagnostic cascade. The

## Page 9

inheritance patterns of FA, genetic testing for family members, and updated information
regarding cancer risk for carriers of FA variants is also discussed in Chapter 2.
Monitoring the onset of bone marrow failure (BMF) in persons with FA and treatment
recommendations for when it occurs are outlined in Chapter 3. To date, hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT) is the only curative treatment option for BMF for persons with FA. The
fifth edition provides an overview of recent advancements in HCT published in peer-
reviewed clinical research studies. Advancements in HCT protocols and long-term care
continue to improve survival rates of persons with FA following HCT. Despite these
advancements, the high risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in individuals
who have undergone an HCT is a major concern. The development of HCT-related graft-
versus-host disease is correlated with increased risk; however, it is unclear whether
additional factors associated with the HCT process also confer an increased risk. It is
thought that the use of genotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens may
contribute to increased risk, but more studies are needed to delineate the specifics of each
contributing factor. The Fanconi Anemia Research Fund is currently supporting ongoing
pre-clinical research focused on using antibody depletion of stem cells as a way to reduce
toxic conditioning regimens. Results from these studies may provide a new way to perform
HCT that decreases SCC risk. Gene therapy trials are also underway as a curative approach
for BMF in patients with FA; however, it is too early to know whether these trials will be
successful.
The risk of developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and SCC in
anogenital regions is extremely high for persons with FA. There is also an increased risk of
developing non-HNSCC solid tumors in other areas of the body (Chapter 4). The risk of
solid tumors is age-dependent and associated with undergoing HCT, but risk is also high in
patients who have never undergone HCT. Most non-HNSCC and HNSCC tumors develop in
patients with FA at a substantially younger age than in the general population (20-50 years
vs. 60-70 years). Chapters 5 and 7 cover updated recommendations for early surveillance,
prevention, and treatment of HNSCC and anogenital SCC in patients with FA, respectively.
New in the fifth edition is the recommendation to perform comprehensive oral
examination combined with brush biopsy of suspicious HNSCC lesions (Chapter 5), to
determine whether the presence of pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions warrant further
analysis by incisional biopsy. Individuals with FA often have multiple lesions in their oral
cavities and use of brush biopsies as an early surveillance tool reduces trauma and leads
to early diagnosis of cancer when successful surgical removal is possible. Surgical removal
of tumors, both HNSCC and anogenital SCC, remains the best option for curative treatment
for persons with FA, although radiation therapy has proved efficacious in some cases. More
research is needed to understand the natural history of FA SCC tumors to develop
chemopreventive or non-genotoxic treatment modalities. Identifying methods to prevent
and treat FA SCC tumors will be a high priority for the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund in
the coming years.

Fanconi anemia is a multi-system disease and hematologic manifestations and cancer are
not the sole problems for patients with FA. Comprehensive care for FA patients requires an
interdisciplinary team that focuses on all body systems simultaneously. The fifth edition
covers recommendations for optimal oral health care (Chapter 6), gynecologic care and
infertility (Chapter 7), dermatologic issues (Chapter 8), and gastrointestinal and endocrine
issues (Chapters 9 and 10, respectively). Expert opinion on how to manage auditory
problems (Chapter 11) and skeletal anomalies (Chapter 12) is also covered.
The final chapter (Chapter 13) provides a brief overview of the care recommendations
mentioned throughout other chapters. The chapter also provides currently available care
recommendations for adults who have FA. Persons with FA are surviving longer due to
advancements in HCT and diagnosis of the disease in adults is occurring more often. Filling
the gaps that exist around transitioning from pediatric to adult care and specific
recommendations for the myriad of issues adults with FA face will be a focus for the
Fanconi Anemia Research Fund in the coming years.
Starting in 2021, the Fanconi Anemia Clinical Care Guidelines, and all subsequent revisions,
will be available on the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund website in an interactive format.
The virtual resource guide will enable rapid incorporation of peer-reviewed updates for
clinical care recommendations. The FA field changes rapidly and providing timely access
to up-to-date recommendations is imperative. Printed editions of content from the website
will be made available every five years.
On behalf of the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund, we extend a profound thank you to the
many authors who contributed to the Fanconi Anemia Clinical Care Guidelines fifth
edition. We also extend a heartfelt appreciation for individuals with FA and their families
without whom this publication would not have been possible. It is our hope that this
resource guide will serve as a valuable resource for physicians who treat patients with FA
and ultimately, that it will extend lives and improve the quality of life of those affected by
the disease.

Chapter 1
The Fanconi Anemia
DNA Repair Pathway

Introduction
Discovery of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia (FA) and the role of
FA proteins in regulating DNA repair have been active areas of
research over the last 30 years. In the last edition of the clinical care
guidelines published by the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund in 2014,
16 FA genes had been discovered. Researchers have now identified 23
genes that, when mutated, cause FA, including FANCA [1], FANCB [2],
FANCC [3], FANCD1/BRCA2 [4], FANCD2 [5], FANCE [6], FANCF [7],
FANCG [8], FANCI [9-11], FANCJ/BRIP1 [12], FANCL [13], FANCM [14-
17], FANCN/PALB2 [18], FANCO/RAD51C [19, 20 ], FANCP/SLX4 [21,
22], FANCQ/ERCC4 [23], FANCR/RAD51 [24, 25], FANCS/BRCA1 [26],
FANCT/UBE2T [27-29], FANCU/XRCC2 [30], FANCV/REV7 [31],
FANCW/RFWD3 [32], and FANCY/FAP100 [33].

Fanconi anemia is a multi-system disease caused by defects in the ability of cells to repair
damaged DNA. Cells from patients with FA are unable to repair DNA interstrand crosslinks
(ICLs), which are lesions that covalently link two strands of DNA and inhibit the essential
cellular processes of DNA replication and transcription. This chapter provides a brief

## Page 12

summary of new research advancements on the molecular mechanisms of the FA DNA
repair pathway. The relationship between the FA DNA repair pathway and toxins such as
aldehydes and stem cell failure are also discussed. This chapter should not be considered
a complete overview of all research on the pathway that has been published to date.
Readers are encouraged to access references and review articles cited in the chapter for
additional details.

The Fanconi Anemia DNA Repair Pathway
The Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins participate in a coordinated set of events that lead to
the repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) when the FA DNA repair pathway is activated
during DNA replication (Figure 1, reviewed in [34-36]). The key event in the FA DNA repair
pathway is the monoubiquitination of the FANCI and FANCD2 proteins (commonly referred
to as the I-D2 or D2-I complex) [5, 9-11, 37, 38]. Monoubiquitination of the I-D2 complex
depends on FANCL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase which works together with FANCT/UBE2T, an E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme [27-29, 39]. FANCL is a component of a multi-subunit
complex called the FA core complex. The core complex contains FANCA, FANCB, FANCC,
FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and the FA associated proteins (FAAP) FAAP20 and
FAAP100 [40-42]. Deficiency of any of the core complex subunits leads to FA [1-3, 6-8, 13].
FANCM together with FAAP24 associates with the FA core complex, but its absence only
partially reduces FANCI and FANCD2 ubiquitination [43, 44] and patients with biallelic
mutations in FANCM have distinct presentation from the majority of FA patients (see
Chapter 2) [16, 17, 45, 46]. FANCM is thought to participate in the activation of the FA
pathway by localizing the core complex to chromatin and also through its role in
activation of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), a DNA damage responsive
kinase that phosphorylates multiple FA proteins [47]. FANCM also has been shown to be
necessary for an early event during ICL repair, to promote skipping or “traverse” of the ICL
lesion by the replication machinery [48, 49].
The FA core complex is necessary for the activation of its catalytic subunit, FANCL, and
also for positioning its two substrates, FANCI and FANCD2, in proper orientation for
monoubiquitination [50, 51]. The monoubiquitinated I-D2 complex stably localizes to
lesions by encircling the DNA [52, 53]. Monoubiquitinated FANCI and FANCD2 are thought
to facilitate the downstream repair events of DNA cutting and repair of the cut DNA [54,
55]. FANCQ/XPF is the essential nuclease that makes incisions around the lesion, a step
called “unhooking” [23, 56]. XPF unhooking activity in this step is dependent on
FANCP/SLX4, a protein scaffold for three nucleases [21, 22, 56-60]. Once the lesion is
unhooked, a specialized translesion polymerase, Polζ, which includes FANCV/REV7 [31, 54],
synthesizes DNA across the unhooked lesion creating a substrate for homologous
recombination (HR) proteins. FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCN/PALB2,

## Page 13

11
FANCO/RAD51C, FANCR/RAD51, FANCS/BRCA1, FANCU/XRCC2 and FANCW/RFWD3 are
proteins that participate in or regulate HR during ICL repair [4, 12, 18, 19, 24, 26, 30, 32, 61-
64]. Some of the HR proteins, FANCR/RAD51 and FANCD1/BRCA2, also work at earlier
steps of repair to protect the DNA at the ICL from inappropriate degradation by the DNA2
nuclease-Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase (WRN) complex [24, 64]. It is also
important to note that the homologous recombination proteins indicated above
participate in repair of DNA double-stranded breaks during DNA replication and are major
tumor suppressors in the cell (reviewed in [65]). Once the ICL repair is completed, the
pathway is turned off by a deubiquitinating enzyme, ubiquitin specific peptidase 1 (USP1)
[66].
In addition to participating in ICL repair, FA proteins are also active at other sites in the
genome during DNA replication where they respond to replication stress, which is defined
as any event that stalls the replication machinery. The FA proteins protect the newly-
replicated (nascent) DNA strands when replication is stalled [67, 68] (reviewed in [69]).
They function at sites of under-replicated DNA, known as common fragile sites [70-72], and
have been shown to play a role in the clearance of DNA:RNA hybrids, which form during
transcription and are enhanced by replication and transcription machinery collisions [73,
74].

molecular pathway and additional proteins that participate in ICL repair, please see recent
reviews [34-36]. For the latest study on the earliest steps of the pathway regulation during
replication by the TRAIP protein, see reference [75] and for the studies on ICL traverse see
references [48, 49, 76, 77]. See text for details.

The Fanconi Anemia DNA Repair Pathway and
Toxic Metabolites
The underlying pathophysiology of Fanconi anemia (FA) is best understood for the
hematopoietic system, although more research in this area is needed. Hematopoietic stem
cells (HSC) with a faulty FA pathway have increased levels of DNA damage and their
attrition is an outcome of activation of the p53 pathway, which initiates apoptosis [78]. It
also has been shown that driving quiescent/resting HSCs to enter the cell cycle by chronic
bleeding or induction of type I interferon response can trigger bone marrow failure (BMF)
in FA-deficient mice [79].These findings are consistent with the FA DNA repair pathway
responding to problems encountered during DNA replication. These problems may occur
at the sites of replication stress as defined above or may occur at the sites of DNA ICLs
caused by metabolites that accumulate when stem cells divide or differentiate.
Endogenous metabolites, especially reactive aldehydes, including acetaldehyde and
formaldehyde, have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of HSC failure and
tumorigenesis in FA [80-83]. Mice deficient in ALDH2, the enzyme which detoxifies
acetaldehyde, develop bone marrow failure and leukemia [80, 81], which are common
outcomes observed in patients with FA (see Chapter 3). Lack of the ADH5 enzyme, which
participates in formaldehyde detoxification, leads to the development of bone marrow
failure even faster in a mouse model of FA deficiency [82]. The mouse studies identifying
genetic interaction between acetaldehyde and the FA DNA repair pathway have been
corroborated in patients with FA. A dominant negative variant in ALDH2 (ALDH2*2, rs671
G>A) is common in East Asian peoples, including Han Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans [84].
Carriers of this variant have greatly diminished enzymatic activity and biallelic variants
result in almost absent activity [85, 86]. Hira et al. studied a cohort of Japanese FA patients
and showed that the patients who carried the ALDH2*2 variant displayed an increased
number of congenital abnormalities, earlier onset of bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic
syndrome, and leukemia [83]. Presence of the biallelic ALDH2*2 variants exacerbated the
FA-associated phenotypes even more dramatically, leading to a severe disease
presentation.
In light of the above studies, it is useful to think of a two-tier system to illustrate how
mammalian cells protect themselves from endogenous toxic metabolites (Figure 2,
reviewed in [87]). As toxic metabolites are produced by normal cellular metabolism or as a
result of ingestion (for example alcohol), enzymes including aldehyde and alcohol
dehydrogenases, detoxify the toxic metabolites into non-toxic molecules. Even with a fully-
functioning first tier of protection, some toxic metabolites escape detoxification and cause
DNA lesions. The FA DNA repair pathway, the second tier of protection, is then needed to
remove the resulting DNA lesions to prevent cell death or mutagenesis. In the scenario
where more lesions result due to the deficiency of the first tier of protection of enzymatic

## Page 16

14
detoxification, cells are even more reliant on an efficient DNA repair pathway due to a
greater burden of damaging DNA lesions. Thus, deficiency of both tiers of protection leads
to severe disease. This paradigm may be used outside of hematopoietic stem cells and for
epithelial cells from which squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) develop. This would be an
important association considering patients with FA have an increased risk of developing
SCC (see Chapters 4 through 7). However, the toxic metabolite implicated in generating
DNA lesions likely will be dependent on tissue type. Understanding the sources of the
endogenous DNA damage in FA cells will certainly contribute to understanding of the
pathogenesis of the disease and may lead to development of new therapies.

The first tier, which includes ALDH2 and ADH5, detoxifies metabolites (acetaldehyde and
formaldehyde, respectively) that have potential to damage DNA. The Fanconi anemia DNA

Summary
Fanconi anemia (FA) is caused by faulty DNA repair of interstrand
crosslinks (ICLs) in every cell in patients with the disease. Researchers
have discovered 23 genes to date that cause FA and have established
many key molecular mechanisms that regulate the FA DNA repair
pathway. The absence of functional repair of ICLs can affect stem cells
in particular, which results in many of the phenotypic manifestations
associated with the disease. Bone marrow failure resulting from
hematopoietic stem cells exposed to endogenous or exogenous toxic
metabolites in the context of faulty FA DNA repair has been well-
characterized. However, more research is needed to develop a
comprehensive understanding of how a faulty FA DNA repair pathway
causes FA and squamous cell carcinoma and how mechanisms
regulating the pathway can be exploited for novel treatments for
patients with FA.

Chapter 2
Diagnosis of Fanconi Anemia:
Testing and Genetic
Counseling

Introduction
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a very rare genetic disorder that results from
DNA repair defects arising from pathogenic variants in at least 23
genes (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE,
FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, FANCN/PALB2,
FANCO/RAD51C, FANCP/SLX4, FANCQ/ERCC4, FANCR/RAD51,
FANCS/BRCA1, FANCT/UBE2T, FANCU/XRCC2, FANCV/REV7,
FANCW/RFWD3, and FANCY/FAP100) discovered to play a role in the
FA pathway (see Chapter 1). All pathogenic variants in these genes
are autosomal recessive, except FANCB, which is x-linked, and
FANCR/RAD51, which is autosomal dominant. The carrier frequency
of FA is 1:181 in the general population in North America and 1:93 in
Israel [1]. Specific populations have a founder effect with increased
carrier frequencies (1 per 100 or less), for example Ashkenazi Jews
(FANCC and FANCD1/BRCA2) [2, 3], Afrikaners (FANCA) [4], sub-
Saharan Africans (FANCG) [5], Spanish gypsies (FANCA) [6], and South
Asians from India and Pakistan (FANCL) [7]. The wide spectrum of
disease presentation in individuals with FA is closely tied to the
relationship between clinical features of the disease and the
underlying genetic cause. Early diagnosis and the characterization of
patient-specific pathogenic variants  (historically called mutations) is

## Page 24

22
of utmost importance as this information may influence a patient’s
clinical management, especially for severe cases. This chapter
discusses the importance of early diagnosis and the role of genetic
counseling and specific cytogenetic and molecular tests used to
diagnose FA. Also included are test interpretation considerations for
accurate diagnosis that can aid clinical management and facilitate
appropriate testing for family members.

Clinical Manifestations and Evaluation for
Diagnosis
Most patients with Fanconi anemia have manifestations either at birth or during
childhood. The median age at diagnosis is 7 years [8, 9], although it is typically younger if
the clinical phenotype is more severe [10]. Those without overt congenital differences may
not be diagnosed until adulthood unless they develop bone marrow failure (BMF) (see
Chapter 3) or a solid tumor (see Chapters 4 and 5).
Physical Phenotype
The physical phenotype associated with FA is extremely heterogenous and multisystemic,
but can offer clues for testing and early diagnosis [9]. The classical congenital
abnormalities seen in patients with FA include those described in the VACTERL-H
(Vertebral, Anal, Cardiac, Tracheo-esophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, Renal, upper
Limb and Hydrocephalus) association [11]. In a recent comprehensive literature review of
FA cases, the proportion of FA patients who met criteria for VACTERL-H association
(presence of at least 3 of the 8 common features) was 12% [12], which was similar to prior
studies (5% to 30%) [13, 14]. Other abnormalities common to FA were recently grouped
with the acronym PHENOS (skin Pigmentation, small Head, small Eyes, Nervous system,
Otology, and Short stature) [13]. In the previously mentioned literature review, 9% of the
patients with FA had ³4/6 features of PHENOS [12]. The most frequent abnormalities
described are: short stature, skin pigmentary changes, upper limb malformations, male
genitalia abnormalities, microcephaly, ophthalmic and renal manifestations [9]; all, except
for the male genitalia anomalies, are included in VACTERL-H or PHENOS. Although the
majority of patients will have at least one abnormality, between 25-40% will have none,
thus the absence of abnormal features does not rule out the diagnosis [13, 14]. The
information listed in Table 1 can be used as a guide for evaluating a patient whose
appearance suggests a diagnosis of FA. Any combination of the abnormalities listed in
Table 1 should raise the level of suspicion for FA.

Diagnostic Testing
Any physician who suspects that a patient may have FA should refer the patient to a
hematologist and/or clinical geneticist or genetic counselor who can arrange for
diagnostic testing.
All laboratories involved in the testing (both the cytogenetic and molecular laboratories)
should be accredited by a recognized regulatory body and certified to perform FA testing
for clinical care. Recognized accreditation bodies in the United States, Canada, and Europe
are as follows:
United States
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and the College of American
Pathologists (CAP) provide laboratory certification and accreditation.
• The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) provides detailed
guidelines for cytogenetic testing and the interpretation of the results of genetic
testing [15].
Canada
• The Ontario Laboratory Accreditation and the Canadian College of Medical Genetics
(CCMG) provide laboratory oversight and guidelines, respectively.
Europe
• The Belgian Accreditation Council (BELAC), the French Accreditation Committee
(COFRAC), the Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle (DAkkS), the Swiss Accreditation Service
(SAS), and the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) provide accreditation
services.

As FA testing is highly specialized, particularly for evaluation of chromosome breakage in
response to DNA damage, only laboratories with extensive experience should undertake
this testing.
The recommended testing procedures are outlined in the flow chart in Figure 1. The flow
chart presents one potential algorithm for testing, starting with chromosome breakage,
and followed by molecular evaluation. However, as genetic testing has become
increasingly utilized as a front-line diagnostic test for newborns and pediatric patients
with multiple congenital anomalies, the order of testing in these cases may be reversed.
Most important, both chromosome breakage and germline genetic testing (described in
the following sections) should be applied to each patient for precise diagnosis.
Chromosome Breakage Test in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes
The chromosome breakage test is the first test that should be performed for an individual
suspected of having FA. This assay is performed in a clinical cytogenetics laboratory, often

## Page 27

25
using a sample of the patient’s peripheral blood. Lymphocytes isolated from the blood
sample are treated with DNA cross-linking agents; the most commonly used for FA testing
are diepoxybutane (DEB) and mitomycin C (MMC) and the chromosomes are examined for
evidence of chromosomal breakage [16, 17]. Cells from individuals who do not have FA
have relatively few chromosome breaks or other rearrangements detected. In contrast,
cells from patients with FA typically show multiple chromosomal breaks and
rearrangements per cell, including complex rearrangements such as radial figures. As
detailed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines for
cytogenetic laboratories [18], the test results report should include the breakage and
rearrangement rates, as well as the distribution of chromosomal breakage among cells or
the average number of aberrations per cell with and without radial figures. Further, all
tests should include at least two independent cultures (e.g., samples treated with different
concentrations of MMC, or one sample treated with MMC and the second with DEB, or
another relevant combination) to show that the results are reliable. Because some
patients’ specimens will have very low white blood cell counts, it may not be possible to
set up two cultures for a given test. In such cases, a second specimen should be obtained
from the patient, if possible, to confirm the findings obtained from the first culture.
Figure 1. Schematic representing a suggested algorithm for Fanconi anemia testing.
The gold-standard test for diagnosing Fanconi anemia (FA) is the chromosome breakage
test (CBT) using the DNA cross-linking agents mitomycin C (MMC) and diepoxybutane
(DEB) (orange box). If a patient has a negative CBT (green boxes), no further testing is
necessary unless there is strong clinical suspicion. In this case, a skin cell CBT should be
performed. If the CBT has a positive result (yellow boxes), targeted FA gene panel should
be performed. If the targeted panel is negative, whole exome or whole genome

sequencing can be performed. An equivocal or inconclusive result (blue boxes) will require
next generation sequencing for variants that cause other chromosome instability
syndromes, or a skin CBT for confirmation of FA.
The laboratory should also measure baseline chromosome breakage by evaluating cells
that have not been treated with MMC and/or DEB. The measurements of baseline
breakage can vary markedly among patients with different FA variants. For example,
patients with variants in the FANCD1/BRCA2 or FANCN/PALB2 genes have very high levels
of baseline breakage and unusual constellations of abnormalities compared with other
groups of patients with FA [19]. The baseline breakage also may aid the differential
diagnosis of other chromosome instability disorders that display specific types of
chromosomal abnormalities, such as rearrangements of chromosomes 7 and/or 14, which
commonly occur in ataxia-telangiectasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome; telomeric
rearrangements, which often occur in dyskeratosis congenita; and premature centromere
separation, which are characteristic of Roberts syndrome and Warsaw breakage syndrome
[20-25]. Finally, if the breakage is evaluated on G-banded chromosome preparations, it will
be possible to rule out constitutional chromosome abnormalities that may provide an
alternative diagnosis for the patient’s clinical findings. The latter have been documented
in approximately 1-2% of patients referred to rule out FA.
Cell Cycle Analysis in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes
Mitomycin C and/or DEB-induced chromosome breakage analysis is the most common
first-line test for the diagnosis of FA. However, a few laboratories measure cell cycle
kinetics, rather than chromosome breakage, in peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with
mitogen and DNA cross-linking agents [26, 27]. Normal lymphocytes that do not have any
DNA damage will progress through all the normal phases of the cell cycle without
significant delay. However, cells that have DNA damage will stop at the S/G2 phase of the
cycle to repair the damage before they progress to M phase. Because FA cells have more
unrepaired damage after treatment with DNA crosslinking agents, a higher percentage of
cells (generally 40% or more) from FA patients will be arrested during the S/G2 phase
when compared to cells from individuals without FA. Some laboratories may use cell cycle
analysis in conjunction with a chromosome breakage test for research purposes. Although
cell cycle analysis is not currently used in the clinical setting, the principles and flow chart
delineated for the chromosome breakage test should be applied. Positive, negative, and
equivocal results should be followed as described for the chromosome breakage test
results delineated in Figure 1.
Interpreting Chromosome Breakage Test Results
Although chromosome breakage is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of FA, there
is still the possibility that a test result is a “false positive” (the test is positive but the
patient does not have FA) or that a test result is a “false negative” (the test gives a negative

## Page 29

27
result but the patient does have FA). Critical to the interpretation of the laboratory results
is the establishment of positive and negative control ranges by the laboratory. In order to
establish these ranges, the laboratory must have tested a sufficient number of patients
(typically 30 or more) with a confirmed diagnosis of FA. Situations that may yield a false
negative or false positive test result are described in the following sections.
Positive Test Result
A patient is considered to have a positive test for FA if the lymphocytes display markedly
increased chromosomal breakage and rearrangement after treatment with MMC and/or
DEB compared with their baseline breakage. Typically, more than 90% of the metaphase
cells examined in the MMC or DEB treated culture from an individual with FA will show
increased breakage, and the rates and types of breakage observed will fall within the
laboratory’s established FA range. After a positive result, a genetic counselor can help
coordinate the necessary follow up. Importantly, follow-up testing should be performed to
identify the patient’s pathogenic variant(s) using the molecular methods described in this
chapter.
In some cases, a diagnosis of FA may be suspected only after the individual has been
diagnosed with a cancer, such as leukemia or a solid tumor. The physician may suspect FA
because this patient experiences severe side-effects from the therapy that is given to treat
the cancer. Evaluating MMC and DEB chromosomal breakage test is warranted.
Negative Test Result
A test result is considered negative if the metaphase cells from the MMC or DEB treated
culture do not show increased chromosomal breakage or rearrangement, and if the rates
of observed breakage are within the laboratory’s established normal range. If the
chromosome breakage test is negative and the clinical evidence that the patient may have
FA is weak, no further studies are needed. By contrast, if the chromosome breakage test is
negative but there is strong clinical evidence that the patient may have FA, then skin
fibroblast testing should be performed to rule out the possibility of somatic mosaicism, as
described below. In addition, there are multiple disorders that have some clinical features
in common with FA and are associated with some form of chromosome instability [20-25].
Therefore, patients who have a negative chromosome breakage test should be evaluated
by a clinical genetics service as additional genetic testing may be warranted.
Equivocal Test Result
Test results are considered equivocal, or inconclusive, if the percentage of cells that
display chromosomal breakage patterns characteristic of FA is lower than the laboratory
typically sees for FA, or if there is increased breakage but the types of breakage are not
characteristic of FA. The average number of breaks per cell may fall above the upper limit
of the normal control range, but below the lower limit of the laboratory’s FA range.
Underlying causes of inconclusive results include mosaicism in the patient’s peripheral

## Page 30

28
blood cells, hypomorphic alterations, and the possibility that the patient has a condition
other than FA that manifests with increased chromosomal breakage.
Mosaicism in Peripheral Blood Cells
Somatic mosaicism can occur in T-lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells due to the
reversion of an inherited variant in an FA gene. Testing to detect mosaicism should be
performed if the clinical evidence that the patient may have FA is strong, but the
peripheral blood chromosome breakage test results were reported as negative or
equivocal. Mosaicism can be diagnosed by sending a sample of the patient’s skin, obtained
via a skin biopsy, to a certified clinical cytogenetics laboratory, which can perform the
MMC/DEB chromosome breakage test on fibroblast cells. The diagnosis of FA can be
confirmed by a chromosome breakage test that reveals increased breakage in the
fibroblasts, with the types of breaks and rearrangements characteristic of FA.
Approximately 10-20% of patients with FA have a form of mosaicism in which the
fibroblast cultures show increased breakage, while the lymphocytes do not. The
percentage of normal cells in the blood of these patients may range from less than 50% to
100%. Over time, a patient with a low percentage of normal cells may develop a high
percentage of normal cells, and this process may be associated with spontaneous
improvement in the patient’s blood cell counts. However, the mosaicism measured in
peripheral blood lymphocytes may not reflect mosaicism in the bone marrow cells. This
means that a patient with a high percentage of normal cells in the tested lymphocytes
may have no (or a very low percentage of) normal cells in his or her bone marrow. As the
bone marrow cells are involved in the development of leukemia, their status should not be
generalized from the lymphocyte results. It is not possible to directly test the bone marrow
cells using the same chromosome breakage tests used for lymphocytes; thus, it remains
unclear whether the clinical course of the disease will be altered in patients who have
normal cells in the peripheral blood. Importantly, the presence of mosaicism—in either
the blood or the bone marrow—does not protect the individual from the development of
clonal chromosome abnormalities within the population of cells that retain their FA gene
variants, which may lead to the development of hematologic malignancies. In addition,
mosaicism in the blood or bone marrow also does not protect against the development of
solid tumors.

Germline Genetic Testing
If the results from the chromosome breakage test are positive, genetic testing should be
performed to identify the specific FA-causing variants. Genetic testing enables accurate
diagnosis and improves clinical care for individuals with anticipated genotype/phenotype
manifestations and for relatives who are heterozygous carriers of FA gene variants that
confer increased risk for malignancy (see Carrier Cancer Risk section in this chapter).

## Page 31

29
Further, genetic analysis is useful for preconception screening, prenatal diagnosis, and
required for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (see Chapter 7).
Next Generation Sequencing
Until recently, a genetic test known as complementation analysis was the primary method
available for determining which FANC genes were altered in a given patient. However,
complementation analysis is labor-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming. Over the
course of the past decade, the development and expansion of next generation sequencing
(NGS) technologies, also referred to as massively parallel sequencing or multiplex testing,
have transformed the field of genetic testing because they enable detailed analysis of
numerous genes simultaneously. Following a positive chromosome breakage test, NGS
panel testing for clinically available FA genes should be offered as the next step of testing.
Clinical labs have evolved to offer two types of panel tests: dedicated panels (laboratory
pre-selected genes associated with a patient’s phenotype) and custom panels (self-
selection of desired genes from a large list). When selecting a panel, it is important to
consider whether the test has been designed to address variant hotspots and/or gene
regions known to present reporting challenges. As an example, the FANCD2 gene is known
to have two pseudogenes that can complicate the accuracy and interpretation of testing
[28, 29]. Due to the rapidly evolving knowledge of FA, many laboratories have not yet been
able to add the more recently discovered FA genes to their panels. Thus, the majority of
panels currently available evaluate only a subset of the 23 known FA genes [30, 31].
In addition to sequencing, testing should always include copy number analysis that will
identify large deletions, duplications and insertions [32]. This is critical as 35% of FA
patients harbor large deletions that account for 18% of all FA pathogenic variants [33].
Due to the high rate of copy number variants, techniques that can detect gene deletions,
duplications, and insertions, such as array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH),
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or NGS-based copy number
analysis, are an important part of the genetic testing process; and, it should be determined
whether this type of assessment is included in the chosen test platform. Copy number
variants (CNV) can be performed in tandem with panel testing or as a reflex test. In cases
where the diagnosis of FA is in question, broader panels targeting a specific phenotype
such as bone marrow failure or MDS/AML may be considered. Broad panels often are not
comprehensive for each of the syndromes they analyze, so an FA-specific panel is still
preferred when the diagnosis of FA is considered likely.
Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing
Whole exome sequencing (WES) is an NGS approach that is more expansive than the
sequencing of targeted panels of genes. This technique aims to sequence all the exons and
splice sites of all known genes, which represent approximately 2% of the human genome.
An even more expansive NGS application is whole genome sequencing (WGS), which

## Page 32

30
analyzes the entire human genome. Clinical WGS recently has been made available;
however, the analysis largely remains focused on exons and splice sites, as the ability to
interpret the impact of variants outside of those regions is still limited. The high cost of
such testing currently prohibits this as a frontline testing tool. It may be warranted to use
WES for an individual with a diagnosis of FA based on a positive chromosome breakage
test but without causative variants identified on a dedicated FA panel test.
Targeted panels can identify novel variants within known FA genes, but only tests such as
WES or WGS can identify novel FA genes since they screen regions of the genome and
beyond [29]. Additionally, WGS looks at regions within known FA genes that may not be
covered by other methods, such as deep intronic or promoter variants, and, therefore,
could detect novel variants in classic FA genes. While WES and WGS are beneficial for
detecting variants in a larger area of the genome when compared to panel testing, these
methods are not without risks and limitations (See Table 2). Critically, WES/WGS may
identify a greater number of variants of uncertain significance, and may create ethical
dilemmas in the event of findings not related to the patient’s phenotype [29, 34]. These
aspects should be presented to the patient/family in advance. Genetic counselors are
experienced in conducting informed consent conversations and ordering broad
sequencing tests like WES/WGS. They can assist with results interpretation and should be
involved in results discussions with providers and families.
Each assay offers different advantages as well as limitations. Table 2 provides an overview
of the benefits and limitations for dedicated gene panels, WES, and WGS sequencing.

Platform Benefits Risks/Limitations
Dedicated
gene panel
• Clinically available genes
associated with a patient's
phenotype are analyzed in a
single test.
• Certain regions may be
addressed specifically to capture
accurate data of known
variant/mutation hotspots and
sequencing challenges, e.g. ,
FANCD2 pseudogenes.
• Fast turnaround time and lowest
cost option.
• Will not detect larger
deletions/duplications if copy number
analysis is not included. Also will likely
fail to detect variants that are deep
intronic or in the promoter of a gene.
• Variants of uncertain significance may
be identified.
• Incidental discovery of a hereditary
cancer risk in the family not associated
with the underlying FA diagnosis is
possible.
Whole
exome
sequencing
(WES)
• All coding regions (exons) of the
genome are sequenced in a
single test.
• May provide value for patients
not identified with causative
variants by dedicated panel
testing (may provide opportunity
for gene discovery through
research).
• WES can provide information for
conditions other than FA if
diagnosis is uncertain and if
those conditions have specific
clinical management.
• Cannot detect larger
deletions/duplications or structural
changes like translocations and
inversions, distinguish pseudogene
regions, or detect deep intron ic
variants. Overall coverage is poorer,
and some exons are not analyzed
effectively.
• May uncover findings not related to
patient's diagnosis, with potential for
greater number of uncertain variants
than panel testing.
• More expensive than panel testing and
slow turnaround time.
Whole
genome
sequencing
(WGS)
• All coding and non-coding
regions (exons and introns) of the
genome are sequenced in a
single test.
• May provide value for patients
not identified with causative
variants by dedicated panel
testing or WES (may provide
opportunity for gene discovery
through research).
• WGS can provide information for
conditions other than FA if
diagnosis is uncertain and if
those conditions have specific
clinical management.
• Standards of what will define a clinical
genome are still emerging. Assay cost,
turnaround time and variant
interpretation are still subject to further
refinement to be clinically relevant.

Special Considerations with Genetic Testing
Genetic Discrimination
Fear of discrimination is a common concern for patients when considering genetic testing.
Genetic discrimination occurs when people are treated differently because they have a

## Page 34

32
genetic variant that increases the risk of an inherited condition. The Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is a U.S. federal law designed to protect people from health
insurance and employment discrimination. The GINA does not protect against this
discrimination with other forms of insurance such as life, disability, or long-term care
insurance.
Variant Interpretation
A major challenge in the interpretation of genetic testing is the identification of variants of
unknown significance (VUS). A VUS is a DNA alteration with an uncertain relationship to
disease. Although healthy variation in the human genome is expected, the more of an
individual’s genome that is analyzed, the more likely it is to find sequence alterations that
are novel and difficult to interpret. The American College of Medical Genetics and
Genomics (ACMG) has recommended that a standard classification system be used to
create a common language for clinical variant interpretation [35]. Based on specific
criteria, a sequence change may be characterized in terms of its relationship to disease as
one of the following: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, likely benign or benign. While
pathogenic and likely pathogenic results are often sufficient to provide a genetic
diagnosis, VUS findings should be interpreted with caution. Families should be encouraged
to stay in contact with their genetics team annually for updates on the interpretation of
their specific variant(s) and enter research studies that can assess pathogenicity.
Variant Confirmation
Although sequencing platforms can detect the presence of genomic variants, they may or
may not detect “phase.” Phase refers to the positioning of variants affecting the same
gene. In cis variants are located together on the same copy of a given gene; in trans
variants are situated on opposite copies of the same gene. Thus, to confirm a diagnosis of
autosomal recessive FA, parental testing should be offered to confirm that the variants are
positioned in trans.
Secondary Findings
As the number of genes in the analysis increases, so does the potential to identify
additional findings that may or may not be related to the goal of testing. In addition to
identifying the underlying genetic cause of an individual’s FA, larger panels, WES, and WGS
also may reveal a variant in a gene linked to other health risks. In this scenario, the
unanticipated variant is called a secondary finding. For example, testing may detect two
FANCA gene variants that explain the patient’s FA phenotype, and also identify a single
pathogenic BRCA2 variant associated with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer
Syndrome. Patients (and/or their parents or guardians in the case of children) should be
told of this potential in advance. In the case of WES and WGS, the ACMG has compiled a
specific list of genes for which reporting of secondary findings is recommended [36]. As a
critical component toward the acknowledgement of a patient’s right “not to know,” it is

## Page 35

33
important to review the opportunity to opt out of receipt of secondary findings during an
informed consent discussion for WES and WGS.
Negative Molecular Test Results
Negative molecular test results should be carefully interpreted for an individual with a
chromosome breakage test within the FA range. One explanation for a negative result is
the presence of a variant(s) in an undiscovered FANC gene or a type of variant in a gene
that cannot be identified with current technology; another possibility is somatic mosaicism
[37, 38]. Analysis of an alternative sample type (such as fibroblasts) may be considered in
individuals presenting with an FA phenotype and negative genetic studies on peripheral
blood.

Bone Marrow Analysis for Somatic Genetic
Variation
Chromosome G-Banding Analysis
Following the diagnosis of FA, a cytogenetic study of the chromosomes of the patient’s
bone marrow cells should be analyzed using standard G-banding methodology. The goals
of such studies are to investigate for the presence of a clone with acquired chromosome
abnormalities and, if present, to characterize the observed abnormalities. The
identification of a clone, which by definition involves the presence of the same numerical
and/or structural chromosomal abnormalities in multiple cells, is an indication of an
abnormal hematologic process. The significance of the cytogenetic findings must be
interpreted within the context of the clinical findings, bone marrow morphologic findings
from hematopathology examination, and immunophenotyping. It also is important to note
that the cells of patients with FA demonstrate chromosomal instability and it is likely that
some cells will develop random, non-clonal abnormalities. The clinical laboratory
performing the chromosome analysis should have expertise in cancer cytogenetics, be
familiar with FA and the types of abnormalities associated with the disorder, and be able
to distinguish non-clonal abnormalities (which are limited to single cells and do not
represent an emerging malignant process) from clonal abnormalities (which can herald
the development of a premalignant or malignant condition).
Clonal Abnormalities
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and other hematologic
malignancies are associated with clonal abnormalities; therefore, the observation of a
clonal abnormality may herald the emergence of neoplasms or of a precancerous
condition. Some clonal abnormalities in patients with FA may persist for a long time

## Page 36

34
without causing adverse consequences; others have been recognized as being associated
with more rapid progression or more aggressive disease. In either case, clonal evolution
and clonal expansion are frequently associated with disease progression. If no clonal
abnormalities are observed in the patient’s bone marrow, then the G-banding analysis
should be repeated annually. If an abnormal clone is observed, then follow-up analyses
should be performed more than once per year to monitor the behavior of the clone and
evaluate for evolution or expansion. To fully interpret the results of the bone marrow
chromosome analysis, a hematopathologist should provide morphologic evaluation and
flow cytometry and immunophenotyping should be used to provide additional
characterization of the abnormal cells.
Recurring clonal chromosome abnormalities may be found in patients with MDS, AML, and
other cancers (see Chapter 3). Certain chromosomal abnormalities occur more frequently
in patients with FA, including a gain of material from the long arm of chromosome 1 (1qG),
gain of material from the long arm of chromosome 3 (3qG), and loss of chromosome 7 (7L).
These abnormalities can occur alone or in combination with each other, or with other
abnormalities involving other chromosomes [39-43]. One study found that gains of the
long arms of chromosomes 1 and 3, and loss of chromosome 7 accounted for 75% of the
clonal abnormalities observed in patients with FA [39]. The finding of the 3q gain, in
particular, is specific to FA, and frequently is associated with cytogenetic evolution that
includes monosomy 7 and leads to MDS. In fact, discovery of a 3q gain in a patient with
apparent de novo MDS or AML should trigger the recommendation of breakage analysis.
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
Because a given clonal abnormality, such as the gain of the long arm of chromosome 3, is
often embedded within a more complex structural abnormality (for example, a very small
amount of material from 3q may be translocated to another chromosome), it may be
difficult to accurately characterize using G-banding alone. In such cases, fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH), which employs fluorescently labeled chromosome region or gene
-specific probes, can be a highly informative addition to G-banded chromosome analysis.
Other subtle abnormalities may be completely overlooked without the use of FISH. While
G-banding examines all chromosomes for abnormalities, FISH analysis typically examines
cells for a small set of pre-specified abnormalities. Furthermore, G-banding is limited to
the dividing cells and is rather labor intensive, which limits the overall number of cells
analyzed. FISH analysis, on the other hand, can be used to quickly examine more than 100
cells. Thus, the two techniques of G-banding and FISH complement each other. Because
the gain of 1q (1qG) and/or 3q (3qG), and loss of 7 (7L) comprise the majority of the clonal
abnormalities seen in cells from patients with FA, it is recommended that, in addition to
the G-band analysis of 20 metaphase cells, FISH analysis of 100 to 200 interphase cells be
performed to detect low-level presence of a clone harboring one of these three
abnormalities. Some laboratories use FISH analysis for a larger number of regions involved

## Page 37

35
in MDS and AML (e.g., 5q, 20q) in both FA and non-FA patients. Such FISH panels can be
applied to either unstimulated peripheral blood or to bone marrow. The concordance
between FISH results on blood and bone marrow in patients with FA has not yet been
clearly established; however, some physicians and laboratories have started to perform
FISH analyses on peripheral blood samples that are collected at time points in between
the annual scheduled bone marrow testing. This intervening blood FISH study is being
tested as a noninvasive means of monitoring, on a more frequent basis, for the emergence
of an abnormal clone with 1qG, 3qG, or 7L.
Genomic Microarray Testing
Genomic microarray testing is a relatively recent technique that has become a major tool
for cytogenetics and/or molecular laboratories. Microarray techniques such as array
comparative hybridization and/or single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis can identify
regions of chromosomal loss and/or gain that may be too small, too ambiguous in banding
pattern, or too complex to be identified by conventional chromosomal banding
techniques. Sometimes there are so many abnormalities in a single cell, that a specific
abnormality is essentially hidden. Microarray techniques are highly sensitive for detecting
and identifying the origin of regions of chromosome loss and gain. For example,
microarray techniques can rapidly detect and characterize the presence of a 3qG
abnormality and provide specific information about the boundaries of the region that is
gained. However, one limitation of this technique is that the clonal abnormality must be
present in a sufficiently high percentage of cells (generally higher than 10%) to be
detected. Unlike FISH and conventional G-banding analyses, microarray analysis does not
provide information about individual cells, but rather provides results based on the total
population of cells sampled. However, given the now wide availability of microarray
testing, in the case of a complex bone marrow chromosome result, microarray analysis is
recommended.

Genotype/Phenotype Associations in
Fanconi Anemia
Fanconi anemia is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. In some cases,
knowing the gene and specific variant(s) can be a critical component of identifying
potential risk and attempting to understand clinical course. Medical management for most
individuals with FA will be in accordance with their clinical presentation. However, for
individuals with variants in genes that have altered phenotypes, genotype identification is
essential for proper medical management and for prognostic purposes, particularly as
genes with FA-like phenotypes may exclude classic FA symptoms. It is important to
recognize that genotype/phenotype information often is based on a limited number of

## Page 38

36
cases and that outliers to the traditional phenotype have been observed. Several FA
variants for which sufficient information is available is included below.
FANCA
One study reported that individuals with homozygous null variants in the FANCA gene
develop anemia at an earlier age, and have a higher incidence of leukemia than
individuals with residual function FANCA variants [44]. However, a separate analysis
revealed that the age of onset of anemia and incidence of leukemia was not altered in
patients with homozygous null FANCA variants or in patients who express an abnormal
form of the protein [45]. Specific variants may help predict phenotype such as the
p.His913Pro and p.Arg951Gln/Trp variants that have been reported in association with a
later onset of disease and slow hematologic progression [46].
FANCB
Males with a truncating variant in the FANCB gene frequently present with overt findings
consistent with VACTERL-H [47], although a milder phenotype has been reported for
patients with missense variants or somatic mosaicism [48, 49]. Female FANCB carriers do
not appear to have associated disease findings [50].
FANCC
The International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR) noted that individuals with variants in
FANCC had an earlier age of onset of bone marrow failure and poorer survival compared
to individuals with variants in FANCA or FANCG [51]. This finding was not reported by the
European FA Research Group, which described the least severe hematologic course and
fewer somatic abnormalities in the FANCC group when compared to FANCA and FANCG
[44]. Multiple variants in the FANCC gene have been associated with specific phenotypes.
Variants located in a region of the gene known as exon 15 (historically exon 14) have been
reported in association with the development of blood abnormalities at an earlier age,
more congenital abnormalities and poorer survival compared with individuals who have
variants in exon 2 (historically exon 1) [51, 52]. The variant c.456+4A>T (formerly known as
IVS4+4A>T) also was reported in association with a more severe disease presentation in
Ashkenazi Jewish individuals [52, 53]. However, this variant has been reported in other
populations [54, 55] and may not be associated with a severe phenotype in certain groups
[56]. Several studies suggest that the c.67delG founder variant (formerly known as
322delG) is associated with milder symptoms, but exceptions have been observed [52, 53,
57]. A study in the Saudi population reported that the founder variant c.165+1G>T also may
be associated with a mild form of the disease [58].

## Page 39

37
FANCD1/BRCA2
A study published in 2002 reported that individuals with FA and pathogenic biallelic
variants of the BRCA2 gene may develop leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), at a much earlier age than expected [59]. They also are at
risk of developing solid tumors of the brain (e.g., medulloblastoma, glioblastoma
multiforme, astrocytoma) and kidney (e.g., Wilms tumor), which are not commonly seen in
FA [60, 61]. If a patient has biallelic FANCD1/BRCA2 variants, additional screening with
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and kidney ultrasound should be considered [62].
While some studies in this population have demonstrated a severe phenotype, including
multiple congenital abnormalities and a 97% risk of developing any malignancy by 5.2
years of age [60], there is a report of older individuals with milder or later onset disease
[63, 64].
FANCG
The European FA Research Group reported that individuals with pathogenic variants in
FANCG had more severe cytopenia and a higher incidence of leukemia than patients with
variants in other FA genes [44], but this pattern was not observed in the data set collected
by IFAR [51].
FANCM
Overall, more information is needed to better understand the FANCM phenotype. FANCM
was proposed in 2005 to operate as an FA core complex gene and associated with an FA
phenotype in a family with affected siblings [65]. Biallelic FANCA variants were later
identified in the affected siblings, raising the question of FANCM as a canonical FA gene
[66]. Biallelic loss of function FANCM variants have since been identified in individuals
diagnosed with FA, and some authors suggest an alternate phenotype associated with an
early-onset cancer syndrome rather than a classical FA phenotype, as their cohorts lacked
bone marrow failure and congenital anomalies [67, 68]. In 2014 it was reported that a
patient with compound heterozygous FANCM variants exhibited chromosome fragility,
thumb and thenar eminence anomalies of the right hand, and bone marrow failure [69].
Reports of early-onset breast cancer and reduced fertility (primary ovarian insufficiency
and mild to severe spermatogenesis in two families) in presumed biallelic carriers without
an overt phenotype also have been published [68, 70, 71]. See section on cancer risk for
carriers in this chapter.
FANCN/PALB2
Variants in the FANCN/PALB2 gene typically are associated with a more severe clinical
presentation. Similar to the FANCD1/BRCA2 phenotype, individuals with variants in
FANCN/PALB2 develop solid tumors and leukemia at an earlier age than patients with
variants in other FA genes [72]. Commonly reported tumors include medulloblastoma,

## Page 40

38
Wilms tumor, AML, and neuroblastoma [72-74]. The cancer surveillance recommendations
for patients with biallelic FANCD1/BRCA2 variants also may be considered for individuals
with FANCN/PALB2 variants in the absence of consensus guidelines. Phenotypes outside of
this spectrum have been reported [75] indicating that additional cases over time may
further expand the phenotypic spectrum of FANCN/PALB2-associated FA.
FANCO/RAD51C
Two families with an FA-like disorder and biallelic variants in FANCO/RAD51C have been
reported [76, 77]. In both families, the affected individuals presented with significant
congenital anomalies, including some that are atypical in classical FA such as palate
anomalies, holoprosencephaly, and overlapping fingers. Hypersensitivity to diepoxybutane
(DEB) and mitomycin C (MMC) and increased radial breaks confirmed the diagnoses of FA.
The risk of hematologic features and squamous cell tumors remains unknown.
FANCR/RAD51
While the majority of genes associated with FA require a pathogenic variant on both
copies of an FA gene, only a single pathogenic variant in the FANCR/RAD51 gene is needed
to cause disease. In the two reported cases, the FANCR/RAD51 variant appears to have
been de novo in the proband, resulting in an FA-like phenotype that includes congenital
abnormalities but has not been associated with hematologic disease or cancers thus far
[78, 79].
FANCS/BRCA1
The first confirmed case of biallelic FANCS/BRCA1 variants was reported in a 28-year-old
woman with stage IV papillary serous ovarian carcinoma and severe toxicity to cisplatin
treatment, although diagnosis was not confirmed by chromosome breakage analysis [80].
A second case of a 23-year-old woman with ductal breast carcinoma was confirmed to
have FA through chromosome breakage studies [81]. Both individuals presented with short
stature, microcephaly, dysmorphology, and some degree of intellectual or developmental
disability. A recent publication reported two families with four children having
chromosome breakage studies consistent with FA, as well as homozygous truncating
BRCA1 variants. All four children had congenital abnormalities and growth deficiency; one
child developed T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia at 5 years and a second child
developed neuroblastoma at 2 years. The remaining two children were cancer-free at 5
years and 15.5 years of age [82]. Another case confirmed by chromosome breakage was of
a 2.5-year-old female with short stature, microcephaly, neurodevelopmental delay and
dysmorphology but without a history of cancer [83]. None of the reported cases have
developed bone marrow failure.

## Page 41

39
FANCQ/ERCC4
In addition to the FA phenotype, biallelic variants in FANCQ/ERCC4 have been linked to
autosomal recessive Cockayne syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum, and a single case of
XFE progeroid syndrome. Affected individuals can present with a single phenotype or
concomitant phenotypes, depending on how gene function is impacted [84-87].
FANCR/RAD51
Monoallelic variants in FANCR/RAD51 have been reported with autosomal dominant
congenital mirror movements (CMM) [88, 89]. To date, FA and CMM phenotypes have not
been reported in the same individual.

Additional Genetic Counseling Considerations
The decision to proceed with any type of genetic analysis should be at the discretion of the
patient or guardian. Genetic testing has benefits, risks, and limitations, which should be
reviewed in advance so that an informed decision about testing can be made. The complex
challenges of genetic testing necessitate a detailed conversation with a genetic counselor
as misdiagnosis or misinterpretation of test results can have a significant impact on the
individual and his or her family members. Patients should be counseled by an experienced
genetic counselor at the time of diagnosis and at various points throughout their lives. A
genetic consultation should include discussions of the following:
• The genetic testing process
• Family, medical, and pregnancy histories
• Inheritance of FA
• Reproductive options for the patients, parents, and relatives
• Research opportunities
• Community support and resources
Inheritance of FA
Fanconi anemia is predominantly inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, meaning
that affected individuals harbor a disease-causing variant in both copies of the same FA
gene. However, etiology for a small fraction of affected individuals is due to a single
disease-causing variant in either the FANCB or FANCR gene. FANCB is inherited in an X-
linked recessive pattern, meaning males with a single pathogenic variant in the FANCB
gene have FA. FANCR/RAD51 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern meaning both
males and females with a single pathogenic variant in FANCR would be expected to have
FA. The importance of the different forms of inheritance on recurrence risk is described in
the section on “Genetic Testing of Family Members.”

## Page 42

40
Family History
A genetic counselor or family member should collect a three-generation family history.
Family history can be helpful in identifying other family members with FA-related clinical
features and in determining inheritance pattern. Ancestry and any family history of cancer
should be noted since some FA genes have carrier cancer risks. In the event that patterns
or clues are identified, testing may be targeted to a single gene or small number of genes
of interest.
Ancestry
Most disease-causing variants occur regardless of ancestral background. However, in
certain groups, some variants, referred to as “founder mutations,” are carried at an
increased frequency. Founder variant information can be useful for a few reasons:
Phenotype Predictions:
• For example, the FANCC variant (c.67delG) that is common in Northern Europeans [52]
and the FANCA variant (p.His913Pro) that appears to be common in the Sicilian
population [46] are typically associated with a milder FA phenotype. Alternatively, the
c.456+4A>T variant in the FANCC gene is associated with a severe phenotype in the
Ashkenazi Jewish population [53], while this phenotypic severity is not necessarily
seen in affected individuals within the Japanese population [56].
Carrier Frequency Predictions:
• While the carrier frequency in the United States general population is predicted to be
approximately 1:181 based on the reported incidence of FA, the carrier frequency for
FA is higher in certain populations such as Spanish Gypsies, Afrikaners, and Ashkenazi
Jews due to known founder events [1]. This information is important for appropriate
reproductive counseling for individuals with a personal or family history of FA when
his/her partner’s ethnic background increases their risk for being a carrier of FA.
Targeted Genetic Testing:
• Historically, founder variant information could be utilized in some cases as a first tier,
more targeted genetic test.

Genetic Testing for Family Members
Once an individual’s genotype is known, family members can then undergo “targeted”
analysis (also called carrier or single-site testing) to determine their carrier status and
inform family planning. When possible, efforts should be made to first test the affected
individual. However, if the proband is unavailable for dedicated FA testing, panel testing

## Page 43

41
on relatives to identify their carrier status is a reasonable approach. In this case, results
interpretation may be complicated by variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and
negative test results for an unaffected relative should be interpreted with caution.
Owing to the clinical variability of FA (even within the same family), all biological siblings
of an affected person should undergo a chromosome breakage test. This is particularly
important in the setting of transplant where a family member is identified as a potential
donor. Pending the breakage study outcome, additional testing may be considered.
Subsequent testing options are listed in the diagnostic testing section of this chapter.
As described earlier, most forms of FA follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
Two forms deviate from this with one following X-linked inheritance (FANCB) and the
other displaying autosomal dominance (FANCR/RAD51).
Autosomal Recessive Inheritance
Autosomal recessive inheritance means that an individual must have two copies of a non-
working gene to have symptoms of the condition. Biological parents of an affected child
should be offered carrier testing. Doing so confirms that each parent carries one of the
known variants and proves the variants are in trans (on separate gene copies). Each child
from parents who are confirmed carriers has a 25% chance of having FA. Unaffected
siblings (following negative chromosome breakage studies) have a 67% chance of being an
FA carrier. Although rare, it is possible that a parent tests negative. Explanations for this
include:
• The egg or sperm involved in the child’s conception developed a spontaneous change
(known as a de novo variant)
• Only a fraction of the parent’s reproductive cells has the variant (known as germline
or gonadal mosaicism)
• Uniparental disomy (UPD) in which one variant is present on both gene copies and
was inherited from only one parent (thus far only reported in FANCA and FANCP
cases) [90]
• Misattributed parentage (the child was adopted, was the product of a donor egg or
sperm, paternity or maternity was not accurately reported)

Inheritance also is an important consideration when an individual with FA reaches
reproductive age. While reduced fertility is reported, some individuals with FA have
conceived biological children. The likelihood of having an affected child depends on the
genetic status of a partner. Comprehensive testing that includes full sequencing and
deletion/duplication analysis to identify any pathogenic variant in the causative FANC
gene of the partner will best inform risks to future children. For example, when FA is
attributed to the FANCA gene, comprehensive FANCA analysis is needed for the partner,
rather than targeted testing for the known FANCA variants. Depending on the couple’s
genetic status, pregnancy outcomes are as follows:

## Page 44

42
• If the partner tests negative, the chance to have a child with FA is very low. All
children will be carriers.
• If the partner tests positive in the same FANC gene, there is a 50% chance each child
will have FA, and a 50% chance each child will be a carrier of FA.
• If both partners have FA and have variants in the same FANC gene, all (100%) of their
children will have FA.

Should both partners have FA due to variants in different FANC genes, their children will
be carriers for two different forms of FA. The chance for their children to be affected is
very low, presuming they had negative carrier testing for one another's FA type. Extended
relatives on both sides of the family should be offered carrier testing for the familial FANC
variants.
X-Linked Recessive Inheritance
With an X-linked condition, the disease-causing gene resides on the X chromosome. In FA,
this inheritance applies to the FANCB gene. Women have two X chromosomes while men
have one X and one Y chromosome. If a woman carries the causative variant, there is a
50% chance of passing on the variant in each pregnancy. Any sons who inherit the variant
will be affected. Any daughters who inherit the variant will be carriers. If the mother of an
affected boy has negative carrier testing, her son's FA is likely de novo although germline
mosaicism cannot be excluded. As such, male siblings of an affected male should undergo
chromosome breakage analysis. Maternal relatives in these families have an increased
chance of carrying or having the condition. Any daughters born to affected men will be
obligate carriers. Any sons will be unaffected, since they inherit a Y chromosome from
their fathers.
Autosomal Dominant Inheritance
Autosomal dominant inheritance means that an individual need only one non-working
copy of a gene to have symptoms of the condition. In FA, autosomal dominant inheritance
applies to the FANCR/RAD51 gene. While affected individuals to date are reported with de
novo variants (meaning the condition was not inherited from an affected parent), parents
should still be offered testing. With negative testing, germline/gonadal mosaicism cannot
be excluded. A small chance remains that siblings or a future pregnancy could be affected.
All siblings, therefore, should be assessed by chromosome breakage. Anyone who tests
positive has FA. Any sons or daughters of a person with autosomal dominant FA would
have a 50% chance to have FA, and a 50% chance to be unaffected.
Carrier Cancer Risk
Fanconi anemia and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genes encode proteins that
operate within a common pathway, called the FA DNA repair pathway. These proteins

function together to maintain genome integrity by repairing DNA damage (see Chapter 1)
[91]. Variable cancer risks already have been linked to altered protein function of FA
genes; however, it is critical for providers and families to understand how information
about cancer risk in carriers is evolving and the association of rare variants with cancer
susceptibility [92]. In fact, many FA genes are included in large clinical panel tests despite
insufficient data to adequately define their cancer risks [93-95]. Currently, for genes listed
in Table 3, there are management recommendations published by the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for individuals with positive test results, also
known as pathogenic or likely pathogenic test results. The NCCN reviews existing
literature annually and provides updated clinical practice guidelines for the detection,
prevention, and risk reduction of adult onset cancers as new information is learned [96].

Outside of the five genes listed in Table 3, question about increased cancer risk in carriers
of the remaining FA and FA-like genes is a topic of great interest and ongoing research.
Over the years, data published from FA families have tried to capture the observed number
of cancers in carriers versus an estimated cancer incidence in the general population.
These studies, limited in scale and to self-reported data collection, did not indicate a
significant difference that would warrant modified management [110-112].
All FA carriers should be encouraged to communicate their genetic status with primary
providers and to reach out annually for potential health and cancer risk updates. It is
equally important to ensure in advance that families are aware of the potential to uncover
health risks affecting carriers, and the potential for discrimination of unaffected
individuals based on positive findings. Referral to a genetic counselor who specializes in
cancer predisposition is recommended for accurate risk assessment and a comprehensive
discussion about testing, management options and family planning.

Reproductive Planning
There are multiple reproductive options for parents of a child with FA and individuals with
FA. Preconception genetic counseling is available for families to discuss these options in
greater detail.
Prenatal Diagnostic Testing
Prenatal diagnostic testing of fetal cells can be done at various times in the pregnancy to
determine whether a fetus has FA. Prenatal testing also can be used to determine whether
the fetus has the same human leukocyte antigens (HLA) as the sibling with FA. This
process, known as HLA typing, reveals whether the child will be a suitable donor for the
sibling with FA. Prenatal testing options include chorionic villus sampling and
amniocentesis, which are typically available from the 10
th and 15th weeks of pregnancy,
respectively. The goal of both procedures is to obtain fetal cells for genetic testing or
chromosomal breakage analysis. Targeted variant analysis should be performed on fetal
DNA if the genetic variants are known, whereas chromosome breakage testing should be
performed when the familial variants are not known. Both procedures are associated with
a risk of miscarriage and should be discussed in detail with the center performing the
procedure.
Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a genetic screen used to test embryos
produced through in vitro fertilization (IVF). While PGD can attempt to select embryos
without FA and those that are an HLA-match for an affected sibling, this technology is not
a guarantee and the individual PGD center should inform families of their experience and
accuracy. Parents considering PGD should be advised of the chances of selecting a healthy,
HLA-matched embryo. Theoretically, for couples who have a child with autosomal
recessive form of FA, there is a 75% chance that an embryo will not have FA, and a 25%
chance that an embryo will be an HLA match, thus the odds that an embryo will be both
unaffected with FA and an HLA match is 18.75% (3/16). Realistically, many couples need
multiple rounds of IVF-PGD to achieve a clinical pregnancy resulting in a birth. Further, it is
recommended that prenatal testing be performed for all pregnancies resulting from
embryos produced through IVF-PGD to confirm the expected genetic status based on PGD.
Other Reproductive Options
Other reproductive options include the use of donor gametes (egg or sperm), adoption,
and unassisted pregnancy. Surrogacy also is an option, especially for women with FA who
are concerned about the health implications of pregnancy.

Summary
Close communication between physicians, genetic counselors,
cytogenetics and molecular genetics laboratories, and
hematopathologists is critical for the diagnosis of FA and the optimal
care for patients with the disease. Early diagnosis of FA and the
characterization of patient-specific FA variants is of utmost
importance as this information may influence a patient’s clinical
management. It is critical that a clinically certified laboratory
perform the diagnostic tests to ensure adherence to rigorous
standards for quality control and quality assurance. All cytogenetic
findings should be interpreted within the context of the patient’s
complete hematological profile and other clinical features to obtain
a comprehensive assessment of the patient’s status. It is strongly
recommended that a genetic counselor or other genetics
professional help guide the testing. Prior to the initiation of testing,
the genetic counselor should confer with the laboratory director
about the limitations of the testing methodology and analysis being
used. Specifically, the genetic counselor and laboratory director
should discuss the types of variants that can and cannot be detected,
and the number of FA genes and other relevant genes that will be
included in the testing. This information should be summarized by
the genetic counselor and communicated to the patient and the
patient’s family.

Chapter 3
Clinical Care of Fanconi
Anemia Hematologic Issues

Introduction
Most patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) commonly develop
hematologic complications that are primarily related to bone
marrow failure (BMF). It is thought that the cause of BMF in patients
with FA is a faulty DNA repair pathway that damages hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) (see Chapter 1). This chapter provides an overview
of hematologic care for patients with FA, including guidelines for
clinical monitoring of patients and the decision process for
determining the need for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), the
only proven curative treatment for BMF. The chapter also outlines
HCT care guidelines and provides a discussion of recent
advancements in HCT protocols that have led to significant
improvements in the survival rates of patients with FA. Alternative
therapeutic options beyond HCT, such as gene therapy, also are
discussed.

## Page 56

Bone Marrow Failure
Bone marrow failure (BMF) in patients with FA can range from mild, asymptomatic
cytopenias to severe aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML). The absence of BMF, however, does not exclude the
diagnosis of FA. More than 90% of patients with FA will have macrocytosis starting in
infancy or childhood. However, macrocytosis may be masked by concomitant iron
deficiency or an inherited blood disorder such as alpha- or beta-thalassemia trait, which
can delay diagnosis of FA [1-3].
Definition of Bone Marrow Failure
Bone marrow failure is diagnosed by blood counts that are below standard age-
appropriate ranges. While many patients progress to frank aplastic anemia, others may
maintain mildly abnormal blood counts for years and even decades. Bone marrow failure
is classified into three broad categories depending upon the degree of cytopenia(s)
observed (see Table 1). The classification defines points at which different clinical
management options should be considered. Importantly, to meet these criteria for BMF,
the cytopenia(s) must be persistent and not transient or secondary to another treatable
cause, such as infection, medication, peripheral blood cell destruction or loss, or
nutritional deficiencies.

<50,000/mm3 <30,000/mm3
Hemoglobin (Hb) level ≥8 g/dL* <8 g/dL <8 g/dL
*Less than normal for age but > 8 g/dL.

Bone Marrow Failure Age of Onset
The age of onset of BMF in patients with FA is highly variable. Three out of every four
patients develop evidence of at least mild BMF within the first decade of life [3-6]. In an
analysis of 754 patients in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR), the average
age of onset was 7.6 years. However, that study analyzed patients who mainly had defects
in the FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG genes; therefore, the results may not be representative

## Page 57

55
of patients with rarer gene defects [5]. In adults, FA is less commonly diagnosed due to
primary BMF; instead, diagnosis of FA more commonly occurs as a consequence of
presentation with cancer or with severe toxicity after chemotherapy treatment for a
malignancy [4-7]. Severe, usually transient, BMF also may develop in non-transplanted
female patients with FA during pregnancy.
The cytopenia that most commonly leads to the diagnosis of FA is thrombocytopenia with
red blood cell macrocytosis and elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin. When a patient is
diagnosed with FA, or when blood counts fall further, a thorough hematologic workup is
necessary to rule out additional causes of cytopenias other than primary BMF. Marrow
cellularity must be interpreted in the context of changes in peripheral blood counts as it
may be variable and subject to sampling variation. Therapeutic intervention should not be
based on bone marrow cellularity alone in the absence of clinically significant peripheral
cytopenias or clear evidence (usually clonal cytogenetic changes) of a myelodysplastic or
malignant process.
Clinical Monitoring of Bone Marrow Failure
Clinical surveillance and therapeutic management are guided by the following:
• Severity of the cytopenia(s)
• Stability or trend of the peripheral blood counts
• Presence or development of morphologic (dysplastic) and cytogenetic bone marrow
abnormalities
• Presence of potentially high-risk genotypes (see Chapter 2)
• Other organ system problems
• Patient’s quality of life
• Preferences of the patient and their family

At diagnosis, a trephine bone marrow biopsy should be performed in FA patients to
evaluate bone marrow cellularity and architecture, and as an aspirate to assess
morphology for dysplastic changes and cytogenetics for abnormalities common to FA and
MDS (see Chapter 2). Subsequently, annual evaluation of the bone marrow, beginning at
age two, allows for serial comparisons of a patient’s marrow, and prompt detection of
bone marrow progression that may suggest consideration of transplantation.
Recommendations for Clinical Monitoring of Bone Marrow Failure
Peripheral blood counts stable at no more than mild BMF range (Table 1) and no clonal
cytogenetic abnormalities present
• For patients with normal blood counts or mild BMF and no cytogenetic clonal marrow
abnormalities, peripheral blood counts and differential white blood cell counts should
be reviewed every 3-4 months.
• Consider a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with cytogenetics annually.

## Page 58

56
Peripheral blood counts stable in the normal to mild BMF range (Table 1) and clonal
cytogenetic abnormalities present
• Blood counts and physical findings should be reviewed every three months for
patients with a cytogenetic clonal marrow abnormality (in the absence of
morphologic MDS) together with normal or mildly low, but stable, blood counts.
• Bone marrow examination should be performed every 3-6 months to evaluate if the
patient’s status is stable or changing.
• Review appropriate plans for hematopoietic cell transplantation.
Peripheral blood counts falling or rising
• Patients with progressively changing blood counts without a clinically apparent
underlying cause (e.g., transient response to an acute infection or suppression
secondary to medication) require immediate evaluation by bone marrow biopsy and
aspirate with cytogenetics.
• Rising peripheral blood counts may be due to either the development of MDS or AML
(requiring discussion of urgent transplantation) or, rarely, reversion of a germ-line
mutation in a stem cell called somatic stem cell mosaicism, which repopulates the
marrow with normal cells (see Chapter 2). Such patients require ongoing close
monitoring, including blood counts every 1-2 months and a bone marrow examination
every 3-6 months.
• Discuss and prepare appropriate plans for HCT intervention as adverse clonal
progression or worsening BMF may evolve rapidly.
Clonal Abnormalities
The bone marrow of patients with FA can exhibit dysplasia, such as nuclear/cytoplasmic
desynchrony, hypolobulated megakaryocytes, and binucleated erythroid cells. These
features are difficult to distinguish from truer forms of MDS and the precise diagnosis
determines the need for and type of treatment. The presence of dysplasia is not
necessarily a harbinger of MDS and AML; therefore, it is important for FA patients to have a
baseline bone marrow examination at diagnosis and regular bone marrow cytogenetic
analyses for follow up. Bone marrow examination (which includes aspiration, biopsy, and
cytogenetic analysis as described in Chapter 2) should be performed by an experienced
hematopathologist at the time of diagnosis and in subsequent serial marrow examination
annually. The purpose of the serial marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis is to
identify clonal evolution to MDS or AML in the context of peripheral blood count changes
or physical exam findings. The results of cytogenetics analyses of patients with FA have
revealed varying types and frequencies of clones. An early analysis from the International
Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR) found that the risk of developing MDS or AML within three
years after the observation of a clone was approximately 1 in 3 (35%), whereas the risk for
patients without a clone was 1 in 30 (3%) [8]. In another cohort, clones were noted to
disappear permanently or reappear in serial marrow evaluations [9].

## Page 59

57
Gain of 1q (1qG) and/or 3q (3qG), and loss of 7 (7L) comprise the majority of the clonal
abnormalities seen in cells from patients with FA [10-13]. The prognostic role of 3qG for
predicting progression to MDS or AML was first reported in 18 patients where the three-
year risk of MDS/AML was 9 in 10 (90%), compared with 1 in 10 (10%) for patients without
aberrations in chromosome 3 [13]. In other studies, the prognostic role of a 3qG has been
more difficult to establish. For example, in a study of 119 patients with FA, 32% had clonal
aberrations and 20 out of 119 had 3qG [14], although the prognostic power of 3qG could
not be evaluated because the chromosome aberration occurred simultaneously with the
diagnosis of MDS [14]. Vundinti et al. showed that 10 patients with FA without 3q
aberrations progressed to MDS or AML and five of these patients developed other clones
[15]. Mehta et al. showed that four of 64 FA patients without MDS and six of 13 with
MDS/AML had 3qG, but there was no significant association identified between 3qG and
risk of MDS/AML [10]. The results from these studies indicate that 3qG is a common
chromosomal abnormality in FA and may be associated with MDS and/or AML, although its
prognostic significance is not entirely clear, particularly when it occurs in isolation and
different cytogenetic methodologies are used for analysis.
Similar to the non-FA population, the appearance of monosomy 7 and most 7q deletions
(7L) is generally associated with a poor prognosis and high risk of developing MDS or AML,
whereas trisomy of 1q has not been convincingly shown to associate with prognosis.
However, longitudinal prospective studies of larger numbers of patients are required to
clarify the prognostic role of specific types of clones and combinations of aberrations.
Physicians must be cautious and assess the latest literature when treating a patient who
has a clone but lacks other abnormalities of blood counts or myelodysplastic changes in
the marrow. Despite the presence of a clone, some patients may have stable
hematopoiesis and possibly a relatively favorable long-term prognosis. Regular marrow
examinations before blood count changes offer the best opportunity to diagnose marrow
progression and time to discuss treatment options. The interpretation of specific
chromosomal abnormalities indicative of clonal progression to MDS and AML is discussed
in detail in Chapter 2. The decision on how to proceed should be made by the patient and
their family in discussion with an FA physician specialist.
Treatment Guidelines for Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome
or Acute Myeloid Leukemia
There is no standard therapy for FA patients with MDS or AML. Treatment options include
HCT with or without prior induction chemotherapy, and phase I/II trials for MDS or AML.
Chemotherapy treatment should be undertaken by centers experienced with FA. Because
chemotherapy may cause severe, prolonged, or even irreversible myelosuppression in
patients with FA, back-up plans for potential stem cell rescue should be considered. If
patients have MDS or AML at the time of their diagnosis with FA, then low-intensity
chemotherapy may be used to prepare the patients for transplantation. Published reports

## Page 60

58
of chemotherapy regimens for AML in patients with FA are sparse and limited by the lack
of longitudinal follow-up. It remains unclear whether chemotherapy prior to transplant
improves or worsens outcomes [16].

Treatment Options for Bone Marrow Failure
Transfusions
The onset of anemia in patients with FA is insidious. Hemoglobin levels should be
monitored closely, at least every 3-4 months from diagnosis, so that treatment may be
instituted before transfusion with packed red blood cells is required. Treatment of anemia
should be considered when the patient’s hemoglobin level consistently falls below 8 g/dL
or the patient has other heart or lung disease that requires a higher hemoglobin.
Transfusion use should be minimized particularly if the treatment goal is HCT.
All FA patients should receive red blood cells that have been filtered to deplete leukocytes
to reduce the risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Some centers only use red blood
cells that are CMV-negative, whereas most accept leukocyte depletion as an equally
effective alternative to CMV-negative products. Irradiated blood products should be used
to avoid transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), particularly if transplant
is being considered. Extended antigen matching of transfused red blood cells may be
important for patients in certain racial groups for whom minor antigen mismatch is more
commonly encountered. Patients should not receive blood transfusions from related
family members due to the risk of developing alloimmunization that would increase the
risk of graft rejection after HCT. Blood from unrelated designated donors offers no
increase in transfusion safety and may delay needed transfusion.
Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
The only curative option for bone marrow failure (BMF) in patients with FA is a
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Survival outcomes following HCT have improved
significantly for patients with FA primarily due to earlier referral for HCT prior to the onset
of MDS and/or AML, refinements in treatment plans and HLA-matching between the
patient and donor, and better supportive care before, during, and after HCT.
Recent Advancements in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
From the institutional and registry studies performed to date, six recent developments
have occurred:
• Survival rates after HCT continue to improve, particularly for patients undergoing
alternate donor transplant.
• Transplant from related and unrelated donors has similar outcomes.

## Page 61

59
• Transplant without radiation can be successful for patients with FA.
• Radiation during transplant is clearly associated with increased risk of later cancer in
larger series of persons without FA. More studies are needed to determine if radiation
or a radiation-free conditioning protocol increases the risk of cancer in patients with
FA.
• For patients without a 10/10 or 9/10 matched related donor, 10/10 or 9/10 matched
adult unrelated donor and 10-8/10 (or perhaps less) matched umbilical cord blood
(UCB) are associated with good outcomes.
• Haploidentical transplant can be successful in FA patients with no other donor option.
• In transplanted FA patients, development of chronic or acute GvHD increases the risk
of later cancer.
Sibling Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
In the past, limited field total body irradiation (TBI) was given to FA patients with a human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor; however, today with the use of
fludarabine (FLU) conditioning containing regimens, TBI is used much less often for FA
patients with BMF who have HLA-matched sibling donors [17]. Bonfim et al. reported that
85 patients with FA (median age 9 years, range 3-34 years) and a matched sibling donor
have been transplanted using a radiation-free regimen [18]. The treatment consisted of
cyclophosphamide (CY) (15 mg/kg x 4 days; 60 mg/kg total dose) along with methotrexate
(MTX) and cyclosporine (CSA) immunosuppression to prevent GvHD. The five-year survival
rate for all patients was approximately 85%, and 96% among the 48 patients who were
younger than 10 years at the time of HCT.
T-Cell Depletion Reduces Risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease
The Minnesota group reported that T-cell depletion of bone marrow in sibling donors
reduced the risk of GvHD [19]. In this report, patients were conditioned with CY (5 mg/kg x
4 days; 20 mg/kg total dose), FLU (35 mg/m
2
 x 5 days; 175 mg/m2 total dose), and anti-
thymocyte globulin (ATG) (30 mg/kg x 5 days; 150 mg/kg total dose) followed by the
infusion of T-cell-depleted marrow with CSA and either methylprednisolone or
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to prevent GvHD. Of the 23 patients (median age 8.5 years;
ranging from 3.2-43.3 years) included in the study, 92% survived at least five years [19].
These results indicate that when possible, T-cell depletion should be used to reduce the
risk of GvHD.

Unrelated Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
The majority of FA patients do not have an HLA-identical unaffected sibling donor, so
alternative types of donors must be explored. The two most common donor types are adult
volunteers registered with organizations like the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)
and unrelated cord blood (UCB) obtained from the placenta after the birth of a baby.

## Page 62

60
Recently, the use of haploidentical donors also has been explored as an alternative donor
source.
Outcomes of HCT were reported by the Minnesota group on 48 patients with FA (ranging
from 1.7-34.3 years) with aplastic anemia or MDS who received FLU, CY, ATG, and low-dose
TBI (300 cGy) followed by T-cell-depleted 7-8/8 HLA-matched bone marrow (32 patients)
or by HLA-mismatched UCB (16 patients) if an unrelated donor was unavailable [20]. In this
study, recipients of bone marrow engrafted at a median of 11 days (ranging from 9-23
days); in contrast, only 88% of cord blood recipients engrafted at a median of 19 days
(ranging from 10-40 days). Incidence of acute and chronic GvHD was low (12% and 6%,
respectively), with similar outcomes in patients transplanted with bone marrow and UCB.
The overall survival for the entire cohort was 78% at a median of 2.9 years (ranging from
0.6-6.3 years). However, patients without a prior history of opportunistic infection or
transfusions had a 92% chance of survival at five years [20].
In 2017, the Cincinnati group reported results of a multi-institutional study in which a
radiation-free conditioning regimen was tested, replacing TBI with busulfan (BU) for
patients undergoing alternative donor HCT, including haploidentical transplants. Forty-five
patients (median age 8.2 years, range 4.3-44 years), with aplastic anemia and/or MDS,
received FLU, CY, and ATG in combination with BU followed by transplantation of T-cell-
depleted peripheral blood stem cells. All but one patient engrafted at a median of nine
days (range 7-15). The incidence of acute GvHD was low at 7%. Three patients developed
limited chronic GvHD and none developed extensive chronic GvHD. The median follow-up
time was 41 months and three-year overall survival was 80%. All 19 patients younger than
10 years of age who were transplanted for severe marrow failure and with lower dose BU
survived [21]. This group of investigators is now testing a risk-adjusted approach to the use
of radiation-free transplant by giving lower doses of BU to those with aplasia and higher
doses to those with MDS or AML.
The costs of unrelated donor and cord blood HCT are prohibitive in many countries;
therefore, the use of haploidentical donors has been explored as an alternative donor
option. Outcomes have improved dramatically for alternative donor HCT with the use of
post-HCT (PT) cyclophosphamide (CY) for GvHD prophylaxis, a strategy that raises specific
challenges in CY-sensitive FA patients. In 2017, Bonfim et al. reported on the results of this
approach in 30 patients with FA after a preparative regimen of FLU, TBI (200-300 cGy), and
CY with or without ATG [22]. All patients received PT-CY (25 mg/kg/d x 2 doses) followed
by CSA and MMF. All patients engrafted in the subgroup of patients who did not receive
ATG (n = 14), but their HCT course was complicated by high rates of acute and chronic
GvHD, and only 8 patients survived at time of reporting. In the subgroup that received ATG
(n = 16), 14 patients had sustained engraftment, severe GvHD rates were lower, and 13
patients are alive. One-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 73%. These data
demonstrate that haploidentical donor transplantation with PT-CY is feasible for FA
patients without a matched related or unrelated donor; however, haploidentical

## Page 63

61
transplants still offer challenges [22] and should be considered in patients with FA only if
there are no other alternatives.
In 2018, the Minnesota group compared outcomes of HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD)
HCT (n = 17) and alternative donor HCT (n = 57) performed in patients with FA who had
severe aplastic anemia between 2001 and 2016 [23]. Overall survival at five years was 94%
for MSD-HCT versus 86% for alternative donor-HCT; neutrophil engraftment was 100%
versus 95%, and platelet recovery was 100% versus 89%. Acute GvHD was 6% versus 12%,
severe acute GvHD was 6% versus 4%, and chronic GvHD was 0% versus 7%, with no
statistically significant differences noted by the type of transplant. These data
demonstrate that alternative donor-HCT should be considered when a patient is close to
transfusion-dependence, similar to timing for MSD-HCT, in patients with FA-associated
BMF.
Indications for Sibling and/or Alternative Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
The eligibility criteria to consider for sibling or alternative donor HCT is as follows:
• Aplastic anemia (hemoglobin (Hgb) < 8 g/dL or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <
500/µL or platelet count < 20,000/µL)
• MDS or AML
• Progressive complex cytogenetic abnormalities known to be associated with
malignancy
• Absence of active infections
• Available donor
Order of priority
• HLA 10/10 (followed by 9/10) allele-matched sibling
• HLA 10/10 (followed by 9/10) allele-matched relative other than sibling
• HLA 10/10 (followed by 9/10) allele-matched unrelated adult volunteer
• HLA 10-8/10 antigen matched UCB
Indications for Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
With similar outcomes, the indications for alternate donor HCT are the same as the
indications for sibling donor HCT. Patients with an exceptional risk of HCT-related
mortality (e.g., patients with severe organ dysfunction, those who are 35 years or older, and
those with pre-existing malignancies or life-threatening systemic infections) may consider
alternative treatment options first, such as the use of androgens.
Patients with FA who develop persistent and severe cytopenias or evidence of MDS or AML
should be considered for HCT provided the patient is not too old and has adequate organ
function. Clinical investigation is underway to determine whether HCT performed earlier
may be considered for patients with specific genetic mutations who are deemed to be at
particularly high risk for rapid progression to MDS or AML, and who may face markedly
shortened survival times (e.g., BRCA-related genetic mutations) [24].

## Page 64

62
Graft-Versus-Host Disease
Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) occurs when the transplanted immune system of the
donor recognizes the patient as “foreign” and tries to reject the foreign tissues. This
disease sometimes occurs after HCT because the donor’s immune system is transplanted
along with the donor’s hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which are responsible for marrow
recovery and reconstitution of the blood cells. While GvHD can occur in any patient
undergoing an allogeneic HCT, the disease tends to be more common and severe in
mismatched donor recipients. The signs and symptoms of the two types of GvHD (acute
and chronic) are detailed in Table 2. Graft-versus-host disease can occur regardless of the
prophylactic approach used. The more severe the GvHD (e.g., grade 3-4 disease), the
higher the risk of death, mostly due to infection. If GvHD occurs, the typical first line
treatment is a steroid (methylprednisolone).

Infections
Infection following HCT can be a major complication for FA patients due to their unique
sensitivity to chemoradiotherapy and, in some cases, the extensive period of neutropenia
prior to HCT for some patients. Prophylactic antibiotic regimens are commonly used after
HCT to reduce the risk of infection. Most patients are treated with
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) for one year after transplant and other
antibacterial and antifungal drugs through at least day 100 after HCT. The length of
prophylactic therapy to prevent infection depends upon the degree of
immunosuppression, the patient’s absolute CD4 T-cell level, the development of acute or
chronic GvHD, and the patient’s prior history of infectious complications.

## Page 65

Long-Term Follow-Up Care for Hematopoietic Cell
Transplant
Long-term follow-up after HCT for patients with FA must be thought of as an indispensable
part of routine medical care. Guidelines for the long-term care of survivors of childhood
cancer have been developed by the Children’s Oncology Group [25]. In addition, the
American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the European Group for Blood
and Marrow Transplantation, and the Center for International Blood and Marrow
Transplant Research recently developed joint recommendations [26] which include
suggested screening and preventive practices for adult survivors of HCT. Many of these
recommendations also apply to patients with FA who have undergone HCT.
All patients treated with HCT, including those with FA, are subject to health complications
known as “late effects” that may develop long after the transplant. These effects include
late graft failure, recurrent acute and chronic GvHD, and the effects of prolonged steroid
therapy such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and aseptic necrosis of bone (loss of bone
primarily in the hip, knee, and shoulder joints). Other HCT late effects such as short stature
and sterility have not been formally evaluated in patients with FA since these are pre-
existing problems in most FA patients. Late effects of transplant can negatively impact the
patient’s physical and mental health, quality of life, growth, development, education, and
employment (Table 3). Therefore, the development of late effects must be assessed on an
ongoing basis [27-36].

Practical Considerations for Long-Term Follow-Up Care
General guidelines for long-term follow-up of FA patients starting at one year post-HCT is
outlined in Table 4 [27, 37-39]. Long-term care plans should be tailored to the specific
needs of each individual FA patient under the supervision of a long-term care team
comprised of the HCT physician, primary hematologist, and a multi-disciplinary team of
specialists.

Alternative Treatments for Bone Marrow Failure
If blood counts decline to severe levels (Table 1) and cure by HCT is not possible or
preferred, alternative therapies may maintain blood counts and quality of life in patients
with FA.
Androgens
Synthetic androgens, such as oxymetholone and danazol, have been used to treat
cytopenias in patients with FA for more than 50 years. Androgens primarily affect red cells
and platelets but can also improve neutrophil counts [40, 41]. More than half of patients
with FA who are treated with androgens will respond at least transiently, although a
subset of patients who initially respond may become refractory over time. As many as 10-
20% of patients who receive continuous low dose androgen therapy may never require an
HCT, unless MDS and/or AML develop. Thus, androgen treatment may delay a transplant
for months and even years in responsive patients [42].
Androgen treatment used to delay HCT may be associated with the following risks and
complications:
• Androgens do not prevent progression to MDS/AML
• Androgens may increase the chance of liver or other problems, which may complicate
HCT
• Use of androgens may increase the age at which patients with FA undergo HCT
• Patients may have acquired viral infections, which may be problematic during HCT

Patients prescribed androgens should be prospectively monitored for liver function test
(LFT) abnormalities and development of liver tumors. Blood LFTs should be performed
every 3-6 months, and a liver ultrasound should be performed every 6-12 months. If the

## Page 70

68
levels of liver transaminases increase to 3-5 times above normal, the androgen dose
should be tapered until the blood tests improve. Androgen-associated liver adenomas
(benign tumors) may develop with long-term treatment and are predominantly due to the
cellular liver toxicities of the 17 alpha-alkylated androgens. Liver adenomas may resolve
after androgens are discontinued, but some may persist for years after androgen therapy
has ended. Liver adenomas are not a contraindication for HCT. If screening tests raise a
concern for hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver biopsy using a technique appropriate to the
patient’s bleeding risk should be considered. Even without additional risk factors,
malignant transformation of initially benign hepatic adenomas may occur after years of
androgen treatment [43].
Oxymetholone
The most commonly used androgen since 1961 is oxymetholone [40, 41]. The starting dose
of oxymetholone is typically ~2 mg/kg/day, but doses as high as 5 mg/kg/day may be
required. Most patients who will respond do so within three to four months with
stabilization of falling counts or an increase in the hemoglobin or platelet counts. If a
response occurs, then the general strategy is to slowly taper the daily dose of
oxymetholone in 10-20% decrements every three to four months until the lowest effective
dose with minimal side effects is obtained. Over time, the side effects of accelerated linear
growth (ultimately with premature closure of the growth plates) and weight gain
effectively reduce the individual’s dose per kilogram body weight; therefore, the patient’s
dose per kilogram body weight should be recalculated prior to making dose adjustments.
The patient (both male and female) and family should be counseled about the possible
side effects of oxymetholone. Every effort should be made to minimize the side effects by
tapering the dose to the minimum effective dose whenever possible. Aggressive acne
treatment of facial and back lesions may make the treatment more tolerable. Discussion
of the masculinizing side effects, such as hair darkening and development on
lip/groin/axilla and deepening of the voice, should occur before prescription. Long-term
androgen usage may lead to shrinkage and/or impaired development of the testis in males
due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.
If no response is seen after three to four months, then—in the absence of other causes of
cytopenias such as viral, bacterial, or fungal infection—oxymetholone should be
discontinued (although there are anecdotal reports of rare patients responding after six or
more months). Stabilization of hemoglobin levels may be seen sooner than improvements
in platelet counts; white cell responses may occur later or be nonexistent.
Danazol
A few reports [44-46] in the literature show that both male and female FA patients may
benefit from treatment with danazol, an attenuated synthetic androgen that produces
fewer virializing effects than oxymetholone and may cause fewer liver complications. A
recent retrospective study demonstrated the effectiveness of danazol in 7 of 8 patients

## Page 71

69
with FA (starting dose 3.5-7.7 mg/kg/day), including 3 patients (2 females and 1 male) who
were treated successfully for more than three years and 1 patient (female) for more than
10 years without exhibiting progressive marrow failure requiring stem cell transplantation
[46]. The comparative efficacy of danazol versus oxymetholone to treat marrow failure in
patients with FA is unknown. Danazol has been used at doses of 200-800 mg/day (3.3-13.3
mg/kg/day for a 60 kg woman) for months in women to treat endometriosis and is still
used as long-term prophylaxis for hereditary angioedema at a dose of approximately 5
mg/kg/day [47].
Metformin
Metformin is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of
diabetes mellitus that has shown promise in treating hematologic issues in preclinical FA
models. In these studies, metformin increased blood counts and protected cells against
DNA damage [48, 49]. Researchers at Harvard University initiated a phase I clinical trial in
2017 to explore whether metformin increases blood counts in patients with FA. As of June
2020, the trial was still recruiting patients and results from the trial had not yet been
published.
Quercetin
The University of Cincinnati initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in 2012 to assess the safety
profile of oral quercetin therapy in patients with FA. Studies have shown that systemic
reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to hematopoietic progenitor cells fragility [50].
Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables, scavenges free
radicals and has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antineoplastic properties [51, 52]. The
goal of the phase 1 pilot study was to determine long-term safety and efficacy of quercetin
administration in patients with FA. Secondary endpoints included identifying the effects of
quercetin on blood counts. Dose optimization from the phase 1 trial led to development of
a phase II quercetin chemoprevention trial that was initiated in 2018 by the Cincinnati
group. The goal of the phase II trial is to determine the efficacy of a maximum daily dose
of quercetin (4,000 mg/day) in reducing buccal micronuclei as a surrogate marker for DNA
damage and susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma in FA patients post-HCT. As of June
2020, the phase II trial was still recruiting patients and results from the trial had not yet
been published.

Cytokines
Several cytokines have been evaluated for their capacity to stimulate failing bone marrow
in FA patients, but none has proven entirely successful. The cytokines granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (G-CSF) [53] and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) [54] can improve the neutrophil count in patients with FA; however, GM-CSF is no
longer available for clinical use. Treatment with other cytokines has not shown benefit for

## Page 72

70
patients with FA. However, newer agents such as thrombopoietin-mimetic drugs are being
cautiously tested in patients with FA [55].
Treatment with G-CSF may be considered if the neutropenia is associated with recurrent or
serious infections, particularly if the neutrophil count is persistently below 500/mm3 or as
a short-term bridge to transplant. There is, however, concern that cytokine therapy will
stimulate development or progression of cytogenetic abnormalities. Historically, a few
patients also have shown improvements in hemoglobin levels or platelet counts while on
G-CSF; these effects most likely are due to the treatment of, or reduction in, infections.
Long-term follow-up has not been published. Treatment should generally be discontinued
if the neutrophil count fails to improve after eight weeks of G-CSF therapy.
A bone marrow aspirate or biopsy with cytogenetics is recommended prior to the initiation
of cytokine treatment, given the risk of stimulating the growth of a leukemic clone. It is
recommended that patients being treated with cytokines are monitored for bone marrow
morphology and cytogenetics every six months. In the setting of a compelling clinical
indication for cytokine therapy, such as an acute infection, there are no findings to support
withholding cytokines from patients with clonal abnormalities. In such cases, the use of
hematopoietic cytokines should be considered only in consultation with experts in the
care of patients with FA.
Transfusion of Blood Products
Transfusions of red cells or platelets may be needed prior to surgery in patients with the
following:
• Anemia and/or thrombocytopenia
• Progressive marrow failure
• Bone marrow failure that precludes all prospect of an early HCT (due to the lack of an
acceptable donor, severe organ dysfunction, comorbidities, socioeconomic situations,
and/or lack of interest in pursuing HCT as a therapy)
Long-term transfusions with red cells and platelets may become a lifeline for patients for
whom no other treatment options are available. However, if HCT is the goal, transfusions
should be minimized.
Gene Therapy
Gene therapy has been employed for multiple conditions with a hemopoietic component,
including hemoglobinopathies [56], leukemia [57], immunodeficiencies [58], lysosomal
storage disease [59], and Fanconi anemia. The first clinical trials of stem cell gene therapy
for FA used retroviruses to deliver the FANCA or FANCC genes. This early protocol,
however, resulted in either no correction or only transient correction of hematopoietic
cells, an observation consistent with only short-term functional gene complementation
[60-63].

## Page 73

71
Lessons learned from earlier gene therapy clinical trials and preclinical animal model
studies [64-67] cumulatively led to development of improved clinical trial protocols. The
first successful gene therapy trial for patients with variants in FANCA demonstrated that
lentiviral-mediated hematopoietic gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells followed
by delivery in non-conditioned patients led to successful engraftment and expansion of
FANCA gene-corrected cells [68]. Functional laboratory studies also demonstrated that the
normal cells expressed a functional FANCA protein, as the cells were resistant to DNA
damaging agents. Importantly, no adverse events have been reported in any of the
patients to date in the ongoing study. Additional clinical gene therapy trials for patients
with FANCA variants also have been initiated. These trials are addressing additional
challenges with FA gene therapy, such as the role of conditioning and optimization of the
ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell culture.
Gene Editing
Gene editing also is on the horizon as a useful therapy to treat bone marrow failure in
patients with FA, but research is currently in pre-clinical stages. A key differentiating
feature between gene editing and gene therapy is precise gene modification. Current gene
editing systems include zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), meganucleases (MN), transcription
activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly interspaced
palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system. Each system is unique, but each shares the
function that they bind DNA and generate a break in one or both DNA strands. Following
this break, the DNA can be repaired through an error-prone process where the DNA ends
are reconnected. To date, ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 have been used in FA gene
modification in the laboratory [69, 70]; however, because gene editing causes DNA breaks
and FA proteins are required to repair DNA breaks [71] this method may not be viable for
FA patients. More pre-clinical research is needed to determine whether gene editing will
be efficacious for patients with FA.

Summary
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder that results in DNA repair
defects that adversely affect the stability of hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs). This results in the high likelihood that patients with FA will
develop bone marrow failure (BMF) and/or clonal progression to
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
The only cure for BMF at the present time is a hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT). Recommendations for clinical monitoring of BMF
are based on the stability of peripheral blood counts and clonal
abnormalities observed in serial bone marrow examinations. The
decision to use HCT for FA patients with BMF and/or clonal
abnormalities, MDS, or leukemia should be made in consultation with
an FA physician specialist. Recent advancements in HCT protocols
continue to improve survival rates. These advancements include, but
are not limited to, knowledge that HCT without total body radiation
is successful, T-cell depletion should be used when possible, and that
HCT from mis-matched related, unrelated and haploidentical donors
can be successful for patients without any other donor options.
Transplants in general, because of graft-versus-host disease, the
conditioning regimens, and long periods of immunosuppression,
confer an increased risk of earlier onset cancer. This indicates that
close follow up during long-term care following HCT is imperative.
Emerging therapies such as gene therapy also hold promise as
curative options for BMF in patients with FA and the future of BMF
treatment for patients with FA will undoubtedly shift as gene therapy
and gene editing technology matures and efficacy is established.

Chapter 4
Non-HNSCC Solid Tumors in
Patients with Fanconi Anemia

Introduction
Cancer risk and management is a major concern for patients with
Fanconi anemia (FA) due to the DNA repair defects associated with
the disease. The most frequently diagnosed solid tumor cancers in
FA patients include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) and gynecologic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In
addition to gynecologic SCC, patients with FA also develop other
non-HNSCC solid tumors. This chapter describes the type and
incidence of non-HNSCC solid tumors in 2,600 cases and case series
of patients with FA reported in the medical literature from 1927
through 2018, as well as from other cohorts totaling more than 5,500
patients with FA. The numbers of FA patients with any type of cancer
were more than 500 in the case reports and series, and more than
200 in the cohort reports. Cancer risks updated in an FA cohort
within the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Inherited Bone Marrow
Failure Syndromes Program also are discussed [1]. Comparison data
include cancer cases published by the American Cancer Society
(ACS) in 2019 and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results
(SEER) U.S.-based cancer registry [2, 3]. Most of the data on non-
HNSCC were from patients with FA who did not receive a

## Page 82

80
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), although this status was not
always clear from the reports, and thus some of the analyses include
a combination of non-transplanted and transplanted patients.

Non-HNSCC Tumors in Patients with Fanconi
Anemia
The frequencies of rare cancers in patients with FA compared with the general population
reported by the American Cancer Society (ACS) in 2019 are shown in Figure 1 [2]. These
rare types of solid tumors in patients with FA do not follow the frequency pattern observed
in the general population. For example, the five most frequent non-HNSCC cancers in the
general population were breast, lung, prostate, colon, and melanoma (Table 1, Figure 1A),
while the top five non-HNSCC in FA case reports and case series were brain, Wilms tumor,
liver, esophageal, and vulvar cancers (Table 1, Figure 1B). The most frequently reported
cancers in all cohorts of FA patients were similar: liver, vulvar, cervical, esophageal, and
brain (Figure 1C). More than 500 of the 2,600 cases reported with FA had at least one
cancer; more than 70 had HNSCC, and more than 200 had leukemia, with approximately
200 patients (roughly 1 in 13) with non-HNSCC tumors. More than 80 patients had at least
two cancers, although some of those may not have been rare cancers.

well as in a few patients with mutations in FANCN/PALB2, but not in other genotypes. The
most frequent cancers that occurred as single cancers in other genotypes were AML, liver,
esophageal, vulvar, and breast. A few types of cancer were reported in fewer than 10
patients each (i.e., lung, stomach, lymphoma, colon, and sarcomas (corneal

osteosarcoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), renal

Incidence and Risk of Rare Solid Tumors in Patients with Fanconi
Anemia
Most of the rare cancers occurred in FA patients between the ages of 20-40 years, although
liver tumors were reported during the teenage years, perhaps related to the use of
androgens for bone marrow failure. Brain, Wilms, neuroblastoma and lymphoma cancers
typically occurred before age 10 years, primarily in patients with mutations in
FANCD1/BRCA2 and FANCN/PALB2. All of the non-HNSCC solid tumors occurred at
substantially younger ages than in the general population, where the median age for any
type of solid tumors is between 60-70 years (Figure 2). For example, esophageal, breast,
lung, and stomach cancers were reported in FA patients at ages between 20-30 years. It is
important to note that the diagnosis of a malignancy (solid tumors or AML) preceded the
diagnosis of FA in approximately 35% of cases [4]

## Page 85

83

Figure 2. Age at cancer diagnosis in FA cases. The blue bars denote data from the general
population, with a median age between 60-70 years in most cancers. The orange bars
denote cases with FA reported at the individual level, with median ages below 40 years
(most between 20-30 years).
The nature of the descriptive data from case reports and case series does not lend itself to
more sophisticated quantitative analyses, such as cumulative incidence or observed to
expected ratios. These types of analyses have been published in separate cohorts [5-7] and
recently have been updated for the NCI FA cohort [1]. The NCI cohort data were used to
reexamine the role of HCT [8] and it was determined that all solid tumors, especially
HNSCC, occurred at a higher rate in transplanted patients compared with patients who
were not transplanted (Figure 3). The cancer sites following HCT included HNSCC
(particularly oral cavity), as well as vulvar, larynx, and brain. In addition, cancers unique to
transplanted patients were thyroid cancer and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) [1].

## Page 86

84

Figure 3. Ratio of observed to expected cancers in the NCI Fanconi Anemia cohort. The
bars compare the observed numbers of cases to those expected from the Surveillance
Epidemiology and End Results registry, after adjustment for age, sex, and birth cohort.
Standard incidence ratio data are log transformed, since the values range from 10 to more
than 1000. The blue bars denote patients with FA who did not have a hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT). The orange bars denote patients with FA who had an HCT. The data
suggest that the relative risk of most FA-type cancers (particularly HNSCC and vulvar SCC)
is higher in the transplanted group. In addition, cases of cancer of the larynx, thyroid, and
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma appeared only in the transplanted group [1].
The NCI cohort data also allowed determination of the ratio of observed (O) to expected
(E) cancer cases, adjusted for age, sex, and birth cohort, based on data from the SEER
Program. The quantity O/E is often called the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Accurate
SIR calculations are not possible using literature case reports because of the potential for
biased reporting of cases (numerators) and the lack of information about how many
persons would be reported in the literature were they to develop a cancer (denominators).
The NCI cohort enrolled all available patients and followed them consistently and, thus,
both numerators and denominators were well defined. Some of the rare cancers occurring
in FA patients are extremely rare in individuals of the same ages without FA. It is essential
to take age into account when assessing risk. The O/E ratios for rare cancers do not take
age into account and were similar to the high ratios observed for HNSCC and gynecologic
cancers (e.g., >1000-fold for esophageal cancer). The limited data from the NCI FA cohort
suggest that cancers that developed following HCT were higher risk cancers than those
that developed in non-transplanted patients; additionally, the types of cancers that

## Page 87

85
developed in transplanted patients were not typically seen in the non-transplanted
patients (Figure 3) [1, 8].
The crude rate of solid tumors in FA patients is approximately 5-20%, based on the
numbers of solid tumors reported divided by the total number of patients reported in the
literature cases since 1927. The NCI cohort data were used in competing risk analyses to
determine that the cumulative incidence or probability of solid tumors as the first adverse
event was about 25% by age 50 years. In a hypothetical scenario in which severe bone
marrow failure could be excluded, the cumulative incidence of solid tumors was 75% [8].
The most frequent solid tumors appear to be HNSCC and gynecologic SCC. While the
absolute numbers of the rare solid tumors are small by contrast, the relative risks for some
of them are as high as for HNSCC and gynecologic SCC, and the absolute risk is high
enough that patients should be monitored for them closely.
Surveillance and Management of Rare Solid Tumors
Surveillance recommendations for non-HNSCC and non-gynecologic SCC cancers in
patients with FA is outlined in Table 2. Surveillance of solid tumors should start on or
before the ages listed in the table. Some cancer types have no recommendations for
prevention and/or surveillance. Always consult physicians if there are any symptoms of
concern.

Treatments for solid tumors, including the rare tumors discussed in this chapter, in patients
who do not have FA include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Options for treating
solid tumors in patients with FA are limited. The best modality is surgery when possible.
Radiation may be effective, although it may lead to complications such as skin reactions,
mucositis, ulceration, etc.

## Page 89

Study Limitations
The data reviewed in this chapter have several limitations. Some patients may have been
reported more than once. Patients reported in the older literature may have been
misclassified and may not have had FA. There may have been biased reporting,
overreporting of case reports with cancer, and underreporting of those without cancer.
Since cancer is age-dependent, and many of the cases were reported as young children
and may have developed tumors after they were reported, the cumulative incidence of
cancer may be greater than indicated from the published data. This literature review was
based primarily on cases reported in English and, thus, cases in other languages may have
been overlooked. Cases reported in series for which the focus was the gene and mutation
may have had insufficiently detailed description of their clinical problems, including
cancer.

Summary
Patients with FA are at high risk for developing head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (see Chapter 5) and other non-
HNSCC cancers, such as gynecologic squamous cell carcinoma (see
Chapter 7). This chapter summarizes the type and incidence of all rare
non-HNSCC solid tumors in cohorts as well as case reports and series
of patients with FA reported in the medical literature from 1927
through 2018. The data show that rare solid tumors in FA patients do
not follow frequency patterns observed in the general population. The
top five non-HNSCC cancers diagnosed in case reports and case series
of FA patients are brain, Wilms, liver, esophageal and vulvar cancer.
Importantly, most non-HNSCC tumors that develop in patients with FA
occurred at substantially younger ages (20-50 years) compared to the
general population (60-70 years). The data also show that patients
treated with hematopoietic cell transplant develop higher risk tumors
than non-transplanted patients. Therapeutic management of non-
HNSCC tumors using modalities currently used in the general
population, such as radiation and/or chemotherapy, are generally
contraindicated in patients with FA due to issues related to high
toxicity. Surgical removal is currently the best approach for treating
solid tumors in patients with FA; however, improved screening
techniques are needed to identify early neoplastic lesions. Research
that focuses on identifying optimal ways to diagnose, prevent, and
treat rare solid tumors in patients with FA is desperately needed.

Head and Neck Cancer in
Patients with Fanconi Anemia

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is significantly
more common in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) than in the
general population. This chapter provides an overview of HNSCC in
patients with FA. Focus areas include early surveillance, risk factors,
diagnosis, and currently available treatment options. Head and neck
cancers are diagnosed at a younger age (20-50 years) in patients
with FA and often at an advanced stage. The cornerstone treatment
for FA patients with HNSCC is surgery; however, outcomes are poor
if the diagnosis is at an advanced stage. Patients with FA also have
significant toxicity issues from systemic chemotherapies used to
treat HNSCC in the general population. The precise risk factors
associated with HNSCC for patients with FA have yet to be defined,
although studies have shown that DNA repair defects associated
with the disease, increased age, and graft-versus-host disease
(GvHD) after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) correlate with
increased risk for HNSCC development. Causative well-defined risk
factors in the general population, such as tobacco and alcohol use,
should be avoided by patients with FA. It is recommended that early
surveillance by oral examination begin at a young age.

## Page 92

Head and Neck Cancer in the General Population
Head and neck cancers encompass a wide variety of tumors that typically begin in the
squamous cells that line the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, nasal cavity, pharynx, and
larynx. These tumors often are referred to as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC). Approximately 30,000 individuals are diagnosed with head and neck cancer in
the United States annually, and about 30% of these patients die from their disease.
Increasingly, HNSCC is an international health problem, representing the fifth most
common cancer type and cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1].
The vast majority of HNSCC cases (more than 90%) develop following exposure to
carcinogens, including tobacco and alcohol [2, 3], betel nut [4], Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV),
and sexually transmitted viral pathogens such as human papillomavirus (HPV) [5]. Head
and neck cancers are prototypic tobacco-related cancers. The risk for the development of
HNSCC and the subsequent risk for the development of second primary cancers in the
upper aerodigestive tract is directly attributable to the duration and intensity of tobacco
exposure. Tobacco-related cancers also can occur in non-smokers as a result of
environmental smoke exposure. Chronic consumption of alcohol is estimated to increase
the risk for HNSCC by two- to three-fold in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover,
individuals who use both tobacco and alcohol have up to 10-20 times higher risk for
HNSCC than people who do not use tobacco or alcohol. Approximately 5% of HNSCC
develop in individuals who do not smoke or consume alcohol. Emerging evidence suggests
that HPV may play a role in the development of HNSCC, with HPV detected in more than
70-80% of cases of oropharyngeal cancer.

Head and Neck Cancer in Patients with
Fanconi Anemia
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common solid tumor in
patients with FA. The incidence of HNSCC in FA patients is 500- to 700-fold higher than in
the general population [6-9].  The main cause of death in adulthood for patients with FA is
HNSCC and the risk increases with age. In some cases, diagnosis of HNSCC tumors
precedes the diagnosis of FA [10]; therefore, FA testing should be considered in patients
younger than age 40 who develop HNSCC, especially if they have atypical findings such as
borderline anemia or an atypical response to cytotoxic treatment.
Compared with the general population, the age of onset, distribution, and course of
HNSCC is significantly different in patients with FA. Patients with FA tend to be diagnosed
with HNSCC between the ages of 20-50 years [10], whereas individuals in the general
population tend to be diagnosed between the ages of 60-70 years. Patients with FA also

## Page 93

91
have a higher proportion of HNSCC in the oral cavity (approximately 65%), the vast
majority of which involve the tongue, compared with the general population. Furthermore,
a much higher proportion of HNSCC in patients with FA is diagnosed in advanced stages
compared with the general population. Despite aggressive treatment, the outcome of
HNSCC in FA patients is significantly poorer than that in the general population. Moreover,
even after cure of the primary HNSCC, patients with FA are more likely than the general
population to develop second primary cancers (more than 60% versus ~30%, respectively)
[10]. The anatomic distribution of second primary cancers also is significantly different in
patients with FA compared with the general population. Whereas patients with HNSCC in
the general population tend to develop second primary cancers in the lung and
esophagus, patients with FA develop second primary cancers in the head and neck region,
genitourinary tract, and skin. Interestingly, the pattern of second primary cancers in
patients with FA resembles that observed in HPV-associated HNSCC in the general
population [11].
Risk Factors Associated with Head and Neck Cancer in Patients
with Fanconi Anemia
Most individuals with FA are now living into adulthood, due to significant improvements in
bone marrow transplant outcomes. With increased age, these patients are experiencing a
significant escalation in the incidence of cancer, which now represents the major cause of
death in the FA adult population. Age alone is a significant risk factor for HNSCC for
patients with FA. They are diagnosed with HNSCC earlier than the general population (20-
50 years vs. 60-70 years) and the risk increases significantly with age. Cumulative genomic
instability from DNA repair defects that are a hallmark of FA also contributes significantly
to this age-related risk [12].
Patients with FA have the highest risk for HNSCC amongst all patients with inherited
genetic syndromes (e.g., Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Bloom’s syndrome). Unlike individuals
with an inherited mutation in the retinoblastoma gene (RB), nearly all of whom develop
tumors of the retina, not all patients with FA develop HNSCC. Like the association between
radiation exposure and the development of high-grade sarcomas in patients with an
inherited RB mutation, a co-factor(s) is likely required for FA patients to develop HNSCC.
The precise cause(s) of and co-factor(s) for the increased risk of HNSCC in patients with FA
have yet to be defined. The type of FA mutation and severity of manifestations have not
been clearly associated with the development of HNSCC. A 2004 study [13] suggests that
bone marrow transplantation increases the risk for HNSCC development in patients with
FA, and primarily attributed the increased risk to the development of acute and/or chronic
graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). However, high numbers of patients with FA who have
never undergone HCT also develop HNSCC [14]. An association between GvHD and HNSCC
also has been suggested in patients without FA [15]. Tobacco and alcohol consumption are
less commonly reported in patients with FA than in the general population; nonetheless,

## Page 94

92
both remain major risk factors for the development of HNSCC in patients with FA. Most
studies support a role for HPV in gynecological malignancies, but its precise contributions
to HNSCC in patients with FA remain controversial. Some studies [16, 17] suggest that HPV
may be a major contributor to HNSCC development in patients with FA, whereas other
studies [18, 19] dispute these results. Laboratory studies show that mutations in genes that
cause FA increase susceptibility to HPV-induced carcinogenesis [20, 21]. Overall, the
scientific literature suggests that multiple factors contribute to the development of HNSCC
in patients with FA, although the precise contributions of individual factors remain to be
defined.
Prevention of Head and Neck Cancer in Patients with
Fanconi Anemia
Abstaining from Alcohol and Tobacco
The causal link between tobacco and alcohol exposure and the development of HNSCC is
well-established. The use of tobacco and tobacco products should be discouraged
categorically, including exposure to secondhand smoke. Further, marijuana and e-
cigarette use also have been associated with the development of HNSCC in the general
population [22]; therefore, FA patients are encouraged to abstain from use of these agents.
While it is best to abstain from alcohol use, individuals who consume alcohol should
restrict their intake to no more than one drink equivalent per month. The chronic use of
alcohol-containing mouthwashes also should be discouraged (see Chapter 6).
Maintenance of Oral Hygiene
Several reports suggest that poor oral hygiene and chronic, repeated physical trauma to
the oral cavity may promote the development of HNSCC [23-25], although the evidence is
not yet conclusive. Therefore, maintenance of proper oral hygiene and routine dental
evaluations are recommended. The use of oral appliances, braces, and dental X-rays do
not need to be restricted in patients with FA given the lack of evidence to suggest a causal
association with HNSCC. This subject is discussed in Chapter 6.
Human Papillomavirus Vaccination
The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in HNSCC development in patients with FA is
controversial [16, 17, 19, 26, 27] and more studies are needed. Despite the controversy, it is
recommended that both male and female patients with FA receive an HPV vaccination at
an early age [28, 29]. See Chapter 7 for detailed vaccination recommendations for female
patients with FA.

Surveillance of Head and Neck Cancer in Patients with
Fanconi Anemia
The high incidence of HNSCC combined with the poor outcome of this disease in patients
with FA underscore the need for careful HNSCC surveillance. Surveillance should begin at
age 10, which is based on literature reports of the earliest age of HNSCC diagnosis [8, 10].
The oral cavities of individuals with FA often contain multiple lesions. Distinguishing
suspicious lesions from those that are non-cancerous requires the input of a health care
provider with significant experience in the evaluation and management of HNSCC for FA
patients. Qualified professionals may have dental, oral surgery, otolaryngology, or general
surgery backgrounds supplemented with specialized training in detecting and/or treating
HNSCC. Routine oral cancer screening by a general dentist can supplement but should not
replace thorough HNSCC screening.
Oral Examination
Thorough head and neck examination in patients with FA should occur every six months.
The sites at risk for development of HNSCC include all areas of the upper aerodigestive
tract. Therefore, all mucosal surfaces of the head and neck region should be examined
thoroughly. The oral cavity, the most common site for HNSCC in patients with FA, and the
proximal oropharynx can be effectively evaluated through the mouth by visual
examination and palpation. Examination of the distal oropharynx, nasopharynx, larynx,
and hypopharynx requires the use of either a transoral mirror or a flexible fiberoptic
laryngoscope. Although patients with FA have a higher rate of SCC in the cervical
esophagus than the general population [30], the routine use of esophagoscopy for
screening is not advocated. Symptom-based evaluation for esophageal cancer needs to be
considered. Any patient with odynophagia, dysphagia, or other localizing symptoms merits
evaluation with a barium swallow study and/or esophagoscopy.
Importance of Brush Biopsy for Patients with Fanconi Anemia
The oral cavities of patients with FA often have multiple leukoplakia-like lesions that are
typically not malignant. In the past, all suspicious lesions were diagnosed through
incisional tissue biopsy only. Early surveillance of tumor development in the head and
neck region of individuals with FA is essential; however, conducting numerous incisional
biopsies on suspicious lesions is invasive and painful. Patients with FA therefore require
alternative and effective early surveillance strategies that do not cause extensive tissue
damage. Fourteen years ago, a medical team from Germany initiated a study to see if a
non-invasive brush biopsy procedure could accurately determine pre-malignant and
malignant tissue in a large cohort of patients with FA. This study, published in 2020,
showed that in 713 patients with FA worldwide, careful examination of the oral cavity
followed by brush biopsy and cytology identified pre-malignant and malignant lesions
with high sensitivity (97.7%) and specificity (84.5%). The addition of DNA ploidy analysis to
brush biopsy samples examined by cytology increased the sensitivity and specificity to

## Page 96

94
100% and 92.2%, respectively [31]. This is a highly significant finding, as 63% of lesions in
the study were diagnosed as pre-malignant or early-stage cancer and were curable
through surgery.
It is important to point out that once suspicious lesions are identified as precancerous or
cancerous by a brush biopsy, they should be biopsied with an incisional biopsy
immediately. Suspicious lesions not found pre-cancerous or cancerous by brush biopsy
should be closely monitored. Stability or shrinkage in size of the lesion can be used as an
indicator to continue observation. Growth or changes in characteristics of the lesion (i.e.,
thickening or erythroplakia) require further attention.
Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer in Patients with
Fanconi Anemia
Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy—either alone or in combination—are used to treat
HNSCC in the general population. As a general rule, early-stage disease is treated either
with surgery or with radiation therapy, whereas advanced-stage disease requires multi-
modality therapy with surgery followed by radiation with or without chemotherapy or
concomitant treatment with chemoradiation therapy. While all of these approaches can
be used in the general population, significant negative side-effects limit the use of
chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patients with FA. Therefore, several modifications
are required in the management of HNSCC in patients with FA.
Treatment Team
Optimal treatment of HNSCC requires a treatment team that includes not only surgeons
(cancer and reconstructive specialists), radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists, but
also specialized dentists, oral surgeons, speech and language pathologists, nurses, as well
as many other professionals. This team should work in close collaboration with other FA
specialists to provide comprehensive care.
Treatment Approach to Head and Neck Cancer in Patients with Fanconi Anemia
The following factors complicate the management of HNSCC in FA patients, making
surgery the preferred therapeutic modality in patients with FA:
• The tumors of FA patients tend to be very aggressive and often are present in
advanced stages.
• The non-cancerous cells of FA patients are more sensitive to treatments that crosslink
DNA, such as the chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin, and external beam radiation—two
mainstays of HNSCC treatment for the general population.
• HNSCC cells in FA patients are not as sensitive as non-cancerous cells to DNA-
crosslinking agents. Therefore, HNSCC in FA patients does not respond to sub-
therapeutic doses of radiation. Therefore, surgery is the preferred therapeutic
modality in FA patients.

Recommendations for Surgical Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer in Patients with
Fanconi Anemia
In contrast to the other treatment modalities, surgical therapy for HNSCC in FA patients is
well tolerated and can result in durable local control for small tumors without lymph node
metastases [32]. Patients with FA exhibit no significant increase in the incidence of
complications following surgery, including wound infections or long-term negative side
effects associated with surgical scarring. Accordingly, the consensus opinion is that surgery
should be considered the primary curative modality in all FA patients who develop HNSCC.
A successful outcome following head and neck surgery requires a multidisciplinary
preoperative assessment and optimization of the patient, intraoperative management, and
postoperative care. To minimize the risks associated with surgery, FA patients should be
optimized medically by a hematologist who is experienced in the management of patients
with FA. Depending on the extent of surgery and the anticipated outcomes, a pain
management specialist and a mental health professional should be consulted prior to
surgery to help the patient cope with any negative after-effects.
Surgery for HNSCC in patients with FA should follow the same parameters that have been
established for the general population. In general, a wide complete excision of the primary
tumor should be performed with adequate margins. The exact type and extent of surgical
resection should be dictated by the primary site, size, and extent of the tumor. Large
cancers that involve multiple subsites of the head and neck should be excised via an open
approach as in the general population. However, smaller accessible tumors can be
resected trans-orally using robotic or laser instruments. In general, tumors of the oral
cavity and pharynx should be excised with at least 1-cm margins. The margins for
laryngeal tumors need not be as comprehensive, due to the unique biology of laryngeal
cancers and anatomy of the larynx.
Management of the neck also follows principles established for the management of
HNSCC in the general population. In general, cancers that are classified clinically as N0
disease with high risk for occult metastasis or small volume N1 disease may be managed
with a selective neck dissection, whereas modified neck dissection or even radical neck
dissection may be required for more advanced regional disease. A recent study in patients
without FA showed that elective nodal dissections in patients with oral cavity cancers with
an N0 neck are associated with a significant improvement in overall survival [33].
Therefore, it is recommended that elective nodal dissection be included as part of
management in FA patients who have oral cancer as well.
Reconstruction of the primary site defect should follow the guidelines established for
reconstruction in patients with HNSCC in the general population and should not be limited
based on the presence of FA. Several case reports have described the successful use of free
flap reconstruction in FA patients [34-36]. Therefore, the use of free flaps for
reconstruction should be considered as indicated, without restrictions. The specific details
of surgical management are discussed in other references [37, 38].

Radiation Therapy of Head and Neck Cancer in Patients with Fanconi Anemia
Radiation treatment is associated with severe negative after-effects in patients with FA,
and many patients cannot complete a full course of radiation. The risk of dying from the
negative after-effects of radiation is as high as 50%. Death may be due to local effects, but
systemic effects such as bone marrow failure are also major contributors. Those who
survive radiation treatment face severe side effects, including xerostomia, dysphagia,
esophageal stenosis, laryngeal edema, and wound breakdown. Therefore, radiation
therapy should be used only in FA patients for whom it is absolutely required for disease
control.
When radiation therapy is to be utilized, FA patients must be monitored closely for signs of
severe toxicity. It is important to keep in mind that tumor cells in FA patients do not have
increased susceptibility to the effects of radiation (unlike the tumor cells in most
individuals in the general population). Therefore, treatment with radiation should be
planned for the same doses used in the management of patients without FA.
Radiosensitivity of normal tissues in FA patients is a concern as there have been several
case reports of severe mucositis occurring in the oral cavity of FA patients after doses of
10–20 Gy with conventional field sizes encompassing the entire oral cavity. These clinical
presentations have usually been associated with conventional fractionation of 1.8–2.0 Gy
per day, five days a week, to a target volume that included the entire oral cavity and
oropharynx.
An approach has been designed in which a small field of 5 cm x 5 cm is treated for one
week (five fractions) at reduced fraction size of 0.5 Gy per day, with daily examination for
mucositis and daily peripheral blood counts. Both patients with FA and animal models of
FA [39-41] with radiosensitivity have demonstrated significant abscopal bone marrow
suppression and leukopenia. Patients tolerating the first week of reduced field and
reduced fraction size then can be moved up to a second week of same reduced field size,
but now with conventional fractionation of 1.8–2.0 Gy per day. Daily measurements of
mucositis by physical exam and peripheral blood counts should be continued. Patients
who tolerate this therapy then can move on to the entire clinical target volume with
reduced fraction size of 0.5 Gy per day. Subsequently, in the absence of significant
mucositis or leukopenia, patients may move on to complete radiotherapy with
conventional fraction size and full target volume to the usual post-operative radiotherapy
dose of 55–60 Gy. Post-operative radiotherapy for oral cavity cancers is usually indicated if
there are positive resection margins and/or positive regional lymph nodes.
Systemic Therapies for Head and Neck Cancer
Systemic therapy using cross-linking agents and other targeted therapies is an integral
component of the management for locally advanced, recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC
in the general population. Patients with FA cannot be safely treated with DNA cross-linking

## Page 99

97
agents due to high toxicity. Other non-cytotoxic targeted therapies may be viable options,
but more research is needed to understand their effects on patients with FA.
Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in the General Population
In patients in the general population with surgically resected HNSCC, cisplatin (100 mg/m2
intravenously once every 21 days) administered concurrently with post-operative radiation
therapy has been demonstrated to improve locoregional control and overall survival in
randomized studies [42, 43]. A pooled analysis of two phase III clinical trials demonstrated
that patients with positive margins and/or extracapsular nodal spread benefited the most
from the addition of chemotherapy to post-operative radiation therapy [44]. Based on
these results, treatment guidelines currently recommend adjuvant cisplatin-based
concurrent chemoradiation therapy for patients with these high-risk adverse features.
In patients with locally advanced disease who are treated non-surgically with curative
intent, the integration of platinum-based chemotherapy concurrently with radiation
therapy has been demonstrated to improve locoregional control and overall survival in
prospective clinical trials and meta-analysis, compared with radiation therapy alone.
These studies demonstrated an absolute 5-year survival benefit of approximately 6.5% [45,
46]. As a result, concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation therapy has become a
standard option for non-surgical management of locally advanced HNSCC. However, the
addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy to radiation therapy has been associated with an
increased incidence of adverse events, including mucositis, dermatitis, skin toxicities, and
the need for feeding tube placement [45].
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition in the General Population
Cetuximab (Erbitux) is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and is used for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC.
Cetuximab has been shown to improve locoregional control and survival when added to
definitive radiation therapy in patients with oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and
hypopharyngeal tumors in a randomized phase III clinical trial [47]. Based on these results,
cetuximab has been approved by regulatory agencies throughout the world to be used in
this setting. Cetuximab has a more favorable side effect profile than cytotoxic
chemotherapy. Clinically relevant cetuximab-induced adverse events include skin rash,
hypomagnesemia, grade 3-5 hypersensitivity reaction (in approximately 3% of patients),
and a small increase in the incidence of radiotherapy-induced mucositis. Blood toxicity is
not usually observed with concurrent cetuximab and radiation therapy. Concurrent
cetuximab and radiation therapy recently has been directly compared to concurrent
cisplatin and radiation therapy in two randomized studies of patients with HPV-related,
locally advanced oropharynx cancers treated non-surgically. These studies have shown
inferior locoregional control for the cetuximab-treated patients [48, 49]. As such,
concurrent cisplatin with radiation therapy is still considered the standard of care for most

## Page 100

98
patients with HPV-related and non-HPV-related locally advanced HNSCC treated without
surgery. Studies evaluating the role of cetuximab in the post-operative setting are ongoing.
Systemic Therapy for Recurrent or Metastatic Disease in the General Population
For patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease, the cornerstone of treatment is
systemic therapy with single agents (cisplatin, taxanes, 5-fluorouracil, or methotrexate), or
platinum-based doublet regimens (the combination of a platinum-based drug with other
chemotherapy agents) to maintain quality of life and prolong survival. Cetuximab has
activity as single agent, and also has been shown to improve survival when added to first-
line platinum/5-fluorouracil in a randomized phase III trial [50]. More recently,
immunotherapy has emerged as a novel strategy to treat recurrent and/or metastatic
disease. Immunotherapy has a different mechanism of action than chemotherapy. It
stimulates the patient’s own immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. As
such, side effects related to immunotherapy are different and usually less severe than
chemotherapy, and mostly consist of auto-immune reactions resulting from normal cell
injury by the activated immune system. Immunotherapy also benefits a relatively small
proportion of patients. However, when effective, immunotherapy may control the disease
for longer periods of time when compared to chemotherapy and/or cetuximab. The anti-
programmed death-1 (PD-1) immunotherapy drugs nivolumab or pembrolizumab have
been shown to improve survival compared to standard therapies in patients who have
failed platinum-based treatments [51, 52]. In treatment-naïve patients with recurrent
and/or metastatic disease, pembrolizumab alone (in selected patients) or pembrolizumab
added to chemotherapy also have been shown to improve survival over the standard-of-
care regimen of chemotherapy plus cetuximab.
Systemic Therapies for Head and Neck Cancer in Patients with Fanconi Anemia
The use of chemotherapy—particularly DNA-damaging agents—in FA patients is
challenging, especially as it pertains to bone marrow failure and increased risk for normal
tissue injury. The issue is further complicated by the lack of prospective trials, or even
large retrospective series evaluating the safety and efficacy of cytotoxic agents in this
patient population. Table 1 summarizes the published experience with the use of cytotoxic
chemotherapy in FA patients for treatment of multiple tumor types (the majority of which
are HNSCC). Notwithstanding possible publication bias, the limited data demonstrate that
standard doses and schedules of chemotherapy do not seem to be feasible in patients with
FA. Furthermore, cytotoxic chemotherapy at both standard and low doses is associated
with severe, and in many cases fatal, toxicities and poor treatment outcomes.
The use of biologic agents in FA patients is an attractive alternative to cytotoxic
chemotherapy, given the more favorable side effect profile of biologic agents.
Nonetheless, cetuximab (the only targeted agent approved for HNSCC) has been used only
anecdotally in FA patients and seems to be better tolerated than cytotoxic chemotherapy
(Table 1), but efficacy in the FA setting is unknown. The use of anti-PD-1 inhibitors in FA

## Page 101

99
patients could be an alternative to cytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent and/or
metastatic disease, but experience in FA patients also has been limited. Challenges
regarding the use of this modality in FA patients include risk of activation of graft-versus-
host disease (GvHD) in post-transplant patients [53], and possible lower efficacy compared
to the general population, given the presence of immune dysfunction in FA individuals.
These concerns, however, remain to be characterized through clinical observations.
Systemic therapies serve only as an adjunct to the cornerstone treatment—adequate
surgery and/or radiation therapy—for patients without FA who have locally advanced
disease. In patients with FA, the highest chance for long-term disease-free survival is
achieved with adequate surgery (and/or possibly radiation therapy). Because of the high
incidence of complications related to cytotoxic agents in patients with FA, the risks of
integrating cytotoxic chemotherapy to the treatment regimen outweigh the potential
benefits in most situations. Therefore, the use of cytotoxic agents in FA patients who have
locally advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancers is strongly
discouraged. For selected cases in which chemotherapy and/or biologic therapy or
immunotherapy are to be considered, it is recommended that treatment is delivered in
centers with extensive experience managing head and neck cancers and FA.

Rehabilitation and Lifestyle Modification Post-Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer
The treatment of HNSCC can be debilitating. Rehabilitation should be initiated, as needed,
to optimize the patient’s functional, psychological, and vocational outcomes. The negative
aftereffects of surgical tumor removal on speech and swallowing require intervention by
physical and rehabilitation specialists (e.g., neck and shoulder exercises, speech and
swallowing therapy, etc.). In addition, paralyzed vocal cords and stricture or obstruction of
the pharynx also require intervention. Cosmetic restoration of the face is crucial to
psychological rehabilitation. Following radiation therapy, patients may require
management of xerostomia, dental care, and prevention of fibrosis-related complications
such as trismus. Patients should be placed on long-term care specifically with respect to
dental management. Monitoring of dentition should be maintained and prevention
measures for caries initiated, including the use of fluoride treatments in all patients.
Following chemotherapy, patients may require management of kidney function, hearing,
and damage to peripheral nerves.

Summary
Patients with FA have an increased risk for developing aggressive
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), especially of the
oral cavity. Until new therapeutic and preventative measures are
available, strict abstinence from tobacco and alcohol, avoidance of
second-hand smoke, maintenance of oral hygiene, and aggressive
routine screening are the most immediate ways to reduce the
development and morbidity of HNSCC in FA patients. Early and
frequent head and neck examinations, including careful oral cavity
evaluations and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, are important
surveillance measures. Appropriate surgical resection remains the
mainstay of treatment for patients with FA, because radiation and
chemotherapy are poorly tolerated. If radiation and chemotherapy
are required for advanced tumors, they should be used with caution
and by physicians who have experience in identifying, preventing,
and treating associated complications.

Chapter 6
Oral Health Care for Patients
with Fanconi Anemia

Introduction
The health of the mouth and surrounding craniofacial structures is
central to overall health. All patients with Fanconi anemia (FA),
regardless of age, should seek professional dental care and
perform adequate oral hygiene practices at home to prevent and
control oral and craniofacial diseases, conditions, and injuries. With
a few exceptions, dental treatment is similar for FA patients and
individuals in the general population. This chapter provides
guidance on dental care and oral health maintenance for patients
with FA and educates dental practitioners about particular aspects
of FA that can impact dental treatment.

Importance of Oral Hygiene
Good oral hygiene lowers the risk of oral health problems such as tooth decay, gingivitis,
and periodontitis. Several reports have suggested that good oral hygiene also reduces the
risk of cancers such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [1] and
esophageal cancer [2], although the evidence is not yet conclusive. The incidence of
HNSCC in patients with FA is 500- to 700-fold higher than the general population (see
Chapter 5). Therefore, it is important that patients with FA maintain the recommended oral
hygiene and professional dental care routines summarized in this chapter.

## Page 110

108
The oral cavity harbors a variety of microorganisms, also known as oral microbiota. This
community of microorganisms is composed predominantly of bacteria, although fungi and
viruses also can be present. There is increasing evidence for the potential contribution of
oral microorganisms and oral inflammation in HNSCC development in the general
population [3-7]. Elevated levels of bacteria species, such as Helicobater pylori, Neisseria,
Veilonella, and Fusobacteriam nucleatum, have been associated with cancers, including
gastric, esophageal and colon cancer [8-10]. Furthermore, periodontitis, which is mediated
by oral bacteria and inflammation, has been suggested as a possible risk factor for HNSCC
[5]. Even though these associations do not imply causation, it is prudent to control the
circumstances that may lead to gingivitis and periodontitis through adequate and routine
oral hygiene practices.
Toothbrushing
Dental plaque on the surface of teeth contains a thick film of bacteria that can be
removed only by a dental professional or by brushing with a toothbrush. The surface of the
tongue also is heavily populated with microorganisms, which can contribute to halitosis
and gum diseases. For home care, twice daily toothbrushing and daily tongue cleaning is
the most effective method to remove plaque and bacteria to prevent gum diseases and
tooth decay. Manual and electric toothbrushes are overall equivalent in their ability to
remove plaque. If an individual has physical limitations that can impact his or her physical
ability to hold onto and use a toothbrush, adaptive aids may need to be employed. Parents
of young children with FA should brush the child’s teeth until the child can competently do
so independently.
The frequency of toothbrushing should be increased in patients who have a high risk for
caries, such as individuals with reduced salivary flow, known as xerostomia. Xerostomia
can occur in FA patients [11] and may develop as a side effect of certain medications,
stress, anxiety, diabetes, dehydration, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), or radiation
therapy for head and neck tumors.
Toothpastes
Patients should use a toothpaste that contains fluoride, which is the most effective agent
for preventing dental decay. Many natural toothpastes do not contain fluoride and
therefore do not help to reduce the risk of caries. Some toothpastes contain the
antimicrobial, triclosan, which also is used in a number of skin cleaners and scrubs. An
increasing number of studies suggest that triclosan may alter hormone regulation, and
there are concerns about the emergence of triclosan-resistant bacteria. Although the
potential detrimental effects of triclosan remain inconclusive, patients with FA are advised
to avoid products containing triclosan due to their predisposition to endocrine disorders.
Some whitening toothpastes contain abrasive agents and chemical additives, such as
sodium bicarbonate or sodium pyrophosphate, to help break down and remove surface

## Page 111

109
stains. Whitening toothpastes might also contain bleaching agents, such as hydrogen
peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which may be a concern for patients with FA due the
potential carcinogenic effects of peroxide. Therefore, whitening toothpastes are not worth
the potential health effects that might be caused by exposure to hydrogen peroxide.
Plaque Removal Devices
Plaque that forms between teeth is virtually unreachable by toothbrushing, but should be
removed at least once daily by flossing to prevent gum disease and cavities. Various
plaque-removal devices are available, including floss, tape, electric interdental cleaners,
wooden sticks, and interdental and end-tufted brushes. The choice of device should be
based on the anatomy of the teeth and the dexterity of the patient; therefore, patients with
FA who have hand and arm abnormalities may need to experiment to find a device that
works well and is easy to manipulate.
Mouth Rinses and Topical Fluoride Treatments
Mouth rinses containing fluoride can be used to prevent tooth decay, rinses containing
antimicrobials can prevent both tooth decay and gum disease, and both types of rinses can
be used to improve breath odor. However, many mouth rinses contain alcohol, with
concentrations ranging from 6-26.9%. Alcohol is known to increase the risk of HNSCC (see
Chapter 5) and it is recommended that patients with FA avoid the use of mouth rinses that
contain alcohol. Alcohol-free mouth rinses are available and appear to be as effective as
their alcohol-containing counterparts [12].
Mouth rinses that contain compounds to kill bacteria, including chlorhexidine (CHX) or
other anti-microbials, can provide effective plaque removal in circumstances where
mechanical plaque removal is not possible, such as after oral surgical procedures. In the
U.S., mouth rinses that contain antibiotics are available by prescription only and generally
need to be mixed by a pharmacist. Mouth rinses that contain povidone-iodine should not
be used by patients who are allergic to iodine, children under 6 years of age, patients with
thyroid disorders, or patients taking lithium.
A number of over-the-counter mouth rinses are available to help control plaque
accumulation. Some products contain 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride, a compound that
kills bacteria, or phenolic essential oils, which also reduce plaque and gingivitis. However,
patients should be aware that many of these formulations have an alcohol content of 20%
or greater, and should be avoided. Alcohol-free formulations are available and appear to
be equally as effective [13].
Topical fluoride treatments are available over-the-counter or by prescription, and are
suitable for use in children as well as adults. Topical fluoride treatments can be self-
applied using gels, mouth rinses, or varnishes. The application method should be selected
based on the patient’s ability to use the method of application.

Professional Oral Health Care
All FA patients require professional dental care. The dental health care team should
include a dentist and a dental hygienist who are aware of the complexities of the oral
health issues in patients with FA and, when needed, can include other dental specialists.
When appropriate, the dental health care team will work in close collaboration with the
primary FA health care specialist to provide coordinated, comprehensive care.
Oral Examinations
Individuals should receive routine oral and dental examinations every six months.
Examinations can occur more frequently if changes occur in the patient’s medical and/or
dental conditions, such as the development of periodontitis, diabetes, or xerostomia. In
addition, FA patients have increased risk for developing HNSCC or oral cancer; therefore,
the primary objectives of professional oral exams include the prevention and early
detection of oral diseases such as dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral cancer.
Oral examination methods for cancer detection in patients with FA and recommendations
for biopsy are discussed in Chapter 5.
During an exam, the dentist should evaluate the inside of the mouth as well as the soft
tissues of the head and neck; any unusual findings should be further investigated. Caries
can be detected by the clinical and radiographic examination of tooth surfaces and
restorations. Changes in the color, consistency, and contour of the gums can reveal the
development of gingivitis and periodontitis. Furthermore, gingival inflammation and
plaque accumulation are involved in the development of periodontal disease, which has
been associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer. Thus, visits to the dentist
also allow the dental team to evaluate the patient’s oral hygiene practices and reinforce
self-performed plaque control.
Radiographs
Many oral diseases cannot be detected with a visual or physical exam. Dental x-rays can
help the dentist find cavities between teeth or under fillings, diagnose gum and bone
diseases and some types of tumors, and better plan surgical interventions. These images
can help detect and treat these hidden problems at an early stage before more extensive
treatment is necessary. Radiographs and other imaging modalities are used to diagnose
and monitor oral diseases, as well as to monitor dentofacial development and the progress
or prognosis of therapy. However, x-rays should only be taken when there is an
expectation that the additional information they can provide might result in improved
patient care. Thus, the dentist must weigh the benefits of a radiographic examination
against the risk of exposing a patient to x-rays, the effects of which accumulate from
multiple sources over time. Based on the patient’s health history and vulnerability to oral
disease, the dentist may make this assessment in the interest of each patient.

## Page 113

111
The American Dental Association and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have devised
recommendations for the selection of patients for dental radiographic examinations [14],
which can serve as a framework for dentists who treat FA patients. According to this
document, the dentist is advised to conduct a clinical examination, consider the patient’s
signs, symptoms, and oral and medical histories, as well as consider the patient’s age and
vulnerability to environmental factors that may affect oral health. This diagnostic and
evaluative information may determine the type of imaging to be used or the frequency of
its use.
Once the need for radiographs is determined, a conscious effort should be made by the
dentist to reduce the radiation risks of dental x-rays, including limiting the number of
radiographs, using protective gear (e.g., leaded aprons and thyroid collars), and using
faster speed films and digital imaging.
Radiation Exposure From Dental Radiographs
When taken properly, dental radiographs provide limited radiation exposure (Table 1). In
fact, natural sources of radiation can provide more radiation exposure than dental x-rays.
For instance, a panoramic dental x-ray exam may expose a patient to only about 1
millirem, whereas a cross-country flight exposes an individual to 5 millirem of cosmic
radiation. Moreover, the National Council on Radiation Protection estimates that the
average U.S. resident receives about 360 millirem of radiation every year. Exposure can be
minimized even further with the use of digital radiographs [15].

Restorative Dental Treatments
Fillings and Restorative Materials
Dental fillings can be used to restore function to teeth that have become damaged or
decayed. There are several dental filling materials available. Amalgam fillings, which are
made of mercury, silver, tin, copper, and other trace metals, have been used extensively for
many decades. Amalgam fillings are easy to place, strong, and have good longevity.
However, it remains unclear whether the mercury in amalgam fillings is harmful to health
[17]. Therefore, the use of amalgam fillings in patients with FA should be limited until
further research is available.
Tooth-colored, synthetic resins known as composite resins can be used as a restorative
material or adhesive. Composite resins are approved for use in all teeth and can replace
the use of amalgam in molar teeth. However, patients should be warned that composite
fillings are associated with an increased occurrence of secondary decay and tooth
sensitivity. Composite resins may be of potential concern for FA patients due to the
presence of bisphenol A (BPA), which may have endocrine-disrupting, estrogenic
properties. However, the potential harmful effects of BPA remain controversial and no
unacceptable risks for the patient have yet been recognized [18]. Furthermore, BPA
exposure can be reduced by cleaning and rinsing surfaces of sealants and composites
immediately after placement [19].
The best way to avoid the need for any restorative materials is to decrease the patient’s
risk for caries. This can be achieved by aiming for optimal oral hygiene at home, following
a balanced diet (low in sucrose), and having access to fluoride as appropriate.
Orthodontic Treatment
The use of braces to reposition the teeth should not pose a problem for patients with FA
who are not neutropenic or otherwise immunocompromised. However, the brackets and
wires on the braces can cause trauma and chronic inflammation in some patients. Because
chronic physical irritation has been reported to be associated with oral cancer in clinical
studies [20, 21], efforts should be made to prevent such irritation in FA patients. Recently,
new orthodontic treatment methods using clear aligners have been developed that
obviate the need for traditional brackets and wires in certain cases.
Dental Implants
Dental implants are titanium cylinders that are implanted into the jaw bone to replace
missing teeth. They act as artificial roots to hold crowns or dentures in place. It should be
noted that FA is not a contraindication for dental implants. A patient with FA should be
stable (i.e., non-immunocompromised and non-thrombocytopenic) and meet all the

## Page 115

113
routine requirements for implants, such as sufficient bone volume and the ability to
maintain good oral hygiene.
Oral Surgery
Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are involved in the diagnosis and management of
diseases, injuries, and defects of the oral and maxillofacial region. Common reasons to
visit the oral surgeon include tooth removal (including removal of the third molars),
treatment of dental infections, biopsy of oral lesions, or reconstruction with dental
implants. Patients also may need to see an oral surgeon for the treatment of trauma to the
oral region or facial bones. The majority of procedures can be safely and comfortably
done in the oral surgeon’s office, where sedation is often used. The sedation techniques
used in an oral surgery office are very similar to those used during an FA patient’s bone
marrow aspirate or biopsy. Patients with FA who are non-immunocompromised and non-
thrombocytopenic usually can be treated in a routine fashion. The oral surgeon may need
to consult with the patient's hematologist about any questions or concerns.

Oral Manifestations Associated with
Fanconi Anemia
Fanconi anemia can manifest in numerous ways in the oral cavity of patients with the
disease. Many of these manifestations also occur in healthy children, so it remains unclear
whether they are associated with FA itself or rather with treatments for bone marrow
failure (BMF), such as chemotherapy and radiation used during hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT), which are known to adversely affect the development of teeth and
jaws in children younger than 12 years. Regardless, it is important that FA patients be
evaluated for dental and skeletal developmental issues that include:
• Agenesis, microdentia, or micrognathia
• Supernumerary teeth or delayed development of permanent teeth
• Changes in the color of the tooth enamel or abnormal tooth shape, rotation or
position
• Delayed development of teeth (usually permanent teeth), including delayed loss of
primary teeth and eruption of permanent teeth compared with healthy peers
Oral Ulcers
Oral ulcers occur frequently in patients with FA and can cause anxiety due to the high risk
of oral cancer in these individuals. Oral ulcers or any oral lesions that do not resolve need
to be assessed by a health care professional. The most serious oral lesion associated with
FA is oral cancer (see Chapter 5).

## Page 116

114
It is extremely important for clinicians to differentiate between canker sores, ulcerations
caused by a condition known as aphthous stomatitis, and oral ulcerations due to other
potential causes.
Canker sores are lesions that often develop after a relatively mild trauma and heal within
approximately 4-7 days. Aphthous stomatitis is characterized by multiple ulcers that occur
simultaneously and can recur as often as once a month (just as the previous ulcers are
healing). Most cases of aphthous stomatitis can be treated with topical steroids applied
directly to the ulcer (Table 2).

Table 2. Management of recurrent ulcerations.
Treatment Dose and Treatment Schedule
Topical anesthetics 2% viscous lidocaine; doxepin solution
Topical coating agents Hydroxypropylcellulose film (Zilactin)
Topical corticosteroids 0.05% clobetasol gel; 0.05% flucinonide gel; 0.1 mg/ml
dexamethasone elixir; budesonide inhaler
Intralesional injection 40 mg/ml triamcinolone (0.1 - 0.3 ml)
Systemic therapy 0.5-1 mg/kg prednisone; thalidomide

Neutropenic Mouth Ulcers
Patients who have neutropenia can develop oral ulcers that are clinically indistinguishable
from canker sores. Such neutropenic ulcers can develop spontaneously or after a mild
trauma (such as a mild bite injury), but tend to worsen and become painful. Neutropenic
ulcers can be an early indication of bone marrow diseases, such as aplastic anemia or
leukemia, though additional systemic signs and symptoms of bone marrow disease often
will be present. Additionally, cancer therapies such as chemotherapy can cause severe
neutropenia and neutropenic ulcerations.
Viral-Induced Mouth Ulcers
Recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can cause ulcerations of the oral mucosa
and lip. These lesions often are associated with the immune dysfunction that often
accompanies severe aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and leukemia. The
lesions also can arise after high-dose chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplant
(HCT).

Oral Health Problems Associated with Bone
Marrow Failure
Bone marrow failure (BMF) contributes to significant oral health problems including
increased bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, gum enlargement, bleeding, pain and
other facial neuropathies. Table 3 describes the underlying causes of these oral health
issues in patients with FA and provides recommendations for management.

Oral Care Before and After Hematopoietic Cell
Transplant
The treatment and management of BMF can result in a wide spectrum of oral
complications for patients with FA. Preventing and controlling oral complications can
improve the patient’s quality of life and, in many instances, potentially improve the
patient’s treatment outcomes.
Pre-Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Oral Examination
Prior to treatment for BMF with HCT, patients should undergo a complete oral
examination and dental evaluation. Dental care should focus on eliminating any oral and
dental diseases that could contribute to oral complications during treatment. Teeth with a
poor long-term prognosis due to periodontal disease and/or teeth deemed to be non-
restorable should be extracted. In situations where extractions are not possible due to the
patient’s medical status, time-release antibiotics can be placed in deep periodontal
pockets to reduce the levels of bacteria in the region for several weeks and, thus,
hopefully reduce the risk of periodontal infections.
Patients must be informed of the potential oral complications of HCT, including the
causes, prevention, and management of the complications. Patients must accept
responsibility for maintaining the highest level of oral hygiene and adhering to protocols
to reduce the risk of oral complications from BMF and HCT.
Post-Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Oral Care
Routine oral care after HCT is essential to help maintain oral health and prevent infections
and bleeding problems associated with gingivitis and periodontal disease. Once dental
examinations resume after HCT, the dentist should carefully examine the patient’s teeth
and periodontal tissues, and x-ray images should be obtained if pre-transplant images are
not available. However, routine elective dental treatment, including dental cleanings and
restorations, should wait until the patient’s immune system has sufficiently recovered.
If a patient urgently needs dental treatment before the immune system has recovered, the
dentist and physician should determine what additional supportive medical care is
needed. Supportive care may include prophylactic antibiotics, immunoglobulin G
administration, adjustment of steroid doses, and platelet transfusions if the patient has a
significant risk for bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotic regimens appear to be efficacious, with
regimens being extended if there is ongoing dental infection or if there is concern for
delayed healing. Dentists should minimize the spray from dental equipment by using
rubber dams and high-volume suction devices to reduce the chances that a patient
recovering from HCT will inhale any infectious or dangerous substances during dental

## Page 119

treatment. The dental care team also should aim to reduce the complexity of treatments
and shorten treatment times.

Summary
Patients with FA have an increased risk of developing head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Several studies have highlighted
the role of adequate oral hygiene in preventing HNSCC and although
the evidence is not yet conclusive, it is recommended that all FA
patients follow best practices for oral care and evaluation. All FA
patients, including pediatric and adult, should be evaluated by a
dental professional every six months. Oral examination for HNSCC
should start no later than age 10 (see Chapter 5). Patients with FA are
encouraged to develop excellent oral hygiene practices at home,
which include twice daily brushing, removal of plaque between the
teeth, and avoidance of toothpastes with triclosan or hydrogen
peroxide and mouth washes with alcohol. Digital radiographs used
for routine dental evaluations do not increase the risk of cancer and
support comprehensive dental care for dental caries or additional
oral issues common to FA patients. The oral health of FA patients
undergoing HCT should be closely monitored before and after
transplant.

Chapter 7
Gynecologic Care for Female
Patients with Fanconi Anemia

Introduction
Patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) now have a high likelihood of
reaching reproductive age due to advancements in clinical care that
have increased life expectancy. As patients with FA reach young
adulthood, gender-specific health concerns should be monitored
and treated. This chapter provides an overview of clinical problems
female patients with FA may face during their reproductive lifetime.
These issues include pubertal delay, irregular menarche, primary
ovarian insufficiency, early onset of menopause, reduced fertility
and reproductive lifespan, and gynecologic cancer. Clinical care
guidelines for gynecologic complications that can occur during and
after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) also are discussed.

Puberty and Menarche
Approximately 9 out of every 10 healthy women experience menarche within three years
after breast buds develop, which typically occurs as early as age 11 and before age 16.
Most female patients with FA undergo puberty within a normal age range; however, some
may experience pubertal delay or not have menarche until their mid-teens. Pubertal delay
is defined as breast bud development that is delayed to age 13, or age 14 for individuals

## Page 122

120
who have low body weight [1, 2]. Pubertal delay in female patients with FA may result from
low body mass index or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) performed during childhood.
Female patients with FA who have no breast development by age 13 or have not started
their periods within three years after breast buds develop (by age 15) should be evaluated
for hypothalamic dysfunction [1-3]. As discussed in Chapter 10, many female patients with
FA experience other endocrine disorders including hypothyroidism and hypothalamic
dysfunction [4]. Hypothyroidism, if unrecognized and untreated, may contribute to
irregular periods and infertility. Hypothalamic hypogonadism is associated with delayed
puberty, amenorrhea, and infertility [3]. If puberty is delayed or does not occur, patients
may need hormonal supplementation to optimize growth [4-6].
Menorrhagia
Female patients with FA may experience menorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding, as a
result of thrombocytopenia or anovulatory cycles. Menorrhagia can cause anemia and
present the need for a blood transfusion. In addition, for female FA patients with normal
menses who also have severe anemia, it may be beneficial to suppress menses to limit any
blood loss that may worsen anemia. Female FA patients who experience heavy menstrual
bleeding should undergo a complete blood count. An ultrasound can be performed to rule
out other potential causes of excessive menstrual bleeding, such as polyps or submucosal
fibroids that form in the lining of the uterus.

Gynecologic Issues Associated with
Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
Menstrual Suppression
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) regimens typically result in severe anemia and
thrombocytopenia; therefore, menstrual suppression is typically recommended for female
patients with FA during HCT. Ideally, medications that suppress menstrual bleeding should
be initiated one to two months prior to HCT to increase the likelihood that menstruation
will cease by the time of the HCT. Options for menses suppression in FA patients include
reproductive hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and a class of drugs known as
gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists [7]. Estrogen-containing medications
increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, and, depending on the patient’s diagnosis or
treatment regimen, estrogen-containing medication may be contraindicated.  Leuprolide
acetate, a type of GnRH agonist, has been shown to be effective in inducing ovarian
hormone suppression in female patients scheduled for HCT [8-11]. Patients who are being
treated with leuprolide acetate to reduce excessive menstrual bleeding also can take
additional oral hormone (“add-back” therapy, usually with the progestin norethindrone) to

## Page 123

121
manage any menopausal symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis, which is associated with
long-term (i.e., more than 6 months) exposure to leuprolide acetate and other GnRH
agonists [5].
Genital Graft-Versus-Host Disease
Female patients with FA who have undergone HCT may experience graft-versus-host
disease (GvHD) (see Chapter 3) in the anogenital area. The wide range in reported
incidence of vulvovaginal GvHD of 3-49% suggests that the true rate is likely unknown [12,
13]. Symptoms include vulvovaginal pain or itching, dysuria, dyspareunia, difficulty with
tampon insertion, or postcoital bleeding. Exam findings include vulvar skin erythema and
pain on gentle touching, with specific diagnostic mucosal changes (termed lichen planus-
like or lichen sclerosis-like features), fissures, erosions, vulvar or vaginal scarring, including
loss of the normal vulvar appearance (including vulvar folds). Topical therapies, including
steroids and immune modulators, estrogen vaginal rings and dilators, are the mainstays of
treatment [14]. Genital exams for female FA patients who have undergone HCT should
include examination for the above findings and to distinguish genital GvHD from other
conditions, including genital HPV-related disease [12, 15].

Primary Ovarian Insufficiency
On average, menopause typically is diagnosed around age 51 for women in the U.S.
Menopause that occurs prior to age 40 is considered premature. By contrast, most female
patients with FA experience primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) by their early 30s. The
medical diagnosis of POI is sometimes referred to as “premature menopause.” In POI, also
described as decreased ovarian reserve, ovarian function can be intermittent. Up to 10% of
women with POI experience spontaneous conception. Primary ovarian insufficiency is a
spectrum of low ovarian reserve, declining ovarian function, reduced fertility, and estrogen
deficiency. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels measured twice, two months apart,
and persistently elevated levels along with irregular menses confirm a POI diagnosis. In
girls who underwent gonadotoxic therapy prior to menarche (e.g., in HCT regimens), an
absence or arrest of pubertal development together with elevated FSH are indicative of
POI. The two main functions of the ovary are to produce the hormones estrogen and
progesterone and to release mature oocytes for fertility. In patients with POI, both of these
functions are affected.
From a hormone production standpoint, any female FA patient who underwent
gonadotoxic therapy prior to or after puberty should be monitored for POI. For pre-
pubertal patients, FSH should be measured annually until it is determined whether
hormone therapy is indicated to start pubertal development. This monitoring typically is
done in consultation with an endocrinologist. Hormone therapy for pubertal development

## Page 124

122
is comprised of incremental hormone doses during which height (the normal pubertal
“growth spurt”) also is monitored. For patients who have not undergone gonadotoxic
therapy and who are post-pubertal, clinically monitoring for menstrual pattern and
periodic monitoring of FSH is suggested.
Hormone Therapy
Optimal hormonal treatment of female FA patients diagnosed with POI serves to replace
the hormones that would be produced by the ovary before menopause, making treatment
distinctly different from hormonal therapy for menopause that focuses on menopausal
symptoms. Two types of hormone therapy can be administered to female FA patients who
have POI until they reach age 50: oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) or postmenopausal
hormone therapy (also known as hormone therapy, HT), which consists of low to
physiologic doses of estrogen and progestins. Either approach to HT is superior to no
therapy regarding the effects on bone and other aspects of health [16, 17]. Many clinicians
and the American College of Obstetricians (ACOG) favor recommendations of
postmenopausal regimens with enough estrogen (slightly higher doses) to maintain bone
health [17, 18]. Large studies comparing various doses and types of HT for hormonal
contraception have not been undertaken. Given their young age of onset with POI, female
FA patients may benefit from taking oral contraceptives rather than HT to prevent
pregnancy. The dose in HT is lower and, thus, may not be effective in preventing
pregnancy. This is an opportunity for shared decision-making regarding the use of oral
contraceptives versus menopausal hormone therapy for optimal bone health.
Furthermore, oral contraceptives given to premenopausal women protect against ovarian
cancer and likely have a minimal impact on the risk of breast cancer in the general
population as well as in patients with variants in the FANCS/BRCA1 and FANCD1/BRCA2
genes [16, 19]. Whether the same protective effect of oral contraceptives occurs in
individuals with POI or FA who have variants in the FANCD1/BRCA2 gene is unknown [20,
21].
Women in the general population who experience POI and do not use HT tend to have
higher rates of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke, general illness and death
compared with those who take hormones [22]. It also is not clear that the risks of HT
described in postmenopausal women are the same for women with POI who are replacing
and receiving physiologic levels of hormone. Therefore, HT should be recommended for
female FA patients who have POI and are not using contraceptives. The goals of HT in POI
include levels that maintain bone, cardiovascular, and sexual health [16]. Hormone
therapy also remains the most effective treatment for the symptoms of menopause (Tables
1 and 2).

Findings from the Women’s Health Initiative, an ongoing study of health issues in
postmenopausal women, initially reported that HT was associated with a slightly
increased risk of breast cancer and increased risks of heart attack, stroke, and
thromboembolic disease while it protected against bone loss [33]. However, recent re-
evaluation of these study data suggests that continuous estrogen treatment alone either
decreases or has no effect on breast cancer risk [34]. These observations may not apply to
all estrogen preparations since not all estrogens have been studied and the type of
estrogen studied may have protective effects on the breast. Importantly, only those
women who have undergone hysterectomy are candidates for estrogen-only therapy, and
combination therapy with estrogen and progestins resulted in a slightly increased risk of
breast cancer. However, as stated above, these risks were observed in postmenopausal
women and are not thought to apply to younger women with POI.
Bone Density
Most children and adolescents with FA have a normal bone mineral density when the
results are adjusted for stature [35]; however, female patients with FA may have low bone
density due to the side effects of HCT treatment. Individuals who undergo POI before peak
bone mass at age 30 and who do not use hormone therapy are at risk for bone fractures
and may develop osteoporosis with further bone loss. There are many osteoporosis
treatment options, including drugs known as bisphosphonates including alendronate and
risederonate, which prevent bone resorption, and hormones (estrogen and raloxifene),
which build bone. Patients who cannot tolerate oral medications or who are resistant to
other treatments may benefit from infusions of zoledronic acid or teriparatide. To prevent

## Page 127

125
bone loss, most postmenopausal FA patients, including those with POI, should take
calcium (1200-1500 mg daily) and vitamin D (400-800 IU daily) supplements. Many women
are deficient in vitamin D, possibly due in part to the use of sunscreen, which can reduce
the amount of vitamin D that the body produces in response to sunlight exposure. Vitamin
D levels can be tested to determine whether supplementation is needed.
Sexual Health
It is important for clinicians to screen for and address sexual health concerns because
sexuality is an important aspect of quality of life. Primary ovarian insufficiency can be
accompanied by many symptoms that can impair a woman’s sexual function, including hot
flashes, vaginal dryness, and dyspareunia (suggested hormonal treatments for these
symptoms are discussed above and shown in Tables 1 and 2). Conditions related to prior
treatments, such as vulvovaginal GvHD, also can impact sexual function.
Treatment for sexual dysfunction is individualized to the patient. Hormone therapy and
many non-hormone options exist for managing menopausal symptoms (a sample of
available options can be found in Tables 1 and 2). For patients with POI, topical estrogen
therapy may be needed in addition to systemic HT for the genitourinary symptoms of
menopause. Vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse also can be treated with over-
the-counter products including long-acting moisturizers, lubricants, vitamin E capsules and
suppositories, and vaginal hyaluronic acid [36-38]. Patients with POI or vulvovaginal GvHD
also may need management with vaginal dilators if vaginal stenosis is present. Physical
therapy, including pelvic floor physical therapy, also may be appropriate for some
patients. In addition, women with chronic medical conditions may be at increased risk of
depression, body image concerns, or social isolation, which also can impact sexual
function. Mental health and/or relationship concerns relative to sexual dysfunction are
best addressed, as appropriate, with a psychologist, psychiatrist, or a sexual health
therapist.

Reproductive Lifespan, Fertility, and Pregnancy
Female patients with FA may be able to have children, but they often experience reduced
fertility and a shortened reproductive lifespan due to delayed menarche, early
menopause, and reduced fertility [4, 6, 39, 40].
Some factors that affect fertility and reproductive health in female FA patients include:
• Early menopause
• Infrequent menstrual periods (oligomenorrhea)
• Absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea)
• Radiation and chemotherapy prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)

## Page 128

126
Contraception
Contraceptive counseling is a central part of gynecologic care for sexually active FA
patients who do not desire pregnancy; this counseling includes patients with a diagnosis of
POI, as unpredictable, random ovulation can occur in these patients resulting in a 5-10%
chance of spontaneous pregnancy. If female FA patients of reproductive age are sexually
active and pregnancy is not desired, use of contraception is advised and missing a
menstrual period warrants pregnancy testing [41]. Oral contraceptive pills also can be
prescribed to improve menstrual regularity in patients with irregular periods.
Contraceptive counseling of patients with FA also provides an opportunity to emphasize
the importance of safe sex practices and screening for sexually transmitted infection (STI)
[42] and vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) (see page 129 of this chapter for
more details).
Fertility and Pregnancy Rates
Pregnancies have been reported in female patients with FA, both those who were treated
with HCT and those who were not [39, 40]. In all reports, very few FA patients become
pregnant after age 30; most childbearing in FA patients occurs by the mid-20s. Some
women with FA whose pregnancies occurred at older ages may have more mild forms of
FA and appear unaffected until worsening anemia related to FA is diagnosed during
pregnancy [43].
Most information about fertility in female patients with FA who have not undergone HCT is
compiled from case reports, which suggest that these women have a low pregnancy rate,
ranging from 15% among women on androgen therapy to 29% for women not taking
androgens [39]. This low fertility rate is supported by animal models of FA [6]. Women who
conceive while taking androgens should immediately discontinue androgen therapy to
minimize the risk of masculinizing a female fetus.
Regarding pregnancy after HCT, among 101 female patients with FA over age 16 years
who underwent HCT during a 30-year period, only 10 patients (10%) conceived and all
infants were delivered prior to age 26 [40]. Of those 10 patients, four had two infants each.
Five of these patients showed at least transient signs of gonadal failure prior to pregnancy.
In this study, the median age at transplant was 12 years and pregnancies occurred 4-17
years after HCT [40]. This pregnancy rate is somewhat higher than pregnancy rates
reported after HCT across the transplant population in general. This higher rate may be
due to the lower radiation and chemotherapy doses received by female FA patients and
their relatively younger age at transplant.
Monitoring for Primary Ovarian Insufficiency and Infertility
Reproductive endocrinologists and other clinicians currently evaluate anti-müllerian
hormone (AMH) as a marker of “ovarian reserve,” or an estimate of the number of

## Page 129

127
immature follicles that later may be able to become mature oocytes. Anti-müllerian
hormone is made by the small, immature follicles in the ovary and does not vary over the
menstrual cycle, but slowly declines over a woman’s reproductive life. In one study of
female patients with FA, the AMH level was extremely low in all patients over age 25,
which reflects the known low fertility and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in these
women [44]. Additionally, chemotherapy treatment has been shown to at least temporarily
lower AMH levels [45]. Considering these observations, measuring AMH values over time
may allow opportunity for female patients with FA to seek fertility preservation treatments
before or when decreasing AMH levels are detected, prior to the onset of POI.
Risks to Fertility and Methods of Fertility Preservation
Female patients with FA have low fertility in general and some treatments involving
chemotherapy or pelvic radiation may further impair future fertility. In particular, HCT
regimens typically require pre-transplant chemotherapy and radiation that pose a
significant risk of infertility. In February 2013, the Ethics Committee of the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine issued guidelines for fertility preservation and
reproduction in cancer patients [46]. The most important take-home message from these
guidelines is that physicians should inform patients about the options for fertility
preservation prior to the start of therapies that are gonadotoxic. The known risks of
infertility and of POI in female FA patients has led to consideration of elective oocyte or
embryo cryopreservation before primary ovarian insufficiency occurs.
Cryopreservation of both embryos and eggs has an excellent success rate and may be
considered whenever it is clinically available and medically feasible. The process of
embryo or egg cryopreservation requires a month or longer. In cancer treatment settings,
it does not appear to compromise timely cancer treatment or increase the risk of mortality
[47, 48]. However, the patient’s medical status and the urgency to complete the next steps
in treatment (for example, initiating urgent therapy for a cancer diagnosis) remain the
rate-limiting issues. New assisted reproduction protocols are enabling a shorter time to
oocyte retrieval.
Other realistic options to achieve motherhood should be discussed with patients, including
donor eggs, adoption, and surrogacy. Several options are being actively pursued, including
gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists [9], which currently are used to suppress menses
and additionally may protect the ovaries from the gonadotoxic effects of radiation and
chemotherapy, and ovarian tissue cryopreservation [22]. However, proven methods of
fertility preservation are preferred over experimental options.
Some parents of children with FA explore the use of assisted reproductive technologies
such as in vitro fertilization with embryo selection and tissue matching to conceive
additional children who do not have FA. These children may be able to provide stem cells
to assist with the early treatment of their sibling with FA (see Chapter 3). As part of assisted

## Page 130

128
reproductive technologies, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can be performed to
identify the FA status of the embryos and implant only those that are FA-negative (see
Chapter 2). If PGD is not available, amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be
used to determine the FA status of a fetus during pregnancy.
Risks During Pregnancy and Childbirth
When a female patient with FA does conceive regardless of whether she has undergone
HCT, a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine should work closely with the patient’s
hematologist. Pregnancy risks vary based on a woman’s current health status, prior
diagnoses, and prior treatments; however, some risks may be common to all female FA
patients.
In women who have not undergone HCT, the largest case series found that blood cell
counts significantly decreased during pregnancy in more than half of the female patients
with FA; this decrease was associated with thrombocytopenia and the need for blood
transfusions, but did not increase the mother’s risk of death [39]. In contrast, similar rates
of transfusion and an increased mortality risk were seen in female patients with other
types of aplastic anemia, a condition that occurs when the bone marrow does not produce
enough blood cells [39]. Compared with female patients in the general population,
patients with FA who had not undergone HCT had a higher rate of pregnancy
complications, such as pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and spontaneous abortions [39]. In this
same study, female patients with FA had a higher rate of caesarean section than their
healthy peers, which was attributed to the short stature and small pelvises of the FA
patients; the patients with FA also had a higher rate of failure to progress during labor [39].

Gynecologic Cancers
High rates of lower genital tract squamous cell cancers (SCC), including cervical, vaginal,
vulvar, and anal cancers, have been reported in female patients with FA. Patients who have
undergone HCT—especially those who developed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (see
Chapter 3)—have a higher risk of SCC compared with patients who have not undergone
HCT [49, 50]. On average, female patients with FA tend to develop cervical and vulvar
cancer at ages 25 and 27, respectively, whereas women in the general population tend to
develop cervical cancer at age 47 and vulvar cancer at age 72 [51-53]. This age difference
means that young female patients with FA have a several thousand-fold higher risk for
vulvar cancer and at least a 100-fold higher risk for cervical cancer compared with young
women in the general population [51-53]. Because of this, FA testing should be considered
in any patient who is diagnosed with cervical cancer prior to age 30 or vulvar cancer prior
to age 40.

Human Papillomavirus and Gynecologic Cancer in Patients with
Fanconi Anemia
In individuals with FA, detection of HPV in primary anogenital or head and neck squamous
cell cancers was high in one study [54], and low in vulvar or absent in the head and neck
cancers in two other studies [55, 56]. Importantly, others reported high rates of HPV
detected in oral rinses in adults and children [57, 58] and laboratory studies have shown
that the loss of FA pathway components in mucosal and skin cells stimulates proliferation
of HPV lesions (via HPV genome amplification). These studies provide some evidence that
an intact FA pathway functions to limit the HPV life cycle [59]. The variable prevalence of
HPV in squamous cell cancers, high rates of HPV in oral rinses from a wide age range of
individuals with FA, and insights into the important role the FA pathway serves in
controlling HPV together illustrate that our current understanding of the role of HPV in FA-
related tumors is incomplete and indicate that further research is needed. The
discrepancies in the role of HPV may be due to many factors, including differences in the
amount of virus in the individuals studied, geographic differences in the prevalence of HPV
infection, or differences in the mode of squamous cell cancer development among
individuals with FA. Testing for HPV in female FA patients can be performed at the same
time as the Pap test, although the absence of high-risk HPV types in patients with FA
should not change the screening interval. Individuals with genital tract squamous
intraepithelial lesion (SIL) also may require anal cytology, anoscopy, and lesion biopsy to
identify anal SIL and cancers.
Recommendations for Vaccination Against Human Papillomavirus
Current guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommend routine HPV vaccination of both females and males [60]. There are many
different types of HPV; the current vaccine protects against acquiring the nine HPV types
that are most commonly associated with cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers, and genital
warts. The vaccine is available for ages 9-45 years [61]; ideally, the vaccine should be given
before the patient has ever been exposed to HPV through sexual intercourse. Three doses
of the vaccine are recommended for healthy individuals age 15 years and older. For
healthy individuals age 9-14 years old, only two doses of the vaccine are recommended to
achieve the same immune response [62]. The long-term effectiveness of HPV vaccination is
unknown, but studies have shown that the vaccine immunity continues for at least 10 years
in healthy individuals [62]. Because female patients with FA have an increased risk of
squamous cell cancers of the lower genital tract, it is strongly recommended that they
receive HPV vaccination starting at age 9. Recent small, cross-sectional studies of
individuals with FA after HPV vaccination showed a similar, durable response compared to
studies in healthy volunteers, suggesting that female FA patients will respond to
vaccination [63, 64]. It currently is unknown whether patients with FA who receive the
vaccination will require all three doses of vaccine in the series or booster vaccinations

## Page 132

130
later in life. Although the HPV vaccines will not treat or cure existing HPV-related disease,
they may prevent the acquisition of HPV types not currently present. Because the HPV
vaccines do not prevent all lower genital tract cancers observed in female FA patients,
vaccinated women should undergo regular gynecologic screening, including Pap test. Re-
vaccination (or vaccination) against HPV after transplantation is advised, as this will
decrease the risk of acquiring HPV after HCT and may reduce the occurrence of HPV-
related disease, which, in turn, may help to minimize the risk of secondary cancers [65].
Female FA patients vaccinated after HCT have similar immune responses to those who
have not undergone HCT and healthy women [63, 64].
Gynecologic Cancer Surveillance
Early detection of precancerous lesions in individuals with FA is imperative to maximize
survival. There is ongoing debate regarding the gynecologic cancer-screening schedule for
female patients with FA. While it is important to be vigilant, it is equally important not to
overburden patients by subjecting them to extra testing, anxiety while awaiting results,
and potentially unnecessary procedures. With that understanding, and because these
patients have a high risk for early vulvar cancer and pubertal delay, female FA patients
should begin receiving gynecologic cancer screening at a younger age than is typically
recommended for women in the general population. Female FA patients should begin
having visual examinations of the external genitalia at age 13. Sexually active FA patients,
and all women with FA who are 18 years or older, should undergo regular, comprehensive
gynecologic exams, including a Pap test and a careful inspection of the cervix, vagina, and
vulva. As a comparison, current guidelines for women without FA recommend beginning
Pap testing at age 21 years [66].
Recommendations for Colposcopy and Biopsy
Colposcopy of the vulva, vagina, or cervix should be performed when any abnormal areas
are seen on visual inspection or if a cervical cytology test is abnormal. Lesions that are
identified during colposcopy or routine examination should be biopsied promptly.
Clinicians should biopsy even those lesions with a benign appearance, as malignant
lesions may have an atypical appearance and biopsy is the only way to exclude
precancerous disease needing treatment or cancer. Any female patient with FA who is
diagnosed with squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL, a precancerous condition that
increases the risk of developing cancer) should undergo gynecologic exams with biopsy of
any identified lesions every four to six months.
Female patients with FA and clinicians may find increased challenges with Pap tests and
colposcopy. There may be a higher rate of “Unsatisfactory for evaluation” Pap test results
due to insufficient cells, likely related to hypoestrogenism from primary ovarian
insufficiency. Hypoestrogenism-associated vaginal atrophy also may cause increased
discomfort with speculum exams in these patients. This discomfort can be minimized if

clinicians undertake examinations using either pediatric-sized or very narrow speculums,
even in adult patients, and additionally lubricate the speculum with warm water or a thin
coating of gel-based lubricant. Procedures under anesthesia may be appropriate for select
patients.
With these challenges in mind, clinicians need to weigh the risks and benefits of strict
adherence to the above Pap test and colposcopy guidelines, which are based on expert
opinion and, at times, develop an individualized follow-up schedule that accomplishes
long-term screening goals. For example, for patients whose Pap test results are
“Unsatisfactory,” current American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology
guidelines recommend a repeat Pap test in 2-4 months; however, for a female FA patient
with otherwise normal-appearing external genitalia and speculum exam, a slightly longer
interval may be desirable, particularly if an intervention such as vaginal estrogen is
initiated to treat hypoestrogenism or if sedation is required to obtain the Pap test. The
risks and benefits of colposcopy for a patient with a visually normal cervix and genital
tract and a Pap test result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
(ASCUS) that is HPV negative, is an opportunity for shared decision-making regarding the
options of colposcopic evaluation versus increased frequency of Pap tests for surveillance.
Surgical Treatment of Gynecologic Cancer
The optimal treatment for genital warts or SIL is surgical excision or ablation. Vulvar
lesions also may be treated with immune modulating drugs, such as imiquimod, 5-
fluorouracil (5-FU), or alpha interferon [67, 68]. The patient’s genital area should be
inspected periodically during immune modulator treatment to determine whether the
treatment is working and to identify any adverse side effects. Patients with FA who have
extensive vulvar SIL may benefit from a combination of surgical and medical treatment as
reported in other patient populations [69]. Patients with other immune deficiencies
typically respond to immune modulators within a few weeks, and thus female FA patients
may benefit from long-term immune modulator treatment due to the likelihood of
recurrent or refractory SIL. Patients diagnosed with genital tract cancer should be referred
to a gynecologic oncologist immediately.

Breast Cancer Screening in Patients with Fanconi
Anemia
Five of the genes implicated in Fanconi anemia (FA) are breast cancer susceptibility genes
(see Chapter 2): FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C, and
FANCS/BRCA1. Breast cancer risk for individuals with FA who harbor variants in these
genes or other FA genes has not been established; therefore, more research is needed to

## Page 134

132
develop guidelines for breast cancer screening for female patients with FA (regardless of
their specific FA variant).
Screening for women in the general population who are carriers of variants in the
FANCD1/BRCA2 and FANCS/BRCA1 genes starts with annual breast exams and annual
breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination starting at age 25 years. Imaging is
increased in frequency at age 30 years to twice a year and includes clinical breast
examinations and mammography alternating with MRI [70]. In some instances, both
mammography and MRI are performed at the same time, either annually or semi-annually.
Ultrasound is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in conjunction with
mammography, particularly for women with dense breasts [71-73].
It is unclear whether the mammography screening recommendations apply to individuals
with FA, as they have an elevated sensitivity to radiation exposure due to their underlying
genetic defects in DNA repair. The long-term risks of radiation exposure must be weighed
against the benefits of early detection [74]. Magnetic resonance imaging can reduce
radiation exposure for patients with FA and is very sensitive for detecting breast tumors
that may be missed by other screening techniques. However, MRI cannot definitively
classify tumors as benign or malignant and has a high false-positive rate; therefore, this
technique is usually used in conjunction with mammography [70]. A study that evaluated
the use of MRI for breast cancer screening found that scans of premenopausal women had
high background enhancement regardless of timing within the menstrual cycle, resulting
in a high rate of false-positive cancer diagnoses; however, the diagnostic criteria for
suspicious lesions remained the same regardless of the increased false-positive rate [75].
Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be more sensitive for detecting tumors in patients
who have undergone menopause, even in those on hormone therapy, which causes the
breast tissue to become less dense [76, 77]. In the future, MRI may be preferred over
mammography in post-menopausal patients with FA as a way to minimize radiation
exposure from mammograms [78]; however, this approach has not been studied in the FA
population.

Summary
Female patients with FA face gynecologic issues including late onset
of puberty, abnormal menstrual bleeding, primary ovarian
insufficiency, cancer, and reduced fertility. Gynecologic care for
female patients with FA should cover the spectrum of these
complications and focus heavily on cancer screening. Gynecologic
assessment for pubertal delay and genital lesions for female FA
patients should begin at age 13 with complete vulvovaginal
examinations and Pap testing once the patient becomes sexually
active or by age 18. Screening for gynecologic cancer should be
performed every 6–12 months with immediate referral to a
gynecologic oncologist when gynecologic cancerous lesions are
confirmed by biopsy. Surgical resection is currently the best curative
option for gynecologic cancers in FA patients; therefore, early
detection is imperative. There are currently no consensus guidelines
for breast cancer screening in patients with FA; more research is
needed to define the risk for breast cancer in patients with FA.

Chapter 8
Dermatologic Issues in
Patients with Fanconi Anemia

Introduction
This chapter describes the most common skin problems that affect
patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) that result directly from the
disease or treatments associated with the disease. Skin
abnormalities, such as altered skin pigmentation, can be the
presenting symptoms of Fanconi anemia (FA). Patients with FA who
undergo hematopoietic cell transplants (HCT) also can develop
skin abnormalities that result from graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)
that occurs in the skin. The risk of developing skin cancer may be
increased for adult FA patients due to the DNA repair defects
associated with the disease, making early education on sun
protection and skin cancer prevention essential. Guidelines for
screening and treating warts, actinic keratosis, and cutaneous
cancers including basal and squamous cell carcinoma and
melanoma are also discussed.

Appearance of Skin in Patients with Fanconi
Anemia
Pigmentation Changes
Changes to pigment are the skin abnormalities most commonly associated with a
diagnosis of Fanconi anemia (FA) (see Chapter 2). A patient with FA can develop either
hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, typically in sun-exposed areas [1, 2]. Hyper- and
hypo-pigmented patches of skin can appear on the neck, trunk, and tops of hands and feet;
they also can appear on under arms, genitals, hand palms, or foot soles (Figure 1).
Differently colored areas of skin often overlap and can create a freckled appearance:
raindrop-like, light-colored patches of skin scattered over darker areas. Some patients also
appear to have a dusky or shadow-like skin tone, most notably in joint areas, lower
extremities, and on the neck. Smooth-bordered, tan patches of skin (café au lait macules)
also are common. Patients with FA also may be prone to easy bruising due to low blood
cell counts, which can present in the skin as small (petechiae) or large (purpura) areas of
bruising and may cause locally increased pigmentation as these areas heal [3].
Testing for FA should be considered in young children with distinct hyper- and/or hypo-
pigmented discoloration, or café au lait macules and accompanying disorders suggestive
of FA (see Chapter 2). While some FA patients develop skin abnormalities, others do not;
and such abnormalities are not unique to individuals with FA. The hypopigmented patches
in patients with FA are found also in syndromes such as neurofibromatosis and tuberous
sclerosis. Café au lait macules are a relatively common birthmark on patients with
neurofibromatosis. For cosmetic appearances, some hyperpigmented lesions such as café
au lait macules may be removed by laser treatments.

Figure 1. A patient with Fanconi anemia and pigmentary changes in skin.

## Page 143

141
Sweet’s Syndrome
Patients with FA may develop Sweet’s syndrome (SS), also called acute neutrophilic
dermatosis, which presents as red plaques or nodules on the skin (Figure 2), which may be
painful. As many as 12% of all FA patients develop SS, according to one report [4]. The
syndrome frequently develops many years after a patient has been diagnosed with FA.
Fever typically accompanies the red skin plaques or nodules, and similar lesions may be
present in a patient’s bones, lungs, or gastrointestinal tract.
Sweet’s syndrome lesions are mistaken often for sites of active infection and treated as
such; however, when these plaques are biopsied they show no sign of infection and heal
very poorly. Providers should consider the possibility of SS in patients with FA who have
red skin lesions that do not respond to antibiotics. Because FA patients can develop SS
lesions below the skin, radiographic imaging may be necessary to diagnose the condition.
Of note, patients with FA who develop SS also tend to have a high incidence of
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which either
precedes or follows shortly after the diagnosis of SS. When SS is diagnosed along with
characteristic hematologic or skeletal abnormalities, providers should consider a
diagnosis of FA. Patients with FA who develop SS should undergo a bone marrow
aspiration and biopsy to evaluate the possibility of evolution to MDS or AML.

syndrome.

Skin Growths Associated with Fanconi Anemia
Scaly raised skin growths in patients with FA may be warts (verruca vulgaris), basal cell
carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), actinic keratosis (AK), or other types of

## Page 144

142
lesions. Clinical care providers should carefully monitor all skin growths for changes over
time during annual whole body skin examinations.
Non-Cancerous Skin Growths
Patients with FA often have unusually high levels of warts, which may signal a decrease or
abnormality in cell-mediated immunity as warts can be initiated by human papillomavirus
(HPV) infection [1]. Warts can be treated using cryotherapy or various other topical agents.
Actinic keratosis, a non-cancerous growth, presents as flat pink or red scaly patches and
may progress to SCC.
Skin Cancers
Ultraviolet (UV) rays emitted by the sun can have multiple damaging effects on the skin,
some of which may be heightened in FA patients. Ultraviolet rays induce DNA damage,
which increases the potential for skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC),
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma over time [5]. This risk is underscored by
the fact that UV rays can be immunosuppressive in the skin, and immune surveillance is
critical for the prevention of skin cancer. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun has different
subtypes: Ultraviolet A (UVA) causes premature aging and wrinkling of the skin; Ultraviolet
B (UVB) induces DNA damage, such as double-strand breaks, and is the major cause of skin
cancer. Individuals with FA have a decreased ability to repair the types of DNA damage
induced by UVB (Chapter 1) and therefore have increased potential vulnerability to the
damaging effects of UVB and potential to develop BCC and SCC [6].
Basal and Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Basal cell carcinoma manifests typically as shiny, waxy, pearly red or pink bumps that
grow slowly with low metastatic potential. Cutaneous SCC appears as red, thick, scaly,
tender patches of skin that are highly metastatic, especially when localized on the head or
neck. Individuals who are immunocompromised have an increased risk of developing SCC.
In a young FA patient, multiple scaly lesions are likely to be warts. In an older adolescent
or adult, providers should perform a biopsy to determine whether the lesion is AK, BCC, or
SCC.
Dermatologists commonly use surgery to remove skin cancers, although photodynamic
therapy (PDT) can be used to treat BCC, SCC, and AK. Other skin cancer therapies used in
the general population include topical chemotherapy agents such as 5-Fluorouracil and/or
drugs that stimulate the immune system to target precancerous lesions or cancer. The
tolerability and efficacy of these treatments in patients with FA has not been well-studied.
Melanoma
Melanoma is highly metastatic and must be removed immediately. The majority of
melanoma are black or brown, or multicolored with asymmetrical and irregular edges.

## Page 145

143
Patients who have received HCT may have an increased number of melanocytic nevi
(moles) on limbs, fingers, ears, or other locations [7] and these patients must be followed
carefully. It is currently unclear whether FA patients have increased risk for melanoma.
However, UV induced immune compromise and DNA damage are both risk factors for
melanoma and have relevance in FA; therefore, it is recommended that clinical care
providers conduct annual full body skin examinations for melanoma (and non-melanoma
cancers) starting at age 18. Similar to BCC and SCC, surgical removal of melanoma is the
best curative option for patients with FA.
Skin Cancer Prevention
It is critical that FA patients practice vigilant skin protection or sun avoidance from an
early age [8]. Skin protection should include protective hats and clothing in addition to
sunscreen. Sunscreens that contain physical blockers, such as zinc oxide and titanium
oxide, are effective and tend to be the gentlest on sensitive skin. Chemical absorbers, such
as benzophenones and salicylates, also provide broad-spectrum coverage though rates of
skin allergies and irritation are higher. Sunscreens of at least 30 SPF should be reapplied
every 1-2 hours. UV interaction with the skin is integral to vitamin D synthesis; therefore,
sunscreen use can decrease vitamin D levels. Diet and vitamin D supplements can provide
adequate amounts of vitamin D (see Chapter 9).

Fanconi Anemia Treatments that Affect the Skin
Androgen Therapy and Laser Hair Removal
Androgen therapy (see Chapter 3) can increase hair growth in both men and women. Laser
treatment may remove unwanted hair, but it is unlikely to have a lasting effect if androgen
therapy continues. The risks of laser hair removal are discomfort, temporary pigment
changes, and scarring. Laser hair removal has not been associated with an increase in the
risk of skin malignancy. Laser treatment should be performed by a licensed physician with
experience in laser therapy.
Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
Cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in patients with FA results primarily from the
reaction of donor T-cells to the patient’s skin after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).
The clinical manifestations and histological features of GvHD closely resemble other
conditions seen post-transplant in patients with FA. In addition, chronic GvHD can present
as pigmentary alteration in the skin, which also is a feature of FA. Therefore, clinical care
providers must prioritize the recognition and management of cutaneous GvHD [9, 10]. The
prevention and treatment of GvHD is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

## Page 146

144
While all stem cell transplant recipients are generally at risk for nonmelanoma and
melanoma skin cancer, patients with FA may be at heightened risk due to their decreased
ability to repair damaged DNA [6]. Skin cancer also may behave more aggressively in this
population [11]. Risk factors in the general population for nonmelanoma skin cancer
include a history of chronic GvHD and/or exposure to prolonged immunosuppression, the
anti-fungal medication voriconazole (see below), and radiation therapy. Risk factors for
melanoma include previous treatment with certain alkylating and antimitotic
chemotherapies and radiation.
Stem cell transplant recipients may develop localized or generalized loss of skin or hair
color, termed vitiligo [12]. The cause of this condition is unclear, though it may be more
common in patients with a history of acute or chronic GvHD. These patients should be
particularly careful to protect their skin from the sun or to avoid sun exposure altogether.
Voriconazole is an anti-fungal agent that increases skin sensitivity to sunlight.
Voriconazole use has been implicated in SCC development in non-FA patients when used
for 12 months [13]; therefore, the use of voriconazole, and other anti-fungal medications,
should be discussed with the FA patient’s hematologist and transplant team.

Summary
Patients with FA experience high rates of abnormal skin changes,
including hyper- or hypo-pigmentation, café au lait spots, the growth
of warts, actinic keratosis, and melanoma and non-melanoma skin
cancers. Patients with FA may be at increased risk for melanoma and
basal and squamous cell carcinomas due to faulty DNA repair
associated with the disease; therefore, it is recommended that they
undergo annual whole body skin examinations from an early age and
no later than 18 years. Patients with FA in all age groups (including
infants and those undergoing HCT) also should follow strict
guidelines to minimize exposure to UV rays by avoiding direct
sunlight through UV blocking clothing or regular application of
chemical sunscreens with UV blocking formulations, such as zinc
oxide. Hematopoietic cell transplant increases the risk for skin-
associated complications such as graft-versus-host disease, which
can affect the skin. The patient’s clinical care team should
continuously monitor the patient for potential cutaneous effects
caused by treatments commonly used for patients with FA.

Clinical Care of Fanconi
Anemia Gastrointestinal
Issues

Introduction
Fanconi anemia (FA) and medications used to treat the disease can
cause gastrointestinal disorders, liver disease, and nutrition-related
challenges. Without proper treatment, these complications can
interfere with daily living and create hurdles for healthy growth
and development.
Concerns related to the gastrointestinal tract that affect patients
with FA most commonly include:
• Anatomic abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract
• Gastrointestinal symptoms, including poor food intake, nausea,
abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea
• Poor weight gain or malnutrition, often resulting from reduced
food intake or difficulty absorbing nutrients from food
• Overweight or obesity
• Cancers of the gastrointestinal tract
• Liver disease
• Gastrointestinal-related complications of hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT)

## Page 150

148
The gastrointestinal clinical care team should include a
gastroenterologist or pediatric gastroenterologist and, when
needed, a dietician. This team should work in close collaboration
with other FA specialists to provide comprehensive care.

Gastrointestinal Tract Anatomic Abnormalities
Approximately 7% of patients with FA are born with anatomic abnormalities in the gastro-
intestinal tract [1]. The most common abnormalities include esophageal atresia (EA), EA
with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), duodenal atresia, and other anorectal
malformations. These malformations may include a blockage of the anus, a failure of the
rectum to connect to the anus, or an abnormal passage between the rectum and another
part of the body, such as the urinary tract or reproductive system. Most anomalies are
diagnosed and treated in early infancy, often before the diagnosis of FA. Gastrointestinal
tract abnormalities may occur in isolation or appear with other birth defects, including the
VACTERL-H spectrum of disorders (described in Chapter 2).
Esophageal Atresia and Tracheoesophageal Fistula
Esophageal atresia, with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF), typically is
diagnosed during pregnancy. Symptoms of EA/TEF in newborns may include excessive
drooling, feeding intolerance, or respiratory difficulties. Infants with EA/TEF who weigh
more than 3 pounds 5 ounces (1500 g) at birth and lack major heart defects have a 98%
survival rate to childhood and beyond [2]. Recent guidelines for management of this
condition have been published elsewhere and can be referred to for additional detail [3].
The severity of the EA/TEF defect and the quality of the repair determine the long-term
complications the patient may experience. One form of EA/TEF known as long gap
atresia—characterized by a gap in the esophagus that spans a distance greater than three
vertebrae of the spine—is difficult to repair and increases the risk that the esophagus will
narrow, resulting in additional complications. A second more severe form of EA/TEF is
called ultra-long gap atresia, defined as a gap in the esophagus that spans five or more
vertebrae. In this form of atresia, the esophageal segments are very short and it is likely
that significant complications will occur. The best practices for treating ultra-long gap
EA/TEF are still under debate [2]; however, patients may require advanced surgical
techniques, including reconstruction of the esophagus using tissue from the colon or
stomach, or operations that induce esophageal growth. These procedures are associated
with many complications, including leakage from the repaired esophagus connections and
swallowing problems such as pain with solid foods, frequent reflux, and vomiting. There
also may be a long-term risk of cancer in colon tissue used to reconstruct the esophagus.

## Page 151

149
Repair of EA/TEF in infancy frequently leads to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
difficulty swallowing, and breathing problems in adulthood [4]. Diagnosis and
management of GERD is essential to reduce pain, bleeding, and narrowing of the
esophagus. Anti-reflux surgery often is necessary to correct the complication. Respiratory
problems, including cough, pneumonia, and wheezing, may suggest the need for
bronchoscopy. Recurrent TEF should be considered if pneumonia or pain develops after a
period of relatively good health.
Duodenal Atresia
Duodenal atresia occurs less frequently than EA/TEF. More than 50% of patients with
duodenal atresia have other birth defects. Approximately 90% of infants survive the
surgical repair of the intestines and will grow normally and develop few symptoms.
However, 12-15% of patients develop complications in the months and years after the
surgery, including abdominal pain, delayed gastric emptying, peptic ulcer,
megaduodenum, reflux of fluids from the intestines into the stomach and esophagus, and
blind loop syndrome. Patients with duodenal atresia frequently experience slow
movement of food through the digestive tract above the intestinal passage formed by
surgery. Enlargement of the duodenum can occur up to 18 years after surgery and is
associated with poor weight gain, vomiting, abdominal pain, and blind loop syndrome, and
usually requires additional surgery [5].
Anorectal Malformations
Anorectal malformations are a spectrum of birth defects in which the gastrointestinal tract
is closed off and not connected to the anus or, instead, opens at an improper location, such
as the skin, urinary tract, or reproductive system. The long-term outlook for patients with
anorectal malformations varies and depends on the type of malformation, surgical
technique used to repair the malformation, presence of additional disorders, ongoing
medical care, and follow up. Management of these complications requires a
multidisciplinary approach. Long-term problems may include fecal incontinence and
constipation with or without encopresis [6]. In most cases, bowel control can be restored
with medication, although some patients may require an antegrade continence enema.

Gastrointestinal Symptoms
Many patients with FA experience gastrointestinal symptoms, including poor food intake,
nausea, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea. These symptoms cause significant discomfort
and may contribute to poor weight gain in FA patients. During routine clinic visits,
clinicians should encourage patients and their families to report gastrointestinal
symptoms, as patients often do not spontaneously disclose these concerns.

## Page 152

150
• Poor Food Intake: Can result from many factors, including complications of anatomic
gastrointestinal abnormalities (narrowing of the digestive tract or complications of
repair), chronic inflammation and/or infection, medication side effects, or neuro-
logic/behavioral problems.
• Nausea: Can result from many factors, but often results from infections, delayed
gastric emptying caused by infection, or medications. Nausea is usually temporary,
resolving once the infection has been cured or the medication stopped. Psychological
stress, anxiety, and depression also can lead to nausea and abdominal pain, and may
worsen existing gastrointestinal complaints.
• Abdominal Pain: May result from partial blockage of the digestive tract, which can be
caused by complications of structural defects in the gastrointestinal system.
Abdominal pain also can result from abnormal gastrointestinal motility, overgrowth of
bacteria in the small intestine, or gallbladder disease.
• Diarrhea: Can occur for a variety of reasons, including opportunistic infection of the
gastrointestinal tract, overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine, medications, and
short bowel syndrome. Constipation with accidental leakage of stool may be mistaken
for diarrhea.
Initial Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms
In all cases, the initial evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in FA patients begins with a
medical history and physical exam. Most problems can be diagnosed at this level without
need for further study. If the patient has non-specific poor food intake, with or without
nausea and abdominal pain, evaluation for evidence of an unobvious infection may be
useful. Infection or systemic inflammation may be identified through laboratory studies,
including urine culture, measurement of serum C-reactive protein, and red blood cell
sedimentation rate. Patients with diarrhea should have stool examination for ova and
parasites, giardia and cryptosporidia antigen, and other opportunistic agents. To diagnose
suspected overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine, hydrogen breath test or an
experimental trial of the antibiotic, metronidazole, are recommended. Duodenal intuba-
tion to collect small intestinal juice for culture is impractical and not recommended for FA
patients, who have both increased radiation sensitivity and increased risk for bleeding.
Evaluation of Gastroesophageal Reflux
A recent endoscopic study of eight patients with FA found evidence of reflux esophagitis in
all at baseline, with five of the eight patients having moderate or severe disease [7]. All
patients with moderate or severe disease were experiencing symptoms of reflux, including
difficult swallowing. Age at initial endoscopy ranged from 10-39 years. Two individuals
with the most severe esophagitis, including the child in the study, developed esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma within two years. Best practice guidelines for evaluation and
management of GERD in patients in the general population have been published for both

## Page 153

151
adults and children [8, 9]. For patients with FA, the symptoms of reflux must be queried at
each visit. Common symptoms of reflux include heartburn, chest pain, abdominal pain at
the midepigastric area, increased burping or hiccupping, and dysphagia. From a strictly
symptomatic standpoint, children with GERD can be treated without further testing if they
are old enough to reliably explain their symptoms. Alternatively, reflux can be diagnosed
in children with a manometric-placed pH/impedance probe. Treatment begins with proton
pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole or lansoprazole at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day until adult
doses are reached). H2-antagonists should be avoided because these drugs increase the
risk of bone marrow suppression. However, a 2019 study suggests that yearly endoscopy,
even in young children, must be considered in FA patients to allow early diagnosis of
esophageal cancer [7] (see Chapter 5).
Evaluation of Delayed Gastric Emptying
Delayed gastric emptying should be suspected in patients who experience nausea, feel full
sooner than usual, and vomit food eaten several hours earlier. Some patients, however,
may experience no symptoms. The test most commonly used to diagnose delayed gastric
emptying in the general population is the nuclear medicine gastric emptying study, which
involves radiation. To avoid radiation exposure in FA patients, a gastric emptying study can
be omitted and a trial of treatment can be initiated, provided that the patient has classic
symptoms, normal physical exam, and no evidence of obstruction in the digestive tract.
Ultrasound-based diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying may be used when available.
Patients who report symptoms such as nausea or abdominal pain within 30 minutes of
starting a meal might have impaired gastric accommodation, a condition in which the
stomach fails to relax and accept food. These patients may benefit from treatment with
the medication cyproheptadine, given 30 minutes before meals. In cases of severe,
uncontrollable nausea without a detectable cause, a trial of the medication ondansetron
may be warranted if there is no improvement with cyproheptadine or domperidone.
The first line of therapy for delayed gastric emptying is dietary. The patient should
undergo dietary counseling with a dietitian to adjust meal content and frequency; small
and frequent meals that restrict fats and nondigestible fibers while maintaining adequate
caloric intake should be favored.
Gastrointestinal motility may be further enhanced by a trial of medication, such as
erythromycin (5 mg/kg/dose, 3 times per day), or—in Canada and Europe—domperidone
(0.25 – 0.5 mg/kg/dose, 3-4 times per day; maximum daily dose of 2.4 mg/kg or 80 mg/day).
Prior to prescribing, the physician must determine if the patient is on any medication that
may interact adversely with the gastric emptying medication. For example, the azole
group of medications (i.e., fluconazole, itraconazole, or ketoconazole) used to treat fungal
infections is known to interact adversely with erythromycin. The use of metoclopramide is
not recommended because of potentially dangerous side effects including irreversible

## Page 154

152
tardive dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by repetitive and involuntary movements. The
combined use of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (20 mg/kg amoxicillin and 1 mg/kg
clavulanate, 2 times per day, with a maximum of 250 mg of amoxicillin, 3 times per day)
has been shown to improve small intestine motility and may be prescribed when the
above medications have failed or if a patient is not tolerating jejunal feeds [10, 11].
Cases of delayed gastric emptying that do not improve with medication may require
surgical procedures, such as endoscopic therapy with pyloric dilatation and botulinum
toxin injection, jejunostomy, or gastro-jejunostomy. Before performing surgery, which
could introduce further gastrointestinal complications, physicians should note that most
cases of delayed gastric emptying in children that occur without an identifiable cause will
resolve over time.

Evaluating Poor Growth
Many children with FA experience poor growth. Weight and height should be measured at
each clinical visit using methods appropriate for the age of the child and plotted on a
graph called a growth curve. Measurements of weight relative to height should be plotted
for children less than two years of age, and measurements of body mass index (BMI)
relative to age should be plotted for children more than two years of age.
Children with FA may be shorter than expected based on the genetic condition itself, the
(non-FA related) genetics contributing to growth pattern in their families, multiple
hormonal abnormalities [12], or growth suppression due to inflammation associated with
infection. Nevertheless, children with FA should have a normal weight-for-height or BMI
for age. Evaluation by a pediatric endocrinologist may be needed for children with FA who
exhibit poor height/linear growth.
Malnutrition, whether the result of poor food intake, high energy utilization, or excessive
stool loss, initially results in a growth curve demonstrating low weight relative to height or
low BMI relative to age. Attention also must be paid to children exhibiting weight loss or
reduced growth rate. One study found that 22% of patients with FA were underweight,
indicative of malnutrition [12]. The overall nutritional status of patients with FA can be
determined during each routine physical exam by assessing muscle mass, skin and mucus
membrane health, and energy and activity levels.
Poor Weight Gain
Parents of children with FA often are concerned about their child’s poor weight gain and
“picky eating.” These two issues should be addressed separately. Approximately 60% of
children with FA have short stature as part of the genetic disease. These children also will
have proportionately lower weights. Medical providers should discuss with parents of FA

## Page 155

153
patients the pattern of their child’s growth curves, particularly the changes in weight
relative to height from birth to two years of age, and BMI after age two. Parents should be
encouraged to accept as normal a child whose weight is appropriate for their somewhat
short height. Aggressively trying to increase the child’s food intake will not increase their
height or overall health, and may create disordered eating or family problems with meals.
Children who are “picky eaters” and their families may benefit from behavioral therapies
to increase the variety of foods eaten. These therapies have not been studied in patients
with FA, but have been effective in other patient populations with poor food intake. For
example, in patients with cystic fibrosis, behavioral modification has demonstrated long-
term improvements in food intake [12].
Poor Food Intake Versus Malabsorption
In patients with documented poor weight gain or weight loss, both poor food intake and/or
diarrhea with malabsorption of nutrients must be considered. Analysis of the patient’s 3-
day dietary record may indicate inadequate protein and calorie intake. Dietary counseling,
with or without evaluation by a feeding specialist, may be enough to improve oral intake
in some patients; however, if food intake does not increase, counseling should be aimed at
maximizing calories by addition of high calorie foods and liquid or powder supplements.
Patients with FA also may have deficiencies in or increased need for specific vitamins and
minerals, including folate and zinc. Even children with adequate weight-for-height may
benefit from a daily vitamin-mineral supplement (generally, an iron-free supplement
should be selected, and excessive doses of vitamins should be avoided, as discussed on
page 168-169).
Vitamin D Deficiency
All patients with FA should be screened for vitamin D deficiency at least once a year,
preferably during the winter, by checking blood levels of the active form of vitamin D,
known as 25-hydroxyvitamin D. If the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is less than 30, then
supplementation with oral vitamin D once a week is indicated. Patients under 44 pounds
(20 kg) should receive 8,000 IU once a week; those over 44 pounds (20 kg) should receive
50,000 IU once a week. Vitamin D levels should be rechecked after 8 weeks, and
supplementation should continue until the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is above 30.
Supplemental Feeding in Children with Fanconi Anemia
Supplemental feeding may be needed to achieve a healthy nutritional status in children
who are persistently less than 85% of the expected weight for their height, who have a BMI
that is persistently less than the third percentile for their age, or who have failed to gain
weight over a 3- to 6-month period. Supplemental feeding via feeding tube, known as
enteral supplementation, is preferable to supplementation by intravenous infusion, known
as parenteral nutrition. Supplemental parenteral nutrition requires placement of a central

## Page 156

154
catheter, which increases the risk of infection, metabolic disorders, and liver injury.
Parenteral feedings should be limited to those patients unable to meet their needs with
enteral supplementation.
Enteral supplementation may be delivered by nasogastric, nasojejunal or gastrostomy
tubes. It is recommended that patients with FA have a nasogastric or nasojejunal feeding
trial before proceeding to gastrostomy. The nasal route is best for patients who require
supplemental feedings for less than three months. Drawbacks of nasal tubes include
increased risk of sinus infection and exposure to ionizing radiation during fluoroscopy
used for tube placement.
Gastrostomy tubes provide more permanent access to the gastrointestinal tract for
administration of enteral feedings. Complications of gastrostomy tubes are limited to local
irritation and/or infection, potentially due to low neutrophil counts. In addition, if the
patient’s platelet level is very low at the time of surgery, excessive bleeding is a risk. Some
patients experience heartburn after starting enteral feeding supplementation, particularly
with nighttime feeds. Vomiting and diarrhea also may occur. Usually, a dietitian or
physician can make simple modifications to the therapy that will alleviate these
symptoms. It is also advisable that patients monitor blood sugar levels regularly when on a
high-calorie diet.
Appetite Stimulants
Before prescribing appetite stimulants, physicians must first investigate and appropriately
manage diagnosable causes of poor appetite and inadequate growth in FA patients.
Appetite stimulants will not treat delayed gastric emptying, depression, chronic infection,
or other treatable causes of inadequate weight gain and growth. It remains unclear
whether any weight gained while taking appetite stimulants will be maintained after the
medication has been stopped.
Nonetheless, several medications have appetite-stimulating side effects (e.g.,
cyproheptadine, megestrol acetate, and the atypical antipsychotic agents, olanzapine and
mirtazapine). Although these drugs were not originally formulated or prescribed as
appetite stimulants—and none has been tested in patients with FA—they have been used
to try to prevent unwanted weight loss in patients with cancer, HIV/AIDS, and cystic fibrosis
[13, 14].
Megestrol acetate has been shown to increase appetite and weight gain in small trials for
relatively short periods [15]. It has a high potential for serious side effects, including
adrenal insufficiency [16, 17]. While possibly suitable for situations where short-term
treatment is needed (for example, during chemotherapy, palliation therapy), it is not
recommended for individuals with FA, who may need long-term appetite stimulation.
Cyproheptadine, an antihistamine used to treat allergic reactions, is a popular appetite
stimulant because it has few side effects besides temporary sleepiness. In randomized,

## Page 157

155
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, the drug was well tolerated by patients with
cancer or cystic fibrosis, but resulted in little or no weight gain [14, 18]. However, some
physicians elect to try this medication before resorting to nasogastric or gastrostomy
feedings. Patients may benefit from cyproheptadine, as it reduces retching [19].
Cannabinoids have been shown to reduce nausea and vomiting in many circumstances
[20]. Although some patients try various forms of cannabinoids to stimulate appetite, use
should be limited to investigational trials until more is learned.

Overweight and Obesity in Fanconi Anemia
As in the general population, some patients with FA are overweight or obese. In one study,
27% of patients with FA were overweight or obese; furthermore, these overweight or obese
patients also tended to have diabetes [21]. Children who have a BMI greater than the 85th
percentile and less than the 95th percentile for age are considered overweight, and those
who have a BMI greater than the 95th percentile for age are considered obese. Both
diagnoses must be confirmed by physical exam. Significant complications may result from
overweight and obesity, including elevated levels of fat and cholesterol in the blood,
diabetes, obstructive sleep disorder, and other aspects of metabolic syndrome.
While a full discussion of the management of overweight and obesity is beyond the scope
of this chapter (see references [22] and [23] for more information), modification of lifestyle
is an essential starting point. Physicians should ask patients to keep a 6-day diary of diet
and daily activity, both of which provide the foundation for counseling regarding dietary
and exercise changes. Most families will require monthly counseling sessions for a time to
ensure achievement of appropriate weight. Psychological counseling also may help,
especially if an eating disorder is suspected. Patients should be urged to avoid fad diets
and over-the-counter weight loss preparations and to focus on healthy lifestyle
modifications.
The obese patient should be assessed for the primary health consequences of obesity. At a
minimum, measurements should include blood pressure using an appropriately sized cuff,
fasting lipid profile, oral glucose tolerance with insulin levels, and blood levels of the liver
enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Obese
patients with sleep disturbance or snoring will require a sleep study and may need an
echocardiogram to assess heart function.

Liver Disease
Liver disease is generally a complication of treatment of FA and patients should be
referred to a gastroenterologist with expertise in treating liver disease. The following
sections provide an overview of the most common liver-related problems that affect
patients with FA.
Liver Complications Associated with Androgens
The androgenic steroids used to treat low blood cell counts in patients with FA can cause
multiple liver complications, including a rare condition called peliosis hepatis, subcellular
changes in liver cells called hepatocytes, and benign liver tumors known as hepatocellular
adenomas [24]. One study of patients with FA found a 5-fold increase in liver enzyme
levels—an indicator of liver injury—in patients with a history of androgen therapy
compared with those without a history of androgen therapy; furthermore, three of the 20
patients treated with androgens developed liver tumors [25]. Thus, careful monitoring for
hepatic complications of androgen therapy is essential. Figure 1 provides a schematic for
liver complication management strategies for FA patients on androgen therapy.

Peliosis Hepatis
Peliosis hepatis (PH) occurs when blood vessels in the liver called sinusoids become
excessively dilated and form large blood-filled spaces, like cysts, that are scattered
throughout the liver. This condition can occur with any dose of androgen therapy and at
any time during treatment. Although many cases of PH are asymptomatic, symptoms may
include abnormal enlargement of the liver, and pain and tenderness in the upper right
portion of the abdomen. This condition can be life-threatening if the sinusoids rupture.
Patients with PH display normal levels of liver enzymes, bilirubin, and tests of liver
function. This condition is best diagnosed via liver biopsy, although imaging techniques
(e.g., ultrasound, angiography, and computed tomography) may reveal large lesions. Liver
biopsy may be impossible in patients who have a high risk of bleeding. The lesions may
regress after androgen therapy ends [18, 19].
Nonspecific Damage to the Cells of the Liver
Androgen therapy can lead to cholestatic jaundice, hypertransaminasemia, or liver
cirrhosis in patients on continued androgen therapy [18]. Cessation of androgen therapy
usually will lead to complete resolution of symptoms. However, if liver enzyme levels do
not return to normal after androgen withdrawal, then liver biopsy may be indicated (see
Chapter 3 for more information on androgens).
Hepatocellular Adenomas
Androgen therapy also can result in hepatocellular adenoma. An adenoma is a benign
tumor that does not invade surrounding tissue; however, it can rupture, leading to life-
threatening bleeding. There also is a risk of malignant transformation, particularly in some
subsets of adenomas [26]. The risk of bleeding in hepatocellular adenomas is increased in
patients with thrombocytopenia. Patients with FA may develop hepatocellular adenomas
rapidly, often within 3 months of beginning androgen therapy [27-29]. Hepatocellular
adenomas are generally diagnosed by ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced CT scans and MRI
are more sensitive than ultrasound in detecting hepatocellular adenomas. Despite the
radiation exposure from CT, it is strongly recommend that all patients receive both CT and
MRI scans before hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) if they have previously
undergone androgen therapy [30]. Hepatocellular adenomas may regress after cessation
of androgen therapy, but if they persist, surgical removal or radiofrequency ablation may
be necessary, particularly prior to HCT.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or malignant liver cancer, is reported occasionally in
association with androgen use. Some studies have suggested that patients with FA may
have an increased risk for HCC resulting from androgen use. The HCC associated with
androgen therapy is characterized by the absence of α-fetoprotein in the blood,

## Page 160

158
distinguishing it from other forms of HCC [18]. Patients who develop HCC should
discontinue androgen therapy.
Prevention and Management of Liver Disease
General protective measures for patients with FA at risk of liver disease include screening,
immunization, and avoidance of substances that may be toxic to the liver. Screening for
liver disease includes measuring blood levels of the hepatocellular enzymes, ALT and AST,
and the biliary enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT),
and/or 5′-nucleotidase. To screen for bile cell injury in children, measurements of GGT and
5′-nucleotidase are preferred over alkaline phosphatase, as alkaline phosphatase can be
elevated by bone injury or bone growth.
Elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin reflect obstruction of bile flow in the liver or
significant liver cell injury. Liver cell function can be investigated by testing how quickly
the blood clots and ultrasound examination may reveal the accumulation of fat or scar
tissue, impaired blood flow, and obstruction of bile flow in the liver.
Patients with elevated liver enzymes should have a full evaluation of their liver by a
hepatologist or pediatric hepatologist. In some cases, liver biopsy may be required to
assess severity of liver disease.
Patients should be immunized against varicella zoster virus (unless live virus vaccines are
contraindicated), hepatitis A virus, and hepatitis B virus. The levels of antibodies against
these viruses should be measured to insure that the patient has acquired immunity. Drugs
that are toxic to the liver, including alcohol, should be avoided when possible. Levels of
fat-soluble vitamins should be monitored on a yearly basis in patients with most forms of
liver disease, particularly in cases of cholestatic disease.

Gastrointestinal and Liver Complications of
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
To treat the blood abnormalities associated with Fanconi anemia (FA), many patients
undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a procedure in which abnormal stem
cells are replaced with healthy stem cells. Prior to HCT, patients must undergo a complete
gastrointestinal, liver, and nutritional evaluation. If undiagnosed chronic abdominal pain
exists, endoscopy for detection of potential sources of bleeding or infection may be
required. Patients who require supplemental feeding via a gastrostomy tube would ideally
have it inserted at least three months prior to HCT to ensure complete healing of the
insertion site. Infections or irritation at the insertion site should be treated prior to HCT. In
addition, diarrhea should be evaluated to detect opportunistic organisms, optimal

## Page 161

159
nutritional status should be achieved, and the liver cell injury and/or function should be
evaluated prior to the transplant. Patients who previously received androgens must be
evaluated for adenomas with ultrasound, CT scan, and an MRI.
A review of the full spectrum of liver- and gastrointestinal-related complications of HCT is
beyond the scope of this work (for a recent review, see [31]).
Historically, patients with FA who undergo HCT had an increased risk of graft-versus-host
disease (GvHD) (see Chapter 3), in which the transplanted cells regard the recipient’s body
as foreign and attack the body, damaging the intestines, skin, and liver [32]. Patients with
FA who develop chronic GvHD after undergoing HCT may experience diarrhea with poor
absorption of nutrients from the diet, resulting in difficulty maintaining weight.
Occasionally, the intestinal tract narrows, causing pain. Pancreatic insufficiency is
uncommon, but should be considered in patients with poor absorption of fat.
Patients with chronic liver GvHD typically experience cholestasis in the liver, with elevated
levels of the liver enzymes ALT and AST. Both enzymes may increase rapidly if the patient
has GvHD and as the doses of immune system-suppressing medications are reduced. It is
uncommon for patients to acquire chronic viral hepatitis from HCT, but this should be
considered if liver enzymes are increasing. If the diagnosis of chronic liver GvHD is
uncertain, liver biopsy is indicated. Chronic GvHD of the liver is treated with immune
system-suppressing medications and ursodeoxycholic acid (20 mg/kg/day). Cholestasis
may lead to poor absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K; therefore, levels of
these vitamins should be monitored to determine whether vitamin supplementation is
needed. Levels of vitamins A, D, and E can be measured via blood tests, and vitamin K
levels can be inferred by measuring the clotting tendency of blood [33].

Gastrointestinal System Cancer Screening
Cancers of the gastrointestinal system are potential complications of Fanconi anemia (FA).
Only one case of colon cancer in a person with FA has been documented in the literature
to date; however, reports from FA adults who attended the Fanconi Anemia Research
Fund’s annual meeting in 2019 revealed that several adults in the FA community have
been diagnosed with colon cancer. The Fanconi Anemia Research Fund is currently
evaluating whether colon cancer screening is warranted. Patients with FA are at increased
risk for esophageal cancer (see Chapters 4 and 5) and screening guidelines are discussed
in Chapter 5. As mentioned on page 157, ultrasound imaging is recommended to screen for
hepatocellular carcinoma for patients taking androgens.

## Page 162

160
Supplementation Risks and Benefits
Currently, no evidence-based studies have shown that large doses of vitamins,
antioxidants, or other micronutrients are effective at treating FA. However, it has been
shown that products containing supplemental iron, vitamins A (including beta carotene), C,
and E, and omega-3 fatty acids may lead to health risks in patients with FA [34]. Large
doses of omega-3 fatty acids, commonly found in fish oil supplements, can increase the
risk of bleeding due to inactivation of platelets. Because patients with FA have reduced
levels of platelets, products that impair platelet function should be avoided. In addition,
vitamins A, C, D, and niacin may be toxic in excess.
Micronutrient supplementation to prevent cancer in patients in the general population has
shown supplementation may reduce cancer risk in populations with nutrient deficiency,
but populations with healthy nutrient levels see no effect or, in some cases, increased
cancer risk [35]. In addition, large studies in the general population have shown that both
vitamin A and vitamin E supplements are associated with an increased risk of some
cancers; therefore, FA patients should avoid additional supplementation with these
vitamins until further study indicates otherwise.
Counteracting oxidative damage by using antioxidants may be important for patients with
FA [36]; however, research has not conclusively proven that supplementation with oral
antioxidants changes the course of the disease. Currently, an ongoing clinical trial at the
University of Cincinnati is examining whether oral delivery of quercetin, a naturally
occurring flavonoid, reduces reactive oxygen species and DNA damage in cells of patients
with FA. Interim results of the phase II prospective squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
chemoprevention study show that oral quercetin led to improved surrogate markers of
genomic instability/DNA damage in buccal mucosal cells from the patients and no adverse
events have been reported [37]. The preliminary results from the trial are encouraging;
however, it is too early to confirm whether quercetin supplementation decreases risk of
SCC in FA patients.

Summary
Patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) experience gastrointestinal
symptoms such as reduced appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, and
diarrhea. These symptoms, in conjunction with anatomical
abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract, can lead to poor weight
gain or malnutrition, or in some cases patients being overweight or
obese. Common treatments for FA, including hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT) can cause severe gastrointestinal complications
including liver disease, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and
potentially cancer. Gastrointestinal abnormalities are typically
diagnosed and treated via surgery in infancy; however, a
comprehensive physical exam is necessary to adequately evaluate
gastrointestinal symptom root causes. Similarly, assessment of poor
growth should be evaluated in the context of poor intake versus
malabsorption issues. Patients with FA who are treated with
androgens should be monitored for liver disease and development of
hepatocellular carcinoma; prevention of liver disease should include
screening and avoidance of substances that cause liver toxicity.
Comprehensive and integrated clinical care that adequately
addresses gastrointestinal issues for patients with FA is necessary to
promote healthy growth, development, and high quality of life.

Chapter 10
Endocrine Disorders in
Patients with Fanconi Anemia

Introduction
Fanconi anemia (FA) and treatments used for the disease can
adversely affect the endocrine system. Studies have shown that
approximately 8 of every 10 patients with FA have at least one
endocrine abnormality [1-10], although the origin of these
abnormalities is unclear. Patients with FA experience endocrine
disorders in myriad ways, including short stature, challenges with
weight, abnormal glucose and insulin metabolism, hormonal
deficiencies, and low bone mineral density. Endocrine abnormalities
influence growth, development, and other aspects associated with the
disease and its treatment. It is imperative that the clinical care team
include an endocrinologist or pediatric endocrinologist, dietician, and,
for females, a gynecologist or a reproductive endocrinologist. The
endocrine team should work in close collaboration with other FA
specialists to provide comprehensive care.

Evaluation of Growth
Growth should be closely followed in children with Fanconi anemia (FA) and nutritional
and/or medical causes for poor growth should be identified as early as possible. Height

## Page 168

166
should be measured with a stadiometer and tracked using a growth chart. Children with FA
who consistently track low on the growth chart compared with the average in the general
population, or whose height gradually falls to a lower percentage, indicating a decline in
annual growth velocity, should be evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist. Endocrine
evaluation should include a full assessment of growth and thyroid hormones, as well as
pubertal status (Table 1).
Short Stature
Short stature is a common characteristic of patients with FA. More than half (60%) of
patients with FA are shorter than all but 2.5% of their healthy peers. In scientific terms, this
means the average person with FA is two standard deviation (SD) units, or -2 SD, shorter
than the average person in the general population [7]. The average height of adult female
patients with FA is about 150 cm (4 feet, 11 inches), while the average adult male patient
with FA is 161 cm (5 feet, 3.5 inches). In children considered “short” by FA standards (at
least shorter than 2 SD below the average in the general population, or < -2 SD), body
heights ranged from 7.8 SD to 2 SD shorter than the average in their healthy peers
(median, about -3.4 SD) [4, 7, 10]. However, there are individuals with FA who have a height
in the normal range, and about 1 of every 10 patients is taller than the average in the
general population [7]. Height is an inherited trait; however, using parental height to
predict adult height of children with FA may not be helpful because their stature is
influenced by other factors [7].
Endocrine Abnormalities and Short Stature
Patients with FA who have hormone deficiencies tend to be shorter than patients with FA
who have normal hormone levels [7, 10]. Adult patients with FA may be even shorter if they
were not treated for growth hormone (GH) deficiency or hypothyroidism as children. One
study described a patient with FA who had a genetic defect in the growth hormone
receptor-signaling pathway that led to low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and primary
IGF-1 deficiency, suggesting primary IGF-1 deficiency should be ruled out if clinical
features are suggestive [1]. However, it is important to note that endocrine defects are not
the only possible reason for short stature. Even FA patients with healthy hormone levels
tend to be shorter than average for the general population, with only about half being
within the height range considered normal. Some patients with FA are very short despite
having normal hormone levels. As a result, hormonal replacement therapy does not
always result in normal growth.
Fanconi Anemia Variants and Short Stature
Certain genetic mutations are strong predictors of short stature in patients with FA,
independent of hormone levels. For example, a subset of patients with the IVS4 A to T
variant of the FANCC gene have an average height of 4.3 SD less than average for the
general population; these patients are significantly shorter than patients with FA who have

## Page 169

167
other variants [10]. In contrast, patients with variants in the FANCA gene are of similar
height to patients with other FA variants [7].
Birth Size and Short Stature
Average birth weight in infants with FA is at the lower end of the normal range, typically
about 1.8 SD less than average for the general population. Approximately half of all
children with FA are considered small for gestational age (SGA) at birth, with length or
weight about 2 SD less than average [7]. In the general population, about 90% of children
who are considered SGA at birth catch up to the normal range for height. In contrast, only
about 25% of FA children who are considered SGA at birth catch up to the normal range
[7]. In one series, the median height of children considered SGA at birth was -2.6 SD, while
the median height of children considered appropriate for gestational age at birth was -2
SD [7].
Poor Nutrition and Short Stature
Being underweight is linked with short stature in patients with FA [7]. Suboptimal nutrition
may predispose children to stunted growth, or growth failure; therefore, dietary changes
may be indicated for maintaining optimal growth (see Chapter 9).
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Short Stature
It remains unclear whether hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) directly affects
growth. However, medications used to treat patients with FA, such as androgens and
corticosteroids, may affect growth and bone maturation, and impair adult height. Some
medications or radiation used during HCT may affect thyroid or gonadal function, which in
turn may negatively impact growth and adult height. In addition, total body, abdominal, or
thoracic radiation used in preparation for HCT may directly influence growth of the spinal
cord.
Targeted Testing for Short Stature
Determining the patient’s bone age (BA) is part of a standard endocrine evaluation for
short stature and involves a radiograph of the left hand and wrist. Bone age may need to
be reassessed every 1-2 years in children with FA who have short stature. The results of BA
assessments are sometimes used in height prediction algorithms, wherein if BA appears
younger than the patient’s actual age, then the height prediction algorithm may suggest
that normal adult height will be attained over time. This prediction assumes that the child
will continue to experience healthy growth, optimal nutrition, normal hormone secretion,
and normal timing of puberty. However, these assumptions are not necessarily correct in
FA patients. Androgen therapy may accelerate BA, while hypothyroidism, GH deficiency,
hypogonadism, and corticosteroid therapy may delay BA. Therefore, estimates of adult
height based on BA may lead to over-optimistic height predictions in patients with FA.
Adult height predictions should be re-evaluated after a decrease in the growth velocity or
following initiation of androgen therapy and after HCT [11].

## Page 170

168
In addition to tracking the patient’s bone age, GH secretion can be indirectly evaluated by
measuring IGF-1 and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels. Levels of these proteins may
be used to screen patients with short stature or growth failure. A thorough evaluation for
GH deficiency by stimulation testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
pituitary gland may be performed, along with consultation with a pediatric
endocrinologist.

Weight Abnormalities in Patients with
Fanconi Anemia
Approximately half of children with Fanconi anemia (FA) are born small for gestational
age (SGA) [7]. In one series, infants with FA who were considered SGA were not only shorter
but also were thinner than infants considered to fall within normal parameters at birth.
Specifically, the average body mass index (BMI) was -1.3 SD in infants considered SGA,
compared with -0.5 SD in infants considered to fall in the average range [7].
The BMIs of children and adults with FA generally are similar to those of the non-FA
population, with average BMIs of -0.2 SD in children and -0.95 SD in adults. One study
suggested a lower average BMI of -1.3 +/-0.2 SD in children and in a few adults with FA
[10]. Other studies reported that about 25-33% of all patients with FA are thin or
underweight, while a few are overweight [4, 7]. The frequency of overweight in children
with FA is similar to that in the general population, with a range of 11-27% depending on
the group of patients studied [4, 7].
In some cases, being underweight may stem from the nutritional and gastroenterological
problems common in patients with FA. Some children may have less than the expected
appetite; others have trouble absorbing nutrients from food (see Chapter 9). In addition,
illnesses that affect FA patients can raise caloric requirements. Glucose intolerance and
insulin deficiency also may contribute to poor weight gain. Excess weight gain, on the
other hand, may reflect lifestyle factors and a genetic predisposition to obesity.
Evaluation of Body Weight
Body weight of FA patients should be assessed at least annually, and more frequently if
there is concern about failure to thrive or excessive weight gain relative to standard
norms. If there are concerns related to body weight, a registered dietitian should assess
the patient’s nutritional intake. In addition, the primary care provider should thoroughly
evaluate the patient for underlying medical conditions, concurrent medications, specific
hormone-related conditions, and related co-morbidities.

## Page 171

169
Dietary Intervention for Weight Abnormalities
Healthy dietary intake should be encouraged, including sufficient calcium and vitamin D
from foods or supplements. Input from a registered dietician may be needed. The
underlying causes of under- or overweight should be addressed, including treatment of
endocrine or gastrointestinal disorders (see Chapter 9). Related co-morbidities due to
obesity should be prevented and treated, as discussed later in this chapter in the sections
on abnormal glucose metabolism, lipid abnormalities, and metabolic syndrome.

Abnormal Glucose or Insulin Metabolism
Diabetes mellitus occurs more commonly in patients with FA than in the general
population [12]; moreover, patients with FA have a relatively high incidence of high blood
sugars without meeting criteria for diabetes, also known as impaired glucose tolerance.
Studies have shown that diabetes was detected in 5-10% of patients with FA, while an
additional 24-68% of these patients had impaired glucose tolerance [2, 4, 6, 7, 10]. As many
as 34-72% of patients with FA had elevated insulin levels 1-2 hours after eating.
Interestingly, in other studies, insulin levels in patients with FA were low 10-45 minutes
after an oral glucose test, suggesting slow initial insulin secretion, but became elevated
60-120 minutes after the test [2, 6]. Although the elevated levels suggest that insulin
resistance may contribute to diabetes in patients with FA and markers of insulin resistance
have been demonstrated in some cohorts [4, 10], these findings also support the possibility
that insulin-producing β-cells do not function properly in patients with FA, which could
impair first-phase insulin secretion [2, 6]; therefore, the diabetes observed in FA is not
typical for either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.
The cause of impaired first phase insulin secretion in patients with FA is unknown but
could stem from possible damage inflicted by enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) on
the β-cells that secrete insulin or, alternatively, from iron overload in heavily transfused
patients. Insulin resistance also appears to be related to ferritin levels and oxidative stress
from iron overload in FA patients [13].
Several medications used in the treatment of FA, particularly androgens and
corticosteroids, are known to alter glucose metabolism. Androgen treatment can
significantly elevate both blood sugar and insulin levels [10]. Chronic steroid therapy also
predisposes patients to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia [14-16]. The guidelines
regarding glucocorticoid use in FA patients should be the same as in any other subject: Use
the lowest possible dose of medication.

## Page 172

170
Screening for Abnormal Glucose and Insulin Metabolism
All patients should be screened for abnormalities related to glucose and insulin
homeostasis upon diagnosis with FA and, if possible, every year thereafter (Table 1).
Patients can be screened for glucose tolerance by measuring blood sugar and insulin
concentrations after fasting for 8 hours, and by measuring post-prandial blood sugar and
insulin concentrations two hours after a meal. The danger of measuring only serum
glucose values, or relying solely on fasting values, is that some patients may be
overlooked—particularly those with impaired glucose tolerance whose blood sugar and
insulin levels are normal after fasting but elevated two hours after a meal. Glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fructosamine levels may be deceptively normal, presumably due
to impaired glycosylation or elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin in patients with bone
marrow failure [7].Therefore, HbA1c scores may provide more useful information after
HCT compared to before HCT.
In FA patients who have suspected endocrine abnormalities and possess risk factors such
as overweight/obesity or hyperlipidemia, a more detailed evaluation is needed in
consultation with an endocrinologist. This evaluation should include a two-hour oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT, 1.75 g glucose/kg body weight, maximum dose 75 g glucose).
Some clinical centers obtain serum samples to measure blood sugar and insulin levels
every 30 minutes during a two-hour OGTT. Patients with abnormal OGTTs must be
followed at least annually with repeat testing. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in
patients with FA increases with age and disease progression, and the majority of FA
patients may be at risk.

Dyslipidemia and Obesity
In one study of 29 patients with FA, over half (55%) had unhealthy levels of cholesterol and
triglycerides, a condition known as dyslipidemia. Of these patients, 21% had elevated
levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 31% had low levels of high-density lipoprotein
(HDL), and 10% had elevated triglycerides [4]. Another study found 17% of pediatric and
adult patients with FA had high cholesterol [7]. An abnormal lipid profile was observed in
40% of patients with hyperglycemia or insulin resistance. Of the patients with FA and
diabetes, 75% were overweight or obese. Adults with FA and diabetes tended to be
overweight or obese, compared with those without these metabolic abnormalities. About 1
in 5 (21%) adults with FA were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, a condition in which
patients are overweight/obese, have dyslipidemia, and develop resistance to the effects of
insulin. Half of the 24 children tested had at least one metabolic abnormality, including 4
children with insulin resistance, 1 with diabetes, and 7 with dyslipidemia [4]. Patients with
FA are at risk for metabolic syndrome, for which a healthy diet, a regular exercise regimen,
and careful screening for blood pressure and lipid abnormalities are recommended.

Bone Mineral Density
Bone mineral density (BMD) in FA has been reported in a few studies with differing
conclusions. In 34 children and 3 adults with FA (including roughly equal numbers of
patients with prior HCT and no HCT), lumbar spine BMD Z-scores adjusted for height age
were in the normal range [8]. However, 3 of 9 children and adolescents <20 years with FA
(33%) who were followed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had low height-
adjusted BMD Z-scores (two of whom had undergone HCT) [20]. These children were older
(13-18 years) and had normal height-adjusted BMD Z-score at the lumbar spine, but low
values at the femoral neck; one child had vertebral compression fractures. It is
recommended that the BMD of children with FA be adjusted for height and that Z-scores
be calculated. An online calculator may be used to calculate the height-adjusted Z-score
in children with FA [21].
Bone mineral density may decrease after HCT in many patients including those with FA,
but the underlying reasons for this remain unclear [22, 23]. In a study of 49 children,
including 12 with FA, BMD decreased during the first year after HCT, with the most
significant bone loss occurring by six months [24]. The effects of HCT on BMD in children
with FA were similar to those in children without FA. The average areal lumbar BMD Z-
score declined 0.5 SD units during the first six months after HCT, and the number of
patients with a Z-score below −1 increased from 34% at baseline to 52% one year after
HCT [1]. The reduction in lumbar BMD at six months correlated with the cumulative dose
of glucocorticoids [23]. While BMD remained within normal limits, the average height-

## Page 175

173
adjusted lumbar BMD Z-score was lower in patients who had undergone prior HCT (-0.9)
compared with those who had not had prior HCT (-0.3) [8]. Long-term prospective studies
are needed to examine the mechanisms underlying decreased BMD following HCT in FA
children.
In adults, HCT is associated with decreased bone formation and increased resorption, and
similar mechanisms may apply in children [25]. Medications used during HCT, such as
glucocorticoid therapy, also may contribute to low BMD. Long-term prospective studies
should explore whether BMD declines further or recovers over time after HCT.
Hypogonadism and growth hormone deficiency (GHD) may also predispose patients with
FA to low BMD.
Screening for Bone Health
Dual energy absorptiometry (DXA) should be used to evaluate BMD in FA patients before
HCT and every two years after HCT [26]. The first DXA evaluation may be performed at
about age 14 if the patient has not undergone HCT, and follow-up scans should be
dictated by the patient’s risk factors. Patients with FA who have hypogonadism and growth
hormone deficiency should be evaluated for low BMD and treated as necessary. Levels of
serum calcium, magnesium, and 25-OH vitamin D levels should be measured in HCT
recipients and in patients with low BMD [27]. Patients exposed to prolonged or high doses
of corticosteroids, or who have a history of fractures, immobility, hypogonadism, or
hormone deficiencies should be referred to an endocrinologist.
Therapies for Bone Health
Among other dietary recommendations, it is important to maintain adequate dietary
intake of calcium and vitamin D to provide the opportunity for normal bone growth and
mineralization. Supplementation should meet standard recommended dietary
requirements. More aggressive intervention with calcium and vitamin D replacement may
be indicated if the patient’s BMD is low after adjusting for height. Vitamin D levels should
be targeted to achieve sufficient concentrations (>30 ng/mL) [28]. Treatment of hormone
deficiency—specifically treatment of pubertal delay, hypogonadism, and GHD—is
beneficial for bone mineralization.
Bisphosphonates are effective in preventing bone loss after HCT in adults and may be
effective in improving the BMD in HCT-recipient children as well, but more studies are
needed before a routine recommendation can be made regarding their use for the
treatment of low BMD [29]. Experienced endocrinologists or nephrologists may consider
treatment with bisphosphonates in children with FA who, after vitamin D deficiencies have
been addressed, sustain two or more low-impact fractures and have height-adjusted BMD
Z-scores lower than -2 SD. Oral bisphosphonates should be used with caution as they may
worsen esophageal reflux and have other potential health concerns. The risk/benefit ratio
of this treatment must be evaluated by a specialist prior to treatment.

174
Hypothyroidism
Many children with FA (from 30-60%, depending on thyrotropin or thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) cut off values) have mildly abnormal levels of serum thyroid hormones,
including borderline low levels of thyroxine (T4) or Free T4 (FT4), or borderline high levels
of TSH [3, 4, 7, 10]. This combination of test results is consistent with mild hypothyroidism.
Mild hypothyroidism can occur either because the thyroid gland is abnormal and cannot
make enough T4 hormone (known as primary hypothyroidism) or because the thyroid
gland is normal, but the pituitary gland does not make enough TSH to stimulate the
thyroid (known as central hypothyroidism). Central hypothyroidism was noted in 20-25% of
patients with FA who were tested with overnight TSH or TSH surge due to low or low
normal FT4 [4, 7, 17].
The mechanism causing hypothyroidism in FA patients remains unclear, but there is no
indication that the primary hypothyroidism stems from an autoimmune process, in which
the body mounts an immune attack against itself. Therefore, the thyroid appears to fail for
other, yet-to-be-determined reasons in patients with FA. Hypothetically, some thyroid cells
may die because of unrepaired DNA damage stemming from oxidative injury. One study
described reduced thyroid hormone binding in persons with FA [10]. Although reduced
thyroid hormone binding often is not clinically significant, it can make total T4 levels
appear low and falsely suggest hypothyroidism without causing TSH elevation. Thyroid
hormone binding globulin (TBG)-bound T4 (but not other bound forms) was lowest in
patients with FA receiving androgen therapy [10], suggesting the need to use FT4 and TSH.
Thyroid Evaluation
Thyroid function should be evaluated by obtaining an early morning (e.g., 8:00 am) blood
sample and measuring FT4 and TSH levels. All FA patients should undergo screening for
hypothyroidism once a year; or more often if clinically indicated. One example would be if
the patient shows signs of growth failure (Table 1). Central hypothyroidism is suggested by
low levels of FT4 and by a TSH ratio of less than 1.3 at 8:00 am compared to afternoon TSH
[17]. Patients who are diagnosed with central hypothyroidism should undergo evaluation
for other pituitary hormone deficiencies; specifically, the physician should rule out central
adrenal insufficiency and consider ordering a pituitary MRI.
Treatment of Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism should be treated promptly, particularly in children younger than 3 years
of age. Thyroid hormone replacement treatment should be initiated just as in non-FA
patients based on low thyroid hormone levels; specifically, a FT4 level below the
laboratory reference range and/or a TSH level above the reference range. Thyroid

## Page 177

175
hormone therapy should strive to reduce TSH levels to the range of 0.5-2 mU/L in patients
with primary hypothyroidism. In central hypothyroidism, therapy should aim to raise FT4
levels to just above the middle of the normal range.
There is ongoing controversy about the use of TSH levels greater than 3 mU/L as a
threshold for the treatment of mild hypothyroidism [17]. Some endocrinologists may use a
TSH level of 3 mU/L, or even 4.5-5 mU/L, as the upper limit of a normal TSH level in
healthy individuals. However, treatment, especially in adults, is often not considered
necessary unless TSH levels are persistently 10 mU/L or higher, or unless FT4 levels are
low [30-32]. Among pediatric endocrinologists, some use the above approach, while others
prefer to treat mildly elevated TSH levels in the hopes of improving their patients’ growth
[17].
In one study, eight children with FA were treated for seven months with thyroid hormone
and for seven months with placebo; the treatment and placebo phases occurred in random
order. Children grew significantly better on thyroid hormone than on placebo, and parents
reported that their children had better energy levels during the thyroid hormone phase [3].
This study suggests that children with FA who have short stature and borderline results on
thyroid function tests may benefit from using thyroid hormone therapy; however, it should
be noted that only a small number of patients were studied.

Growth Hormone Deficiency
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) has been described in case reports of a few patients
with Fanconi anemia (FA) [33-37]. In one study, more than half (54%) of patients younger
than 20 years failed to produce growth hormone (GH) in response to clonidine, a
medication known to stimulate GH. Similarly, most patients (72%) failed to raise GH levels
in response to another GH stimulator, arginine. Using a more stringent criterion for
diagnosing GHD (specifically, peak GH levels < 5 mcg/L), but without priming the patients
in advance, 12% of 32 children tested had GHD and nearly half of them had a small
pituitary gland on MRI [7]. In studies from other centers, nearly half of the patients
evaluated for GHD had low GH levels [10]. One in five patients with suspected GHD had a
midline defect on the brain MRI [4]. Growth hormone deficiency was more common in
patients who had undergone HCT (25%) than in patients who did not have HCT (8%) [7].
The processes that underlie secretion of GH may be abnormal in children with FA during
spontaneous overnight GH secretion studies [10], although these results are sometimes
difficult to interpret because of the significant overlap with values observed in children
without GHD [7]. Taken together, these test results suggest that while few children with FA
have GHD, others may have an underactive hypothalamus, leading to “partial” GH
deficiency or, alternatively, to neurosecretory GH deficiency. In these individuals, GH and

## Page 178

176
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) values may not be as severely affected as the patient’s
height.
Evaluation for Growth Hormone Deficiency
Screening for GHD in a child with poor growth can be performed by drawing a blood
sample and measuring IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels (Table 2). If IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 values are
below -2 SD for the patient’s age, evaluation should include standard GH stimulation
testing. One caveat is that IGF-1 is known to be a poor marker of GHD in thin individuals or
in those who have received total body or cranial radiation. Sex steroid priming should be
considered prior to GH stimulation testing in pre-pubertal girls age 10 years and older, and
in pre-pubertal boys age 11 years and older or who are in stage two of puberty [38, 39].
Evaluation of GH secretion in a slowly growing child should be done through the use of
two standard GH stimulation tests, including clonidine (150 mcg/m
2, maximum dose 300
mcg), arginine (0.5 g/kg, maximum dose 20 g), or glucagon (0.3 mg/kg, maximum dose 1
mg) [39-41]. Peak GH levels are considered normal if they rise to 10 ng/mL or greater [42].
Patients diagnosed with GHD should be evaluated for central hypothyroidism, central
adrenal insufficiency, and also should undergo an MRI scan of the pituitary gland.
Treatment of Growth Hormone Deficiency
Patients with FA who have GHD can be treated with recombinant human GH therapy. A
short child with FA is a candidate for treatment with GH if GHD has been convincingly
documented by the child’s short stature, slower than normal growth rate, and low GH peak
on a stimulation test. Physicians should counsel FA patients and families about the risks
and benefits of therapy. To date, there is no clear consensus on the safety of GH therapy in
FA patients. Though having FA is not an absolute contraindication to GH treatment, there is
some controversy surrounding the use of GH in patients without GHD. It should be
recognized that in some instances, treatment with GH may be instituted in the absence of
GHD if deemed appropriate by the patient care team, either before or after HCT. In the
absence of safety data, GH therapy in FA patients should be titrated to achieve IGF-1
concentrations in the mid-to-normal range for the patient’s age (i.e., between 0 and 1 SD).
Therapy should be discontinued immediately if routine hematological examination reveals
clonal hematopoietic stem cell proliferation. Growth hormone therapy should be
temporarily discontinued immediately prior to HCT and for at least six months after HCT,
as well as during critical illness [43].
One study found positive effects of GH treatment in 75% of children with FA treated with
HCT, with at least a 0.5 SDS increase in height [44]. In studies of patients without FA, the
response to GH treatment after HCT has varied [45-48]. Ongoing use of glucocorticoids
after HCT may limit the patient’s growth response. In a study that included HCT recipients,
GH treatment was associated with significantly improved adult height (on average,
patients treated with GH grew about 4-5 cm taller than untreated children) [49] and did

## Page 179

177
not increase the risks of recurrent leukemia, secondary malignancies, or diabetes in post-
HCT patients treated with GH compared with those who were not treated. A beneficial
effect of GH treatment on growth rate after HCT also has been reported by others [50, 51].
Patients with FA are inherently at an increased risk of cancer, particularly for acute
leukemia prior to HCT, as well as malignancies of the head and neck, and gynecological
cancers [52-54]. At this time, there is no evidence that this risk is enhanced in FA patients
treated with GH. Patient registries have provided useful safety and efficacy data on the use
of GH in the general population and in cancer survivors, but have included few patients
with FA [55-61]. A large study of 13,539 cancer survivors, including 361 patients treated
with GH, did not find an increased risk of cancer recurrence in GH-treated survivors [62].
However, the risk of a second neoplasm, mostly solid tumors, was slightly increased in
survivors treated with GH.
Despite these possible risks, it should be noted that severe short stature may have a
negative impact on the patient’s quality of life and daily functioning. Patients and families
should be counseled regarding the predicted adult heights, the effects of available
treatment modalities on growth rate, and the potential risks and benefits of GH
treatment—with the caveat that there is no clinical information about the long-term
safety of GH therapy in patients with FA.

Cortisol Sufficiency
Most FA patients have normal circadian cortisol levels and experience normal responses
to treatment with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH stimulation testing has
been normal even in patients with reported pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS)
and multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies [4]. However, cortisol sufficiency should be
evaluated in young children with FA who have poor growth and who require major surgery
because of possible central hypothalamic dysfunction, even in the absence of a detectible
midline central nervous system defect [9, 33]. Finally, ACTH stimulation testing is
recommended to rule out central adrenal insufficiency if the patient has other pituitary
hormone deficiencies.

Multiple Pituitary Hormone Deficiencies
In previous studies, MRI scans of the brain and pituitary gland have suggested that the
pituitary gland is smaller and has a thinner stalk in patients with FA compared with age-
matched children without FA [9, 63]. Studies also have shown midline and other central
nervous system abnormalities on brain MRI [64]. Three patients with FA at the National

## Page 180

178
Institutes of Health (NIH) had pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) with or without
septo-optic dysplasia. This syndrome has previously been reported in eight other patients
with FA [34, 65-67], and was associated with permanent GHD and severe growth failure.
Specifically, the average height SD of all the children with PSIS at diagnosis was -4.6, with a
range of -3.7 to -5.7. These patients also were at risk for multiple pituitary hormone
deficiencies: 5 of 10 patients with FA and PSIS had hypothyroidism, 1 of 10 patients had
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and the remaining 4 patients were too young to
evaluate. Furthermore, 5 of 6 male patients had cryptorchidism, in which one or both
testicles fail to descend, and 4 of 6 male patients had microphallus. Together, these
findings suggest that in addition to GHD, the male patients had hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, a condition in which the testes produce lower than normal amounts of sex
hormones due to an underlying problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.
Based on the available evidence, a brain MRI with emphasis on the pituitary/hypothalamic
area should be obtained in any FA patient who has one or more pituitary hormone
deficiencies, including GHD, central hypothyroidism, or ACTH deficiency. Serum IGF-1
testing has been proposed as a screening test, as all patients with PSIS and GHD had low
IGF-1 levels [67]. Serial endocrine testing is essential in patients with PSIS because pituitary
hormone deficiencies may evolve over time.

Genital Tract Abnormalities
Developmental anomalies of the genital tract are more frequent in patients with FA than
in the general population. Male patients with FA may be born with undescended testicles
and hypospadias, a condition where the urethra opens on the underside of the penis. Many
boys with FA have small testes for their age and pubertal status, most likely reflecting
reduced Sertoli cell mass and spermatogenesis. Female patients with FA may be at higher
risk for certain reproductive malformations, including a smaller than normal uterus, half-
uterus, or uterus that does not open into the vagina [68].

Puberty
Children and adolescents with FA may enter puberty earlier than their healthy peers. If
puberty starts too early or progresses too quickly, it may limit the number of years a child
can grow and, thus, compromise adult height. A child with FA who experiences an early
onset of puberty and has short stature may benefit from gonadotropin-releasing hormone
agonist therapy. One study suggests this therapy can delay puberty to increase the
patient’s adult height by an average of 4-5 cm after four years of therapy [69]. More

## Page 181

179
commonly, children with FA enter puberty later than their healthy peers. Studies have
shown that 12-14% of girls with FA had delays in starting their menstrual cycles [4, 7].
While delayed puberty is fairly common, its underlying cause is not well understood. There
may be blunted and/or prolonged gonadotropin (primarily luteinizing hormone (LH))
responses to stimulation, suggesting abnormal regulation of the hypothalamic and
pituitary glands (see Chapter 7). Chronic illness also is associated with delayed pubertal
maturation. Total body radiation and some chemotherapy agents used during HCT also
may affect gonadal function.
Evaluation for Pubertal Disorders
In patients with FA, the onset, pubertal stage, and tempo of progression of puberty should
be monitored during annual physical examinations. Physical exams should include Tanner
staging of pubic hair, and assessments of breast development in girls and testicular size in
boys (Table 1). Assessment of bone maturation can be useful in adolescent children who
experience delayed or abnormal progression of puberty, while measuring the con-
centrations of certain hormones (particularly LH, FSH, estradiol, or testosterone) can be
useful in adolescents and in adults who develop symptoms of hypogonadism.
Treatment of Delayed Puberty
A boy with FA who shows no signs of puberty by age 14 years should be evaluated for
possible causes of delayed puberty. After evaluation, low-dose testosterone therapy can
be initiated according to the child’s height and growth potential. Young boys with
confirmed hypogonadism can be treated using topical gel preparations or by injections of
testosterone started at an appropriately low dose and gradually increased over several
years to adult replacement levels. It is important to avoid rapid increases in testosterone
levels in adolescents to ensure continued height gain and avoid premature fusion of the
growth plates. Bone age should be monitored during therapy.
Similarly, a girl with FA who shows no signs of puberty by age 13 years should receive a full
hormonal work up. After evaluation, low-dose estrogen therapy may be started and slowly
titrated under the care of the pediatric endocrinologist or adolescent gynecologist, taking
into account the child’s height and potential for growth. It is important to avoid rapid
increase in estradiol levels in adolescents to ensure continuing height gain and to avoid
premature fusion of the growth plates (see Chapter 7). Bone age should be monitored
during therapy. Estrogen therapy will increase bone mineralization, optimize the child’s
growth rate, and achieve breast development. Progesterone (i.e., medroxyprogesterone, 10
mg by mouth daily for 10 days) should be added when breakthrough bleeding occurs or
after two years of estrogen replacement therapy. Estrogen therapy is not needed if a
female patient with FA has normal pubertal development or is having normal menstrual
cycles, even if there is evidence of ovarian hormone deficiency.

## Page 182

180
Hypogonadism
Hypogonadism is very common in adults with FA. In addition, hypogenitalism with small
testes and penis size affects 64% of men with FA, while premature ovarian failure affects
77% of women with FA [4]. In another study, 40% of adults with FA had evidence of
hypogonadism [7]. Both hypergonadotropic (either testicular or ovarian) hypogonadism
[66] and hypogonadotropic (specific to the hypothalamic-pituitary glands) hypogonadism
have been reported in FA patients. Gonadal function may be affected by several factors,
including FA itself, SGA status at birth, gonadotropin deficiency, cryptorchidism, and/or the
conditioning regimen used for HCT, including radiation and chemotherapy [67].

Fertility
Patients with FA often experience fertility problems, with males often being infertile and
females often having premature menopause in their 20s or 30s, although pregnancies have
been documented (see Chapter 7) [68, 70]. Contraception should always be used when
pregnancy is not desired. Infertility may stem from a number of different factors, including
a reduced sperm count in men, treatments for HCT, and the type of genetic mutation
underlying FA. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone has been shown to acutely upregulate
the expression of FANCA mRNA and protein, suggesting that FANCA plays a regulatory role
in gonadal function [71]. Disruption of FANCA in mice is associated with hypogonadism
and a reduction in fertility [72]. Animal studies also have shown that the FANCC protein is
required for the proliferation of primordial germ cells [73]. Primary ovarian insufficiency
also was observed in a mouse model with FANCE mutation [74]. In addition, radiation or
chemotherapy with HCT may contribute to decreased fertility after HCT. Cryopreservation
of embryos or sperm is being investigated as a reproductive option. Future studies are
needed to more fully address the fertility issues in FA patients.

Endocrine Abnormalities Specific to Adults with
Fanconi Anemia
Endocrinopathies clearly persist into adulthood, though the treatment of FA with
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can alter the course of disease. Early endocrine
diagnosis and therapy may improve the patient’s quality of life. Treatment of endocrine
issues in adults with FA should be monitored by endocrinologists who care for adults, with
attention to the patient’s thyroid status, glucose tolerance, lipid abnormalities,
maintenance of normal BMI, gonadal function, and bone mineral density. Thus far, results

## Page 183

181
from endocrine studies have been reported only for a small number of adults with FA [4, 7,
8, 10].
Lipid abnormalities were frequently seen in nearly 40 patients with FA who were followed
at the NIH (unpublished data). More than half of the adults had one or more of the
following lipid abnormalities: total cholesterol >200 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dL,
LDL cholesterol >129 mg/dL, or triglycerides >150 mg/dL. Insulin resistance, as determined
by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), and metabolic syndrome also were
common in adults.
Thyroid abnormalities remain prevalent in FA patients older than 18 years, with 37% to
57% of patients having hypothyroidism. These patients typically present with either
elevated TSH levels or low Free T4 levels [4, 7]. In one study, a low stimulated GH peak was
observed in a small number (6 of 16) of adults with FA [4, 7]. Hypogonadism with small
testes was present in at least half (50%) of men with FA, and hypogonadism was present in
one-third (30%) of women with FA. In addition, many women with FA experience
premature menopause (see Chapter 7).
One study reported decreased BMD (osteopenia or osteoporosis) in 12 of 13 adults with FA
[4]. Of the eight females with decreased BMD, seven experienced premature ovarian
failure and early menopause [4]. In 15 adult female patients with FA from the same center,
five (33%) had osteoporosis and all had hypogonadism, which appears to be the
predominant cause of low BMD in adult female patients with FA [20]. However, the BMD
was not adjusted for height in this study, and the measured BMD may have underestimated
the volumetric BMD in several individuals with short stature whose bones were likely
smaller than those of other participants [75]. It is not clear whether BMD in adults with FA
should be routinely adjusted for height. The correlation of fracture risk with height-
adjusted BMD in adults with FA also is unknown. Additionally, many FA adults have
hypogonadism, other endocrine deficiencies, and have undergone HCT—all of which may
adversely affect bone health and trigger the early development of osteoporosis.

Medications and Treatments That Affect
Endocrine Function
Androgen Therapy
Androgen therapy is used to improve the blood counts of patients with FA and can cause
endocrine-related side effects that need to be monitored (see Chapter 3). Androgens can
improve growth rates, but often hasten the maturation of growth plates, which reduces the
time available for childhood growth. Children treated with androgens may appear to be
growing well, but their potential adult height may decline due to rapid skeletal maturation

## Page 184

182
and premature fusion of cartilage plates at the end of long bones, known as epiphyseal
fusion. Androgen use, in particular with oxymetholone, also may result in virilization in
both males and females. The impact of androgen therapy on height and bone maturation
should be discussed with the patient’s family. Prior to beginning androgen therapy, a bone
age X-ray should be performed. During androgen therapy, the patient’s bone age should
be reassessed periodically, and may be checked every 6-12 months.
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
Transplantation is inherently associated with a state of illness. Illness is not an optimal
time to assess any hormone concentrations, as illness often alters thyroid levels, growth,
gonadal function, nutrition, and glucose regulation. The treatments and radiation used
during HCT may exacerbate the patient’s underlying intrinsic risk for endocrine disorders
and lead to growth failure as a consequence of GHD, primary hypothyroidism, gonadal
failure, and decreased BMD. Therefore, FA patients who undergo HCT should be closely
monitored for hormonal abnormalities [26]. The late effects screening guidelines [26]
recommend that a full endocrine evaluation including height/weight measurements,
Tanner staging, bone age and growth factors should be assessed after HCT in children. In
addition, screening is recommended for diabetes, dyslipidemia, vitamin D deficiency and
osteoporosis (DXA scan before HCT and every two years after HCT). Some of these
guidelines have been outlined by the Children’s Oncology Group [76]. Many agents used in
HCT have side effects on the endocrine system. Busulfan can adversely affect thyroid
function [77] and sometimes growth [78, 79]. It is highly toxic to gonads and can lead to
gonadal failure, particularly in females [80, 81]. Cyclophosphamide has a known dose-
related effect on gonadal function in both males and females, particularly when used in
combination with busulfan [25, 82-84]. Glucocorticoids can lead to increased appetite,
weight gain, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia, sometimes creating the need for insulin
therapy. Prolonged use of glucocorticoids may cause linear growth failure and delayed
puberty. Glucocorticoids adversely affect bone mineralization [5]. Methotrexate increases
the risk for bone loss [85, 86]. Total body irradiation (TBI) increases the risk of primary
hypothyroidism [87, 88], growth impairment [79, 89], hypogonadism [82, 90], and poor bone
mineralization [91, 92].

Summary
Endocrine problems are common in FA patients, who often—though
not always—are shorter than the general population. Patients with
FA may have reduced GH secretion, hypothyroidism, and abnormal
glucose homeostasis with deficient pancreatic beta cell secretion of
insulin and/or insulin resistance. Puberty, gonadal function, and
fertility may be affected in these patients. Older children and adults
with FA tend to have low BMD. Height adjusted BMD Z-scores should
be used in children, but it is unclear if BMD should be adjusted for
height in adults with FA and short stature, and if these measures
correlate with the risk of bone fractures. However, the high incidence
of endocrine dysfunction—especially hypogonadism, corticosteroid
use, and HCT—may predispose adults with FA to osteoporosis.
The origin of endocrine disorders in FA patients remains unclear.
Hypothyroidism generally is accompanied by elevated TSH levels
and, thus, seems to arise from problems with the thyroid gland,
although hypothalamic-pituitary dysregulation leads to abnormal
central TSH release in some patients. Hyperglycemia/
hyperinsulinemia generally is thought to arise from pancreatic beta
cell dysfunction, but insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome also
are common in patients with FA. In contrast, GH insufficiency
probably arises from problems with the hypothalamus or pituitary
gland. Currently, a single unifying cause for all of these
endocrinopathies is not known. It is possible that endocrine secretory
cells are damaged by excessive reactive oxygen species, with
inadequate repair mechanisms in patients with FA. In addition,
treatments used in FA such as androgens, glucocorticoids,
chemotherapy, or radiation with HCT may contribute to endocrine
dysfunction.

Chapter 11
Hearing and Ear Issues in
Patients with Fanconi Anemia

Introduction
Hearing and ear anomalies are prevalent in patients with Fanconi
anemia (FA). Three of every 20 patients with FA have ear
malformations [1] and reported prevalence of hearing loss in
patients with FA ranges from 11% to 50% [2, 3]. Hearing loss in
patients with FA is typically mild; however, it can impair an
individual’s communication abilities and interfere with language
development and learning. This chapter will describe common
concerns related to ear abnormalities and hearing loss in patients
with FA, routine auditory monitoring, amplification tools, and
surgical management. The ear and hearing clinical care team for
patients with FA should include an otologist and an audiologist and,
when needed, a speech-language pathologist. This team should
work in close collaboration with other FA specialists and the primary
physician to coordinate care.

## Page 192

Hearing and Ear Abnormalities in Patients with
Fanconi Anemia
Researchers at the National Institutes of Health published a study in 2016 on 33 patients
with FA who ranged from 3-56 years old to systematically examine and define ear and
hearing abnormalities in this patient population [4]. In this study, comprehensive
audiologic information available for 31 of the patients showed that hearing loss was
detected in 14 (45 %) of the patients: 5 patients had bilateral hearing loss and 9 had
unilateral hearing loss. The remaining 17 patients had normal hearing. The majority of
hearing loss was classified as mild in degree. Out of the 14 patients with hearing loss, the
most common type of hearing loss was conductive, which was found in 9 patients, or 64%.
Sensorineural hearing loss (found in 2 patients or 14%) and mixed hearing loss (found in 1
patient or 7%) were less commonly observed.
After detailed microscopic ear examination, structural ear abnormalities were detected in
18 out of the 31 (58%) patients. Narrow ear canals and abnormally shaped pinna were
identified in 10 (32%) and 3 (10%) patients, respectively. One patient with FA was born with
an absent ear canal, an anomaly known as aural atresia. The most frequent finding was a
small tympanic membrane in 18 patients, followed by the short handle of the malleus
(manubrium) that was abnormally positioned on the eardrum in 16 patients, and the
presence of abnormal bony islands (bony plate) under the eardrum in 12 patients (see
Figure 1 as an example). One patient had an underdeveloped auditory nerve and profound
sensorineural hearing loss unilaterally. Interestingly, an absent or underdeveloped radius
found in 21% of the patients with FA was associated with hearing loss, suggesting a
developmental relationship between the radius and structural ear abnormalities [4]. The
results from this study indicate the incidence of hearing loss and congenital ear
malformation is much higher in patients with FA than previously reported [1-3]. The
findings suggest that abnormal features can be present even if the hearing is normal or
only slightly reduced.
In a separate retrospective study of 17 FA patients who underwent a speech in noise (SIN)
test, speech reception in noises was subnormal in nine subjects (53%) and abnormal in two
subjects (12 %). Two patients with an abnormal SIN test and six patients with a subnormal
SIN test had normal audiograms [5].

with the bony plate (*), manubrium (Ñ), and chorda tympani nerve (¨) highlighted.

Early and Periodic Auditory Monitoring for
Patients with Fanconi Anemia
Any child diagnosed with Fanconi anemia (FA) should undergo comprehensive
assessments of his or her ears and hearing by an otolaryngologist and an audiologist,
respectively. Newborn hearing screening tests can miss slight or mild degrees of hearing
loss; therefore, all children with FA, including those who pass their newborn hearing
screening, should receive follow-up audiologic testing. The earlier hearing loss is identified
and treated, the less severe possible permanent effects may be. Research has shown that
early identification and treatment (e.g., speech therapy, amplification devices, and
educational accommodations and interventions) within the first six months of life can
alleviate the long-term adverse effects of hearing loss on learning and language
development [6].
Before the age of 3 years, such testing can rule out hearing loss that may affect speech and
language development [7]. By the age of 5 or 6 years it is possible to obtain very complete
testing across the speech frequencies to rule out a hearing loss that may have subtle
effects on communication and learning. A speech in noise (SIN) test should be included as
a part of hearing evaluation.
Once hearing loss is identified, the patient’s hearing should be monitored regularly. Babies
and toddlers should be seen by an audiologist every 3-4 months, whereas older children
should be seen every 6 months until age 6 or 7, after which an annual audiological
assessment may be sufficient. If the child’s hearing loss is not stable or if other hearing
related issues arise, more frequent monitoring may be recommended. Adults with hearing

## Page 194

192
loss should receive annual audiologic monitoring, or immediate evaluation if they suspect
a change in hearing.
It remains unclear whether FA is associated with progressive hearing loss. Therefore, FA
patients who have been diagnosed with normal hearing should have their hearing
monitored regularly (approximately every 2-3 years). Hearing tests should be performed
more frequently in children, because they are unable or unlikely to self-report concerns
about difficulties hearing or communicating. Patients with FA are likely to undergo
medical and surgical treatments that can potentially affect hearing. Many patients with FA
will be treated with medications that are potentially ototoxic. Furthermore, patients with
FA are susceptible to recurrent infections due to neutropenia, multiple blood transfusions
for severe anemia, and malignancies of the blood and solid tissues; these conditions
increase the risk of exposure to ototoxic medications, such as intravenous antibiotics (e.g.,
aminoglycosides such as gentamicin), iron-chelating agents (e.g., deferoxamine), and
chemotherapy agents (e.g., cisplatin). It is important to establish the patient’s baseline
hearing level before he or she is treated with ototoxic medications, and to monitor the
patient’s hearing closely during treatment. Lastly, the genetic instability associated with FA
has been associated with premature aging processes [8]; therefore, patients with FA may
be at risk of developing age-related hearing loss at an earlier age than the general
population.

Consequences of Hearing Loss
Children use their hearing to develop speech, language, communication skills, and to
facilitate learning, so consequently, hearing loss can interfere with language development
and learning. Even slight or mild hearing loss makes it difficult to hear a teacher or peers
who are not within close range, especially in environments with a lot of background noise,
such as a typical classroom. Left untreated, hearing loss can cause delays in language
development and gaps in education. Even if the hearing loss only occurs in one ear and the
other ear is normal, a child can have enough trouble hearing in school or in other
situations that it impairs his or her social interactions and academic potential [6, 9-11].
Even minimal hearing loss can negatively impact a child’s social and academic
development. A slight to mild degree of hearing loss can make it difficult to understand
speech that is not presented at close range, or that is obscured by background noise.
Moderate, severe, and profound hearing loss impairs the ability to understand speech
under any conditions, and will significantly affect learning and the development of speech
and language abilities unless the hearing loss is identified and treated by 6 months of age
[12].
Children with hearing impairment often require some form of special education or related
services [13]. The United States’ federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)

## Page 195

193
[14] mandates the development of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for any student
with a disability who needs special education. Early intervention and academic support
teams should work in conjunction with health care providers, such as audiologists and
speech pathologists, to identify intervention and academic needs. Section 504 of the U.S.
Rehabilitation Act contains provisions for a school-aged child with hearing loss who needs
accommodations, such as remote microphone Hearing Assistive Technology (HAT), to
access the educational curriculum, but who does not need one-on-one special education
teaching or therapy services [15]. This act also contains provisions for workplace
accommodations, which should be sought out as needed by employees with hearing loss.
Hearing loss in adults can impair an individual’s communication abilities, especially if the
listening situation is not ideal. It can make a person reluctant to participate in
conversation and avoid social situations, and can cause fatigue if visual and contextual
clues are required to fill gaps between what was said and what was heard.

Amplification
If hearing loss is identified in a child or an adult with Fanconi anemia (FA), an audiologist
should evaluate the patient’s need for hearing aids and/or hearing assist technologies.
There are many different types of devices available. The audiologist will make a
recommendation for the appropriate device based on the patient’s lifestyle, type and
degree of hearing loss, and the environment in which the device will be used. For example,
a school-aged child may need different features on his or her device than an adult in the
workforce.
Hearing Aids
Hearing aids are devices worn in or behind the ear that can be beneficial for all types of
hearing loss (conductive, sensorineural, or mixed) and almost all degrees of hearing loss.
Hearing aids can be used by patients of any age—even babies in their first few months of
life. The audiologist programs the hearing aid specifically for a patient’s degree and
configuration of hearing loss and can reprogram the device later if the patient’s hearing
changes. Hearing aids differ in technology, size, power, and availability of special features.
Hearing Assistive Technology
Remote microphone Hearing Assistive Technology (HAT) helps hearing-impaired
individuals function in daily communication situations. They may be used alone or in
combination with hearing aids. Hearing assistive technology is typically only used for
specific listening situations, such as environments with a lot of background noise (e.g.,
school classrooms, restaurants, movie theaters, and conferences). The personal remote

## Page 196

194
microphone HAT is a commonly used device that captures sound via a microphone worn
by the person speaking. The device then transmits the sound wirelessly to a receiver worn
on the ear or attached to a hearing aid. If used in a classroom, for example, the device
brings the teacher’s voice directly to the student’s ear at a consistent volume that is above
the typical background noise, regardless of the distance between the teacher and student.
Another type of HAT known as a classroom audio distribution system (ADS), or sound-field
system, can be a good option for children with hearing loss that is mild or only affects one
ear. This system requires the teacher to wear a wireless microphone that transmits sound
to speakers that evenly distribute the teacher’s voice to all parts of the classroom. The
classroom ADS system can help to ensure that a hearing impaired student can hear what
the teacher is saying, even if the teacher is not directly facing the student or is speaking
from the other end of the classroom.
Bone Conduction Hearing Devices
A bone conduction hearing device may be useful for patients with conductive hearing loss
who cannot use conventional hearing aids due to problems such as a congenitally
undeveloped ear canal, or for individuals who are not good candidates for traditional
middle ear surgery [16]. For children who fall into this category, such a device can be
essential for normal speech and language development. A bone conduction hearing
device transmits sound waves directly to the inner ear by vibrating the bone of the skull,
which transfers the sound energy to the fluids of the cochlea. A traditional bone
conduction hearing aid consists of a bone oscillator or vibrator affixed to a fabric or metal
headband that is worn around the head with the oscillator tightly applied to the mastoid
bone or cortical bone above the ear. Alternatively, a bone conduction hearing device can
be surgically implanted (anchored) into the bone behind the ear in children age 5 years
and older.

Surgical Management of Hearing Loss for Patients
with Fanconi Anemia
In the general population, middle ear surgery improves conductive hearing loss in 75% to
90% of carefully selected candidates [17]. It should be noted, however, that sensorineural
hearing loss from inner ear or auditory nerve damage cannot be restored by ear surgery.
Below are a few causes of conductive hearing loss that may be surgically corrected in
patients with FA:
• Fusion of the malleus to a bony island under the eardrum
• Fixation of the ossicles to the bony walls of the middle ear cavity
• Discontinuity of the ossicles (one of the ossicles is not attached to the others)

## Page 197

195
• Scarring or bone growth around the stapes
• An absent ear canal
• Fluid in the middle ear
• Perforation of the eardrum
Assessing Candidacy for Surgery
Surgery is not suitable for every patient with conductive hearing loss. Patients with
moderate, severe, or profound sensorineural hearing loss are typically not candidates for
middle ear surgery. Individuals with serious medical conditions such as heart problems,
bleeding tendencies, and a high susceptibility for infection due to bone marrow failure
typically are not good candidates for surgery. Candidates for surgery must have normal
inner ear function as demonstrated by audiometric thresholds for on bone conduction
testing. The otologic surgeon should carefully evaluate the anatomy of the patient’s
middle and inner ear using high-resolution thin section CT scanning. This procedure
enables the surgeon to determine the possible cause of the conductive hearing loss and
gauge the potential success of surgery. In some patients, poor middle ear anatomy or
middle ear fluid precludes surgical intervention. It is through both the hearing test and the
temporal bone CT scan that a patient’s candidacy for middle ear surgery or canalplasty is
determined.
Middle Ear Surgery
Middle ear surgery can be performed in children ages 7 years or older who are capable of
cooperating with postoperative care and are beyond the age of frequent childhood ear
infections. In patients with an ear deformity known as microtia (in which the external part
of the ear, known as the pinna, is underdeveloped or absent), the timing of surgery will
depend on the family’s decision regarding reconstructive surgery for the pinna. The
options for management of microtia include the following:
• Microtia can be repaired using cartilage from the patient’s ribs. This procedure should
be performed prior to middle ear surgery.
• Microtia can be repaired using a synthetic implant, which is often made of high-
density polyethylene. This procedure should be performed after middle ear surgery.
• A prosthetic ear can be applied before or after middle ear surgery.
If the middle ear bones are immobile or absent, a surgical procedure called ossicular chain
reconstruction can be performed to replace the defective or missing ossicle(s) with a
prosthesis. The prostheses are typically made of artificial bone, titanium, or other
biocompatible composite materials. Surgery can be done using either local anesthesia and
sedation or general anesthesia, and typically takes about one to three hours.
If the ear canal is absent or very narrow, it can be reconstructed in a surgical procedure
called canalplasty. During this procedure, the otologist uses an otologic drill to remove
bone, thereby opening or widening the ear canal and freeing the ossicles. To restore

## Page 198

196
hearing to the ear, the surgeon constructs a tympanic membrane using a piece of
connective tissue. Then the reconstructed eardrum and bone of the ear canal are carefully
lined with a very thin skin graft called a split-thickness skin graft. The outer opening of the
ear canal, called the meatus, is widened, and the outer edge of the skin graft is delivered
through the meatus and sutured to the native skin of the pinna.
Complications associated with ear surgery are uncommon but may include:
• Further hearing loss or no hearing improvement (in less than 10% to 20% of surgeries).
Total deafness is extremely uncommon.
• Injury to the facial nerve that runs through the ear, which can cause facial paralysis.
This is extremely uncommon. Surgeons should use a device called a facial nerve
monitor during ear surgery to minimize this risk.
• Altered taste perception on the side of the tongue, which can last for a couple of
months.
• Persistent post-operative dizziness or ringing in the ears, both of which are quite
uncommon.
• Restenosis of the ear canal, which requires additional surgery.

Summary
Congenital hearing loss and/or malformations of the eardrum and
middle ear are more commonly associated with Fanconi anemia (FA)
than reported previously, although the hearing loss is typically mild
and conductive. All patients with FA should undergo a comprehensive
ear examination and audiologic evaluation by an otolaryngologist
and audiologist, respectively. Preferably, these medical providers
should be familiar with FA. Hearing problems that are FA-related
often can be successfully treated with either appropriate
amplification and/or surgical correction.

Chapter 12
Clinical Care of Hand
and Arm Abnormalities
in Fanconi Anemia

Introduction
Approximately half of all children with Fanconi anemia (FA) have
skeletal abnormalities, most (~70%) of which affect the upper
extremities. The most common abnormalities of the upper limbs
involve the thumb and radius. Children with these anomalies might
have a shortened or absent thumb, radius, or both, due to
incomplete growth. Therapy or surgery may be required to maximize
the function and appearance of the child’s hands and arms. By the
time most FA patients reach adulthood they have completed all
necessary hand surgeries in childhood and will not require regular
follow-up with their surgeon; however, occasional evaluation is
recommended to check for any developing problems. Unfortunately,
many pediatric facilities do not treat adults with pediatric problems.
Thus, patients should ask their pediatric hand surgeon to
recommend a physician who cares for similar hand and upper
extremity abnormalities in adults.

## Page 202

200
This chapter will describe five common concerns related to the hand
and arm in patients with FA:
• Underdeveloped, missing, or duplicated thumb
• Shortened or missing radius
• Shortened, curved forearm
• A hand that develops perpendicularly to the forearm
• Impaired movement in the wrist, fingers, and elbow
There are no standardized treatment procedures for congenital
hand and arm abnormalities; treatments must be tailored to each
child and family. The decision process is multi-factorial and requires
participation from the family, physician team, and a physical or
occupational therapist.

Initial Evaluation
Children born with limb abnormalities should be referred to an upper extremity specialist
within the first few months of life. This physician should be comfortable with and
proficient in the diagnosis and management of congenital limb anomalies. Ideally, a child
with Fanconi anemia (FA) should be referred to a hand and upper limb surgeon who
specializes in pediatrics.
Many children with upper limb abnormalities require physical or occupational therapy,
which may begin after the initial assessment. A therapist can help to stretch and
strengthen the affected limb, fabricate splints, and provide adaptive devices that maximize
the patient’s independence. As children get older and begin to perform increasingly
complex physical activities, many parents will worry that their child’s impairment is
worsening, but in reality, their child’s activities may simply require additional strength and
dexterity. A physical or occupational therapist can offer adaptive devices or techniques to
help the child accomplish these tasks.
Limb evaluation often occurs before a patient is diagnosed with FA. Because the radius
develops at the same time as many organ systems, the physician must evaluate the
patient’s entire body. Furthermore, radial deficiency is associated with numerous
syndromes, further emphasizing the need for a thorough investigation (Table 1). Many
children with VACTERL association have symptoms that are similar to those of children
with FA, a diagnostic dilemma that can be solved with the chromosomal breakage test (see
Chapter 2). Some patients with VACTERL-H actually have FA, and a combination of radial
and renal anomalies is an important clue in this diagnosis [1]. The precise clinical

## Page 203

201
indication for FA testing in children with limb anomalies is still evolving; however, every
child with isolated thumb or hand abnormalities or deficiencies with the radius should be
tested for FA (see Chapter 2).

Thumb Anomalies
In patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), the thumbs may be underdeveloped or completely
absent. The most common types of thumb anomalies that occur in children with FA have
been classified into five types of hypoplasia depending on the degree of
underdevelopment [2]:
Type I Deficiency
In Type I deficiency, the child’s thumb is slightly smaller than normal, but all of the thumb’s
structures (including the bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and joints) are present. This
mild deficiency may go unrecognized and many individuals are not diagnosed until later in
life when everyday activities such as buttoning a shirt or tying shoes become more
difficult.

## Page 204

202
Type II Deficiency
Type II deficiency is more involved and is characterized by a narrowing of the web space
between the thumb and index finger, absence of the thenar muscle at the base of the
thumb, and instability of the metacarpophalangeal joint in the middle of the thumb
(Figure 1A and B).

Type III Deficiency
A child with Type III deficiency possesses the same characteristics as a Type II deficiency,
as well as additional skeletal, muscular, and tendinous abnormalities. These abnormalities
usually involve tendons that arise within the forearm and travel into the thumb. Type III
anomalies are subdivided into Types III-A and III-B depending upon the presence or
absence, respectively, of a stable carpometacarpal joint at the base of the thumb.
Distinguishing Between Type III-A and Type III-B Thumb
Deficiencies
The clinical differentiation between Type III-A and Type III-B can be difficult. The child’s
pattern of thumb usage often helps discriminate between these types. Type III-B thumb
deficiencies produce an unstable thumb that will not be incorporated into pinching and
grasping motions; rather, the child will learn to pinch and grasp between the index finger
and the long digit, and the index finger will tend to rotate out of the palm toward a thumb
position. The differentiation is further complicated by the delayed maturation of the bones
at the base of the thumb; these bones (the trapezium and trapezoid) do not ossify or
become visible on x-ray until 4-6 years of age. Advanced imaging techniques such as
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal the extent of bone and cartilage
development; however, young children require general anesthesia during MRI. Ultrasound
A B

## Page 205

203
imaging shows promise as a tool for defining the trapezium and trapezoid anatomy
without the need for anesthesia. A thumb metacarpal that tapers to a point at the base of
the metacarpal on x-ray also is indicative of an unstable carpometacarpal joint.
Type IV Deficiency
Type IV deficiency, known as a pouce flottant (floating thumb) or residual digit, lacks
bones and muscles and is mainly comprised of skin and soft tissue (Figure 2).

‘pouce flottant’ or floating thumb). Source: Shriners Hospital for Children, Philadelphia
Unit.
Type V Deficiency
Type V deficiency hypoplasia is noted by the complete absence of a thumb (Figure 3).

thumb. Source: Shriners Hospital for Children, Philadelphia Unit.

Thumb classifications can guide treatment recommendations as shown in Table 2 [3-5].
The degree of hypoplasia and deficiency varies among children with FA. As a result,
treatment recommendations depend on the severity of the abnormality.

Treatments for Hypoplastic, Floating, and Absent
Thumbs
A thumb that is slightly smaller than normal (Type I) does not require surgical
reconstruction. Type II and III-A thumbs can be reconstructed; however, multiple elements
need to be addressed during surgery to maximize the thumb’s function (Figure 4A thru C):
• Tightness in the web space can be released using skin flaps to increase the space
between the thumb and index finger (Figure 4A).
• Thenar muscle deficiency can be treated by transferring tendon and/or muscle from
the ring or long finger to the thumb. Tendon transfer improves the active motion and
function of the thumb and has a negligible effect on the donor finger (Figure 4B).
• Metacarpophalangeal joint instability can be improved by reconstructing the
ligaments using tendon grafts to the ulnar and/or radial collateral ligaments at the
base of the thumb (Figure 4C). In cases with severe instability, fusion of the joint may
be the best option to provide a stable thumb for firm grasp.

The main distinction between a thumb that can be surgically reconstructed and a thumb
that requires amputation is the presence or absence of a stable base (e.g., a carpometacar-
pal joint). A thumb without a stable carpometacarpal joint (Types III-B, IV, and V) cannot be
reconstructed and should be removed. Clinical examination and x-ray will show marked
deficiencies (Figures 5 and 6).

space has widened and the index has rotated out of the palm. Source: Shriners Hospital for
Children, Philadelphia Unit.

In addition, Type III-B and IV thumbs are not functional, and the child will not incorporate
his/her thumb into pinch or grasp. The decision to remove a hypoplastic thumb without a
stable base often is a difficult process for parents and caregivers. Discussions with the

## Page 209

207
surgeon and conversations with families who have made similar decisions often are
helpful to parents tasked with making this decision for their child.
Following removal of a hypoplastic thumb, creation of an opposable thumb is critical for
grasp and object manipulation. The preferred procedure is pollicization, which involves
moving the index finger and its nerves, arteries, tendons, and muscles to the thumb
position. Pollicization requires meticulous surgical technique because the index finger
must be shortened, rotated, and reconstructed with the index muscles to give the
appearance and function of a thumb (Figure 7). The surgeon should be experienced with
this procedure. This procedure is generally performed when the child is between 6-24
months of age, depending on the health status of the child, the degree of forearm
deficiency, and the surgeon’s preference [2, 3]. The general medical health of a child with
FA also should be taken into consideration prior to surgery, especially if the child’s blood
counts are decreasing over time. Surgery can be safely performed in patients who have
platelet counts greater than 80,000. In reality, parents should not feel pressured to make
an immediate decision about surgery for their child. Some children undergo successful
surgery during adolescence, though acceptance of a change in the appearance and
composition of their hand can be more difficult.

appearance and function of a thumb. Source: Shriners Hospital for Children, Philadelphia
Unit.

## Page 210

208
The outcome of pollicization is directly related to the status of the index finger prior to
surgery. A mobile index finger can provide stability for grasp and mobility for fine pinch,
whereas a stiff index finger will provide a stable thumb for coarse grasping, but fine
pinching will be unlikely (Figure 8). Good results shortly after pollicization have been
shown to persist into adulthood [6, 7].

Other Thumb Anomalies
Although hypoplasia is the most common thumb anomaly in children with FA, other
abnormalities have been reported. For example, the thumb can possess an extra bone (an
anomaly referred to as a triphalangeal thumb) or can be duplicated (a condition called
pre-axial polydactyly). The exact prevalence of these rare anomalies is unknown.
Triphalangeal thumb
A triphalangeal thumb has an extra phalanx that can vary in size and shape (Figure 9). The
alignment and length of this type of thumb must be monitored during growth. An extra
phalanx that is small and normally shaped can be treated without surgery; however, a
small wedge-shaped phalanx may cause the thumb to curve as it grows, and treatment is
recommended. A small wedge-shaped bone can be surgically removed, and the ligaments
of the remaining bones can be reconstructed to form a functional joint. A large wedge-
shaped phalanx that causes the thumb to curve and become excessively long should not
be removed because joint instability is common following surgery. A better option involves
removing only the wedge-shaped portion of the abnormal phalanx and fusing the
remainder to an adjacent thumb bone. This procedure realigns the thumb, shortens the
elongated thumb, and eliminates the extra joint.

angulation; B) X-rays show an extra phalanx that is triangular in shape causing the
angulation. Source: Shriners Hospital for Children, Philadelphia Unit.

Pre-Axial Polydactyly
Pre-axial polydactyly, or duplication of the thumb, results in a hand that has more than
one thumb. The thumbs may be partial and appear fused together, or they may be
complete and separate from each other. Thumb duplications have been classified into
various types depending on the degree of skeletal replication (Table 3) [8, 9]. Treatment
requires salvaging portions of each duplicated structure, including bones, nails, tendons,
ligaments, joints, nerves, and blood vessels, to construct a properly aligned and functional
thumb (Figure 10) [10]. This procedure is not always straightforward and requires careful
intra-operative decision making. The soft tissues from the amputated thumb, including the
skin, nail, ligaments, and muscle, should be used to augment the retained thumb. The
articular surface of the joint may require realignment via osteotomy and modification via
cartilage shaving to optimize thumb function. Irrespective of treatment, the reconstructed
thumb may be smaller compared to a normal thumb and usually will lack some
movement.

Radial Deficiency
Radial deficiency is a skeletal condition in which the radius develops abnormally. The
radius can be slightly smaller than average, considerably smaller, or altogether absent.
The severity of radial deficiency is variable and can be determined through x-rays and
clinical examination. Radial deficiency is classified as follows [11, 12]:
• Type 0 and 1 deficiencies. These are the mildest forms and are characterized by little
or no shortening of the radius and negligible curvature in the ulna. The hand may be
tilted slightly inward toward the thumb side of the arm, a condition known as a radial
deviation of the wrist, and substantial thumb hypoplasia may be present that requires
treatment.
• Type 2 deficiency. This deficiency is characterized by a miniature radius that has
abnormalities in the growth plate (the region of the bone responsible for lengthening
the bone) and a moderate radial deviation of the wrist.
• Type 3 deficiency. This involves a partial substantial absence of the radius—most
commonly affecting the end of the bone that is closest to the wrist—and a severe
radial deviation of the wrist.
• Type 4 deficiency. In the most common type of radial deficiency, characterized by a
complete absence of the radius, the hand tends to develop perpendicularly to the
forearm (Figure 11A and B). In children with FA, a complete absence of the radius
typically occurs in conjunction with an absent thumb.

The maturation of the radius takes more time than usual in patients with radial deficiency; therefore, the differentiation between total and partial absence (Types 3 and 4) cannot be determined until the child is approximately three years of age. The different types of radial deficiencies have been combined into a classification scheme that includes the other upper limb abnormalities that are associated with radial deficiency, including thumb, carpal, and forearm abnormalities (Table 4).

Functional Consequences of Radial Deficiency
The outcome of radial deficiency depends on the severity of the abnormality. In a patient
with a Type 4 deficiency, the humerus may be shorter than expected and the elbow may
not bend properly. Furthermore, the forearm will always be shortened because the ulna is
approximately 60% of the normal length at birth and remains short even after the skeleton
has completely grown and matured [13]. The ulna also will be thickened and often curved
toward the absent radius. In cases of partial or complete absence of the radius, the
forearm will not be able to rotate, although some rotation may occur through the wrist or
carpal bones. The wrist may be shifted a variable amount towards the deficient radius, a
condition known as a radial deviation. The carpal bones will be delayed in their growth,
and the scaphoid and trapezium often are absent or hypoplastic. The index and middle
fingers can be stiff and slender and may have limited motion, whereas the ring and little
fingers are less affected and often have better motion.
The radial artery and nerve are often absent, although the ulnar nerve and artery are
normal [13]. An enlarged median nerve substitutes for the absent radial nerve and
communicates with its dorsal nerve branch, which is positioned in the fold between the
wrist and forearm, to provide sensation to the thumb side of the hand. It is critical that
surgeons are aware of the location of the dorsal branch when operating along the thumb
side of the wrist.

Radial Deficiency Treatment Considerations
The fundamental goals of treatment are to correct the radial deviation of the wrist to
balance the wrist and forearm while maintaining range of motion for the wrist and fingers.
Treatment also should strive to promote growth or lengthening of the forearm and
improve the overall function of the arm. A slightly shortened radius (Type 0 and 1
deficiencies) requires repeated stretching and occasionally requires a tendon transfer to
balance the wrist. These treatments are relatively straightforward. Partial or complete
absence of the radius is more common (Types 2, 3, and 4) and is entirely more difficult to
treat because the wrist has shifted toward the thumb side of the arm, shortening an
already undersized forearm, placing the forearm flexor and extensor tendons at an
awkward angle, and producing functional deficits. Children who have unilateral radial
deficiency may be able to compensate for any functional deficits using their unaffected
limb and, therefore, have a lower overall degree of functional impairment compared to
children who have bilateral radial deficiency. Finger and thumb abnormalities, if present,
also require consideration during the formulation of a treatment plan, as stiff fingers and a
deficient thumb will further hamper abilities to pinch and grasp.
Radial Deficiency Nonsurgical Treatments
The initial treatment for an absent radius should begin shortly after birth and consists of
stretching the soft tissues, including the tendons, ligaments, skin, and muscles. This
treatment is typically performed by both a physical or occupational therapist and the
caregiver. The therapist should be experienced in pediatric clinical interventions for the
hand. Stretching should be performed at every diaper change and is an important part of
the overall treatment plan. A splint can help to keep the hand in a straight alignment and
prevent the hand from developing perpendicularly to the forearm; however, fabrication of
a splint is difficult in a newborn with a shortened forearm because the splints tend to fall
off the arm. Therefore, this treatment is usually postponed until the forearm is long
enough to accommodate a splint. On occasion, the hand will develop in a perpendicular
position despite stretching and splinting treatments.
Radial Deficiency Surgical Treatment
Surgical treatment for Types 2, 3, and 4 deficiencies involves moving and centering the
wrist over the end of the ulna, which is the only substantial bone remaining within the
forearm. This procedure is known as “centralization” or “radialization” depending on the
exact position in which the wrist is placed, and remains the standard treatment for
realigning the wrist [14, 15]. Centralization involves releasing and reorganizing the tight
muscles and tendons of the wrist and positioning the hand over the end of the ulna (Figure
12).

## Page 217

215

the carpus onto the distal ulna. Source: Shriners Hospital for Children, Philadelphia Unit.
One end of a functioning tendon is then shifted from its original attachment site to the
wrist to rebalance the forces acting on the wrist, a procedure known as tendon transfer. If
the ulna has curved to an angle of 30 degrees or more, then it must be straightened via a
procedure called wedge osteotomy at the time of surgery. Once the surgery is complete,
the wrist is held in position by a stout wire (Figure 13), which can be removed 8-12 weeks
after surgery, although some surgeons prefer to leave the wire in place for as long as
possible. Once the wire has been removed, a splint should be used for at least 4-6 weeks.
The splint can be removed for physical therapy exercises, but most surgeons recommend
that the splint be worn during sleep until the child has stopped growing.

Centralization typically is performed when the child reaches approximately one year of
age. The initial correction is often impressive; however, the results are unpredictable and,
unfortunately, recurrence and complications are common. Furthermore, not all children
are candidates for centralization. The caregiver and surgeon must remember that
“function trumps form,” and many children function quite well despite having a deviated
wrist. Such children typically have a mobile and dexterous little finger along with a stiff
index finger, and are best able to pinch and grasp using their palm and the fingers on the

## Page 218

216
outside edge of the hand, known as an ulnar grasp pattern. In these children, straightening
the child’s wrist would move the outside edge and fingers downward and prevent the child
from approaching objects with this side of the hand. Therefore, straightening may be
detrimental to the child’s overall function and independence.
In an effort to maintain motion and obtain partial correction of the radial deviation, a
surgeon may find it useful to use a soft tissue release and skin flap to avoid entering the
joint and jeopardizing growth and motion [16]. High satisfaction rates and functionality
scores have been reported even though the forearm remained angulated after surgery.
This technique involves a bilobed flap to transpose the excess ulnar-sided soft tissue to the
radial side of the wrist (Figure 14). All underlying tight fascial bands are released and wrist
flexors with a purely radial deviating force are cut or transferred. The ulnocarpal joint is
not opened and a formal centralization is not performed. Concomitant ulnar osteotomy is
performed if angulation exceeds 30 degrees.

Contraindications for Surgery
Mild deformities with adequate support for the hand (Type 0 or 1) do not require surgery.
Surgery also is not advised for children with limited ability to bend the elbow. In these
children, the radial deviation of the wrist enables the hand to reach the mouth and
straightening the wrist would impair important tasks such as eating and reaching the face.
Alternative Treatments for Recurrent Radial Deviation
In severe cases, the radial deviation cannot be straightened and alternative measures are
necessary. Surgical options include removing a portion of the wrist bones via a procedure
called carpectomy, shaving some of the bone off the wrist end of the ulna, or applying a
device called an external fixator prior to centralization. An external fixator stretches the
soft tissues (including the tendons, ligaments, skin, and muscles) prior to centralization and
facilitates correction of the radial deviation [17-19]. The fixator may be unilateral with pins
or ringed multiplanar with wires (Figure 15).

distraction. A) Uniplanar device along the radial side of the forearm; B) Multiplanar device
for additional control of hand and forearm. Source: Shriners Hospital for Children,
Philadelphia Unit.
Numerous other technical modifications have been proposed to maintain alignment of the
wrist position. These include overcorrection of the radiation deviation, tendon transfers to
correct the alignment, prolonged wire fixation following centralization (leaving the wire in
place for longer than the typical 8-12 weeks), and microvascular free toe transfer.
A
B

## Page 220

218
Overcorrection of the radial deviation requires the patient’s hand to be positioned slightly
off-center into ulnar deviation to help prevent recurrence of the radial deviation.
Microvascular free toe transfer involves transplanting one of the second toes (without its
skin but with its arteries and veins intact) to the thumb side of the wrist to provide
additional support (Figure 16). A study of the outcomes of this procedure during an 8-year
period revealed that patients tended to have improved wrist motion and limited
recurrence [20]. This is a technically demanding operation, however, and complications
are common.

metatarsal affixed to the side of the distal ulna. Reprinted with permission [21].
Treatment Outcomes for Radial Deviation Correction
Unfortunately, no single treatment method consistently and permanently corrects the
radial deviation, balances the wrist, and allows continued growth of the forearm [14, 15].
Recurrence can prove frustrating to the child, parent, and surgeon (Figure 17). Maintaining
the wrist on the end of the ulna without sacrificing wrist mobility or stunting forearm
growth remains a daunting task. Many factors contribute to recurrence, including the
inability to obtain complete correction at surgery, inadequate release of the tightness in
the soft tissues, and failure to balance the forces acting on the wrist. Prolonged wire
fixation and use of a splint may help minimize recurrence. In some children, there is a
natural tendency for the shortened forearm and hand to deviate in a radial direction for
hand-to-mouth use. Fortunately, recurrence is not always associated with a loss of
function. Although patients with severe radial deviation may have limitations in their
range of motion and strength, long-term studies have found that they function
independently and participate in a high number of activities that is comparable to children
with less severe deformities [22-25].

## Page 221

219

an infant. Source: Shriners Hospital for Children, Philadelphia Unit.
A 2017 study examined the long-term outcome of surgical or nonsurgical treatment of
children with radial deficiency [26]. Non-surgical patients had the most radial deviation
and forearm angulation. Soft tissue release and bilobed flap lessened the radial deviation
without causing physeal arrest and maintaining good wrist motion. External fixation and
subsequent centralization or radialization achieved the best angular correction but
resulted in the decreased wrist motion and shortened the ulnar length. Microvascular toe
transfer that connected the distal ulna to the carpus resulted in the best motion while
maintaining good ulnar length.
The management of recurrent deformity must be individualized to each patient and the
specifics of his/her deformity. Similarly, the indication for forearm lengthening to
overcome the inherent problem of a shortened forearm have yet to be delineated.
Lengthening surgery is offered to patients and families interested in correcting the
deformity and willing to comply with a long and arduous recovery. The procedure, called
distraction osteogenesis, involves inducing new bone growth, typically by pulling on the
bone in a controlled manner using an external fixator (Figure 18). Lengthening is a
sophisticated form of treatment that introduces additional complications such as infection

## Page 222

220
at the insertion sites of the external fixator, fracture of the regenerated bone, and finger
stiffness. These complications must be discussed prior to surgery. Forearm lengthening is
laborious and may require the device to remain in place for extended periods of time,
sometimes up to a year. In general, children with unilateral forearm shortening tend to be
bothered by the asymmetry between the forearms and request lengthening more often
than children with bilaterally shortened forearms, who have symmetry between the arms.
Ultimately, fusion of the joint between the wrist and ulna may be contemplated in certain
instances to keep the wrist straight [27]. Wrist fusion results in a permanently stiff, straight
wrist. Careful assessment of hand usage and compensatory motion is mandatory prior to
this procedure. A functional evaluation by a physical therapist is a valuable preoperative
tool. Painstaking measures should be taken to ensure that wrist fusion does not lead to
loss of function.

Summary
Upper extremity skeletal abnormalities such as thumb and radial
deficiencies are common in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA).
Evaluation of skeletal abnormalities typically precedes diagnosis of
FA and can be used as criteria for further evaluation during diagnosis
of the disease. Mild to severe hypoplastic thumb deficiencies may
require surgical intervention depending on the severity of the
anomaly and other patient-specific factors. Radial deficiencies are
variable and characterized by a radius that can be smaller than
average, or altogether absent. The treatment for radial abnormalities
ranges from soft tissue stretching for mild cases to surgical
intervention for more severe cases. The goals of treatment are to
correct the radial deviation while promoting forearm lengthening and
improving the overall function of the arm. Treatment for radial
abnormalities, regardless of the modality used, may not be permanent
and recurrence is possible.

Chapter 13
Brief Guide to Clinical Care
for Patients with Fanconi
Anemia

Introduction
This chapter is a brief clinical guide that is a compendium of
information provided in all other chapters in this book. It is not all-
inclusive and should not take the place of reading the
comprehensive information provided in other chapters. Many of the
tests and procedures mentioned in this chapter will not be
appropriate for every individual patient, nor does this brief guide
present an exhaustive list of possible tests or treatments that each
FA patient could or should undergo. Rather, it should be used at the
discretion of the patient’s physician and should be tailored to the
needs of the individual patient and his or her family.
The brief guide covers the following areas:
• Diagnosis of FA
• General clinical care
• Bone marrow failure and hematopoietic cell transplant
• Reproductive health and gynecologic cancer
• Head and neck cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
• The adult patient with FA and clinical care transition

## Page 228

226
Diagnosis of Fanconi Anemia
The following should be used as criteria to perform diagnostic testing for Fanconi anemia
(FA) (see Chapter 2):
• All children with multiple anatomic abnormalities, particularly those that are grouped
with the acronym PHENOS (skin Pigmentation, small Head, small Eyes, Nervous
system, Otology, and Short stature) and those described in the VACTERL-H (Vertebral,
Anal, Cardiac, Tracheo-esophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, Renal, upper Limb and
Hydrocephalus) association.
• All children and adults with aplastic anemia.
• All patients with a 3q gain on cytogenetic evaluation.
• All full siblings of patients with FA, regardless of whether they show physical signs or
symptoms, must be tested to rule out FA and to determine whether they are matched
sibling donors for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).
• Young adults that present at atypical ages for specific malignancies, including
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck or anogenital region.
• Individuals with excessive toxicity after treatment with chemotherapeutics commonly
used to treat cancers such as myeloid leukemia and head and neck or anogenital SCC.
Laboratory Tests for Fanconi Anemia
Physicians who suspect that a patient may have FA should refer the patient to a
hematologist and/or clinical geneticist or genetic counselor who can arrange for
diagnostic testing (see Chapter 2 for complete testing guidelines).
Anyone suspected of having FA should be tested using a diepoxybutane (DEB) or
mitomycin C (MMC) chromosome breakage test of blood lymphocytes. The DEB/MMC test
should be performed at a clinically certified laboratory that has expertise in FA diagnostic
testing.
If diagnostic test results of blood lymphocytes are negative, no further testing is necessary,
unless there is strong clinical suspicion. If the result is negative, or equivocal, skin
fibroblasts can be used for additional chromosome breakage testing. In addition,
molecular testing for other chromosome instability or DNA repair syndromes can be
performed.
If the chromosome breakage test is positive, a targeted FA gene panel and
deletion/duplication analysis should be performed. If results from this test are negative,
whole exome or whole genome sequencing can be performed.

## Page 229

227
General Clinical Care
Fanconi anemia (FA) leads to numerous bodily complications that require specific clinical
care approaches. This section provides an overview of guidelines for monitoring and
treating the body systems covered in the chapters of this guide.
Audiologic Care
Patients with FA should be examined by an otolaryngologist at diagnosis to assess for
possible hearing loss or structural abnormalities of the eardrums and/or middle ear bones.
If the patient has structural abnormalities, the otolaryngologist may consider possible
surgical intervention to improve hearing (see Chapter 11).
An audiologist should assess the patient at the time of diagnosis to determine whether an
amplification system would be useful if hearing loss is documented. These systems can be
used for children as young as 4 months. The audiologist can help the family arrange for
speech and language therapy, if needed, and should also contact the patient’s school
district to inquire about early intervention services.
If a patient with FA receives potentially ototoxic drugs (i.e., that can impair hearing), such
as certain intravenous antibiotics and/or chemotherapy drugs used during hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT), the patient’s auditory function should be monitored with serial
audiograms.
Dermatologic Care
Patients with suspicious nevi or other abnormal skin lesions should be examined by a
dermatologist (see Chapter 8). All patients with FA should limit sun exposure and wear
sunscreen to reduce the risk of skin cancer. Post-HCT patients should limit sun exposure to
reduce the risk of cutaneous chronic graft-versus-host disease.
Endocrine Care
Many children and adults with FA have endocrine problems, including growth hormone
deficiency, hypothyroidism, pubertal delay, or diabetes (see Chapter 10).  To ensure
optimal care, the patient should consult with an endocrinologist or pediatric
endocrinologist.
At diagnosis and annually, each FA patient should receive a thorough baseline endocrine
evaluation to monitor the following:
• Growth. Nutritional and medical causes for poor growth should be identified as early
as possible for optimal treatment. Growth in children with FA should be followed
clinically. Height, determined on a stadiometer, should be plotted on a growth chart
at least annually.

## Page 230

228
• Puberty. Onset of puberty, which is often delayed in individuals with FA, should be
evaluated by at least annual physical examinations to evaluate stage and progression.
After age 12, pubertal hormone concentrations should be obtained at least every two
years as needed to assess pubertal progression.
• Glucose tolerance. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with insulin levels
should be obtained and repeated as determined by the endocrinologist.
• Diet and exercise. All persons diagnosed with FA should engage in regular exercise
and consume a healthful diet that provides adequate calories and follows the
guidelines of the American Diabetes Association. Concentrated sweets should be
avoided.
Gastrointestinal Care
Patients with gastrointestinal or hepatic concerns should be seen by a gastroenterologist.
A number of patients with FA have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as poor oral intake,
nausea, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea resulting in a failure to thrive. These problems
may affect nutrition and/or quality of life in patients with FA. The physician should ask the
patient and family about gastrointestinal symptoms during routine clinic visits, as patients
often do not disclose these concerns voluntarily (see Chapter 9). The hepatic
complications of androgens also are a concern in patients with FA. Liver enzymes should
be monitored every 3-6 months in patients receiving androgens, and a liver ultrasound
every 6-12 months is recommended.
Hand and Arm Abnormalities
Patients with hand or arm abnormalities should be assessed at the time of diagnosis by an
orthopedic surgeon with specific experience in congenital limb anomalies. It is very
important that the surgeon hold a Certificate of Added Qualification in Hand Surgery. Early
referral of the patient to an orthopedic upper extremity specialist is important to obtain
the best possible functional and cosmetic outcome for arm and thumb abnormalities that
are common in FA.
Oral Care
All patients with FA should have regular dental examinations at least every six months by a
dentist who is well versed in FA head and neck squamous cell carcinoma risks. The
examination should include a thorough screening for possible oral cancer. Digital dental x-
rays provide limited radiation exposure and may be required to monitor for cavities and
diagnose gum and bone diseases that cannot be detected by visual inspection. However,
because patients with FA have increased sensitivity to radiation, use of dental x-rays
should be limited as much as possible.
Other dental procedures (e.g., braces) should be discussed with the FA hematologist. Bone
marrow failure (BMF) contributes to significant oral health problems, including increased

## Page 231

229
bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Oral care is essential for treating and managing oral
complications for patients with FA both pre and post-HCT. Patients with FA should not
have dental cleaning, extraction, or other invasive procedures after HCT until the immune
system has recovered. If urgent care is required, supportive care may be needed (see
Chapter 6).
Polypharmacy
Patients with FA often take several different prescription medication simultaneously
throughout their lives. The involvement of multiple subspecialists introduces the risk that
medications prescribed by one physician will interact adversely with those prescribed by
another or that the use of non-prescription drugs may interact adversely with prescribed
medication. It is extremely important that all subspecialists communicate with the primary
physician or hematologist to coordinate care. The patient should share all prescription and
non-prescription drugs, dietary supplements, and homeopathic agents used with the
primary physician and subspecialists.
Skeletal Health
Hematopoietic cell transplantation may increase the risk of osteoporosis/osteopenia for
any patient regardless of underlying diagnosis. The pre-transplant recommendation for FA
patients is to obtain a bone density screening (DXA scan) at age 14, with follow-up as
needed. For patients who have undergone a transplant, a DXA scan should be obtained
one year post-transplant, with ongoing monitoring as needed. Independent of
transplantation, premature menopause is a high-risk factor for reduced bone mass and
gynecological experts who treat adult female patients with FA recommend careful
monitoring of bone health. Long-term treatment with corticosteroids also increases the
risk of osteoporosis/osteopenia in both male and female patients with FA.

Bone Marrow Failure
Most patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) will develop bone marrow failure (BMF); however,
the age of onset can be highly variable, even among affected siblings. The absence of BMF
does not exclude the diagnosis of FA, however. All patients with FA should be monitored by
a hematologist with experience in FA, regardless of whether the patient has bone marrow
involvement. Chapter 3 provides a detailed overview for clinical monitoring of BMF in
patients with FA.

## Page 232

Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is currently the only therapy available to cure
patients with FA of marrow aplasia and prevent progression to myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
Pre-Transplant Precautions for Patients with Fanconi Anemia
The FA diagnosis must be confirmed before proceeding to HCT. The donor, if related to the
patient, must be tested to rule out the possibility of FA. The physician should take ample
time to discuss childbearing options with the patient and family before HCT, as the
procedure may affect future fertility.
After Transplant Care
Table 2 in Chapter 3 provides a comprehensive schedule of the long-term follow-up
examinations needed for FA patients after HCT. Long-term care plans should be tailored to
the specific needs of each individual FA patient under the supervision of a long-term care
team comprised of the HCT physician, primary hematologist, and a multi-disciplinary team
of specialists. Early complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), graft failure,
organ toxicity, and infections should be monitored. Abnormal liver enzymes and blood
counts should be monitored. Testing for viruses should be performed early on as well. Late
complications should be monitored and include chronic GvHD, organ toxicity (i.e., cardiac,
pulmonary, renal), endocrinopathies (i.e., diabetes, hypothyroidism, gonadal dysfunction,
growth failure), osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, infertility, and cancer.
Most transplant centers will expect patients to remain near the facility for a minimum of
100 days, during which time the patient is at highest risk for developing immunologic
complications (i.e., graft rejection, GvHD, and opportunistic infections) associated with
HCT. Patients with FA should be screened for immune reconstitution one year after HCT.
The primary care physician should discuss the exact timing of immunizations with the
patient’s transplant physician. All patients and their family household members should
receive the intramuscular formulation of the influenza vaccine on an annual basis. After
HCT, the patient’s hematologist will determine how often blood counts and bone marrow
tests are needed (see Chapter 3).
Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
Patients with FA are at high risk of developing MDS and AML and should be monitored
closely to assess for possible onset. Serial marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis
should be performed annually in patients who have not undergone HCT to identify clonal
evolution to MDS or AML. There is no standard therapy for FA patients with MDS or AML.
Treatment options include HCT with or without prior induction chemotherapy.

Hematopoietic Cell Transplant in Adult Patients with Fanconi Anemia
In patients with FA, HCT yields the best results when performed in the first decade of life
and before the onset of myeloid malignancies, solid tumors, or transfusions. Increasingly,
however, adult patients with FA are undergoing transplant, made possible by advances
such as reduced intensity cytoreduction regimens and T-cell depletion methods designed
to decrease the incidence of GvHD. To date, there are no published trials of adult FA
transplant; however, data are slowly becoming available. A multicenter retrospective
analysis of 199 adult patients with FA transplanted between 1991 and 2014 was recently
published [1]. Non-relapse mortality at 96 months was 56% with an overall survival of 34%,
which improved with more recent transplants.

Reproductive Health
Female patients with FA may experience a variety of gynecologic issues, including
structural abnormalities, delayed puberty, decreased fertility, early menopause, and a high
risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lower genital tract, which includes cervical,
vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancers. Male patients with FA may have numerous structural
abnormalities of the reproductive system and extremely low sperm count that affect
fertility.
Gynecologic Cancer
Proper prevention, surveillance, and treatment of anogenital SCC in female patients with
FA are essential. Beginning at age 13, female patients with FA should have annual
examinations by a gynecologist for visual inspection of the external genitalia. Once
sexually active, or by age 18, female patients with FA should receive comprehensive
annual gynecologic exams with cervical cytology testing. Clinical experts recommend
screening for gynecological cancer every 6-12 months because squamous intraepithelial
lesions (SIL) can rapidly progress to cancer. Anal pap smears and anoscopy may be
considered in female patients with FA who have vulvar disease.
As with the general population, colposcopy is appropriate in the setting of abnormal
cytology or suspicious lesions noted on examination. Suspicious genital tract lesions
should be biopsied. Female patients diagnosed with anogenital SCC should be referred
immediately to a gynecologic oncologist. Early referral may enable surgical treatment of
the cancer, thereby avoiding the risks associated with chemotherapy or radiation for
patients with FA (see Chapter 7 for complete guidelines on gynecologic cancer).

## Page 234

232
Human Papillomavirus Vaccination
It is recommended that patients with FA follow the current guidelines from the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends routine HPV vaccination
for both females and males. The currently available vaccine protects against acquiring the
nine HPV types that are most commonly associated with cervical, vaginal, and vulvar
cancer, and genital warts. Ideally, the vaccine should be given before the patient is
exposed to HPV through oral sex or sexual intercourse. It is recommended that patients
with FA be vaccinated starting at age 9. Regardless of prior HPV vaccination, patients with
FA should be vaccinated after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), when deemed
appropriate (see Chapter 7).
Primary Ovarian Insufficiency
Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is common in female patients with FA. It is
characterized by a spectrum of low ovarian reserve, declining ovarian function, reduced
fertility, and estrogen deficiency. It is recommended that female patients with FA be
treated either with oral contraceptive pills (if the patient is sexually active and pregnancy
is not desired) or postmenopausal hormone therapy, which consists of low to physiologic
doses of estrogen and progestins. Either approach is superior to no therapy regarding the
effects on bone and other aspects of health.
Fertility and Pregnancy
Pregnancies have been reported in female patients with FA, in both those who were
treated with HCT and those who were not. Physicians should discuss childbearing options
with female patients with FA before HCT, as the transplant may further affect the patient’s
future fertility. The patient should not take androgens during pregnancy. While pregnancy
for women with FA who have not been transplanted is not life-threatening, it nonetheless
likely will impact onset or severity of bone marrow failure, requiring intensified
surveillance. The pregnancy should be considered high risk and should be co-managed by
a maternal/fetal medicine specialist and a hematologist. Pregnancies after HCT have
occurred, but they are rare.
Menopause
Female patients with FA usually experience premature menopause. Thus, the physician
should consider the patient’s risk of post-menopausal conditions such as osteoporosis,
cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and the management of hot flashes using hormone
therapy.

233
Breast Cancer Screening
Five of the genes implicated in Fanconi anemia (FA) are breast cancer susceptibility genes:
FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C, and FANCS/BRCA1.
However, breast cancer risk for individuals with FA who harbor variants in these genes or
other FA genes has not been established; therefore, more research is needed to develop
guidelines for breast cancer screening for female patients with FA (regardless of their
specific FA variant). It is unclear whether the current mammography screening
recommendations for carriers also apply to individuals with FA, as FA patients have an
elevated sensitivity to radiation exposure due to their underlying genetic defects in DNA
repair. The long-term risks of radiation exposure must be weighed against the benefits of
early detection.
Reproductive Issues in Male Patients with Fanconi Anemia
Developmental anomalies of the genital tract are more frequent in male patients with FA
than in the general population. Many male patients with FA may have the following
reproductive issues:
• Delayed puberty
• Undescended testicles and hypospadias, a condition where the urethra opens on the
underside of the penis
• Small testes for their age and pubertal status, most likely reflecting reduced Sertoli
cell mass and spermatogenesis
• Testicles fail to descend
• Low levels of sex hormone production due to underlying problems with the pituitary
gland or hypothalamus
• Azoospermia

Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Patients with FA are at extremely high risk for developing cancer at an early age, and in
particular, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Therefore, implementation
of early and lifelong surveillance, regardless of whether the patient has undergone a bone
marrow transplant, is essential.
Prevention
• Maintain good oral hygiene and visit a dentist and an expert in head and neck cancer
detection every six months.
• Minimize exposure to dietary alcohol and do not use mouthwashes containing
alcohol.
• Avoid smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke; vaping also should be avoided.

## Page 236

234
• Receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series, beginning at age 9 for
both male and female patients with FA (see Chapter 7 for full guidelines).
Surveillance and Treatment
• Beginning at age 10, patients with FA should be examined every six months by an
otolaryngologist, oral surgeon, or other doctor who is experienced in head and neck
cancer detection and is familiar with FA. The exam should include a careful
exploration of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.
• Suspicious lesions in the oral cavity should be brushed immediately using a brush
biopsy. If pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions are identified via brush biopsy, incisional
biopsy must be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
• Malignant lesions must be treated immediately, as cure can best be achieved via early
surgical removal. Treatment should be discussed with a hematologist/oncologist with
experience in FA.
• Aggressive monitoring by the treating surgeon is required for those previously treated
for head and neck cancer.

Adult Patients with Fanconi Anemia
Fanconi anemia (FA) is no longer an exclusive childhood illness. Increased recognition of
disease diversity, improved hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), better supportive care
options, and early detection have improved the likelihood that patients with FA will live
into adulthood. It is now estimated that approximately 80% of patients with FA will survive
beyond 18 years of age [2, 3]. The major healthcare issues of the adult FA population have
been described and discussed in database reports by the International Fanconi Anemia
Registry, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-based North American Survey, and the
German Fanconi Anemia Registry [4-7]. However, the adult population with FA has not
been studied as a patient subgroup in any prospective studies published to date. Many
major health issues unique to this subpopulation of patients with FA are just beginning to
be recognized and evaluated.
Subgroups of Adult Patients with Fanconi Anemia
The three general subgroups of adult patients with FA have both common and divergent
concerns, and often require different strategies for management and follow-up. All adult
patients with FA, regardless of which subgroup they are in, are at high risk for the
development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or anogenital SCC (female
patients) and require aggressive surveillance (see Chapters 5 and 7). The three subgroups
of FA adult patients are summarized as follows:

## Page 237

235
Adult Patients Diagnosed in Childhood Who Have Not Had a Transplant
Although a few of these patients have not developed bone marrow failure or hematologic
malignancies (and may not do so in their lifetime), all of these patients require scheduled
hematologic evaluations. Patients in this group who develop bone marrow failure as
adults may require an HCT.
Adult Patients Diagnosed in Childhood Who Have Had a Transplant
This population is increasing in number because of the increased success of HCT. The
major issues facing this population are the follow-up and treatment of non-hematologic
FA issues and short- and long-term complications of HCT, such as the treatment of chronic
graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). These patients face a relatively small risk of hematologic
relapse, for which they require continued hematologic evaluation.
Adult Patients Who Are Diagnosed in Adulthood
This is a small but growing population due to increased recognition of the disease
diversity. At least 10% of patients with FA are 16 years or older at the time of diagnosis [8].
Occasionally, an adult is diagnosed with FA when the family members of a newly
diagnosed individual are screened. More commonly, an adult is diagnosed with FA because
of a clinically atypical cancer diagnosis or an abnormal response to cancer chemotherapy
or radiation therapy. One study found that in more than 20% of patients with FA who
developed solid tumors, the diagnosis of FA in these patients was made only after the
appearance of their cancer [9]. Many of these patients were diagnosed as adults and very
often had no, or minor, phenotypic abnormalities and normal blood counts.  Mosaicism
may explain some of the cases where a cancer diagnosis precedes the diagnosis of FA [9].
Transitioning to Adult Clinical Care
The transition from pediatric- to adult-oriented care is an important issue facing young
adults with many complex and chronic illnesses. Although the authors are not aware of
specific transition programs for young adults with FA, there is ample evidence to support
the benefits of an anticipated and coordinated transition process [10-12] that is outlined as
follows:
• This transition must be seen as a process, not as an abrupt transfer of services.
• Successful transitions are often initiated during the late teenage years, and
accompanied by family and patient education about the future transition [11, 12].
• Transition timing should be individualized and not dependent on age.
• Pediatric FA specialists may remain involved in long-term patient care decisions,
especially regarding the screening and treatment of secondary cancers.
• Patients transplanted at larger centers may be followed in long-term survivor clinics
where healthcare needs are addressed by a multi-disciplinary team.

## Page 238

236
Creating an Adult Clinical Care Plan
The adult clinical care plan should include surveillance and treatment of all aspects of FA,
including:
• Preventive healthcare and wellness check-ups.
• Ongoing hematological evaluation of patients who have not undergone an HCT.
• Continuation of rigorous cancer prevention and surveillance, especially of head and
neck and anogenital SCC.
• Screening for vascular and cardiac disease after HCT.
• Screening for endocrine-related conditions, such as abnormal thyroid function,
diabetes mellitus, reduced fertility, and osteoporosis.
• Screening for effects of treatment that manifest later in life, such as cataracts.
• Complete all standard vaccinations including human papillomavirus vaccination to
prevent SCC.
• Gynecological consultations to screen for and prevent cancer, to monitor menses, and
to manage fertility and menopause issues.
Psychosocial Issues in Adult Patients with Fanconi Anemia
The magnitude of potential psychosocial problems has not been assessed in FA adults and
should be assessed in patient cohorts in the future. However, a recent follow-up study of
adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia reveals that these patients
experienced more functional impairments in mental health, and engaged in limited
activities compared with their siblings [13]. In addition, rates of marriage, college
graduation, employment, and health insurance coverage were all lower in FA patients in
comparison to controls. It is expected that FA adults may experience similar issues. For
these reasons, the adult FA patient may need extensive vocational, educational, and
psychosocial support and guidance. Medical compliance also may become a challenge,
particularly during the transition period. For individuals who are newly diagnosed in
adulthood, the ramifications of the diagnosis on established relationships (with spouses,
parents, employers, etc.) may be extreme.

Summary
The brief clinical guide for patients with FA is an overview of clinical
recommendations provided in all other chapters in this book. It should
be used as a guide only and is not intended to provide comprehensive
clinical care guidelines for each unique patient with FA. Fanconi
anemia is a heterogenous disease that affects all bodily systems. The
complexity of the disease requires a holistic approach to wellness and
treatment for each patient. Multi-disciplinary clinical care is essential
for patients with FA and should be offered in a coordinated fashion by
a team with expertise in FA. This is particularly important for adult
patients with FA, who are quickly becoming the largest subpopulation
of FA patients. Adults with FA have a unique set of clinical challenges
that are still not well understood. Research on this subgroup is
desperately needed in order to improve their clinical care.

Fanconi Anemia Clinical Care Guidelines, Fifth Edition, is a publication of the Fanconi
Anemia Research Fund. The fifth edition is a revision of the fourth edition published in
2014. The contributing authors are physicians or clinical care providers with expertise in
treating patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). The fifth edition provides evidence-based
recommendations from published peer-reviewed medical literature and is geared toward
clinical providers as the primary intended audience. Patients and families who wish to
secure optimal treatment by improving their understanding of FA may also benefit from
this edition.
The fifth edition starts with a brief summary of the molecular mechanisms of the FA DNA
repair pathway and the diagnostic testing process for FA. Subsequent chapters examine
more specific health issues faced by people with FA, including hematologic issues,
squamous cell carcinoma, oral and dental care, gynecologic care, dermatologic care,
gastrointestinal issues, endocrine disorders, hearing and ear issues, and skeletal
abnormalities. The guidelines conclude with a summary of clinical care recommendations
for patients with FA.
