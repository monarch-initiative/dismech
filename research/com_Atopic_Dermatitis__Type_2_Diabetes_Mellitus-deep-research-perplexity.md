# The Comorbidity Between Atopic Dermatitis and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Comprehensive Analysis of Epidemiological Evidence and Mechanistic Insights

The relationship between atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting up to 20 percent of children and 10 percent of adults globally[5], and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders worldwide, remains one of the most contentious topics in contemporary dermatology and endocrinology. While recent epidemiological investigations have documented a significantly elevated risk of T2DM in adults with newly diagnosed AD, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.44 and a 95 percent confidence interval of 1.27-1.63[2][8], earlier meta-analytic evidence paradoxically suggested that AD is protective against T2DM, with odds ratios indicating approximately 31 percent lower prevalence of AD among patients with established diabetes[1][19]. This apparent contradiction reflects not merely conflicting study findings but rather fundamental questions about disease chronology, shared genetic architecture, and the bidirectional nature of inflammatory comorbidities. Through systematic examination of prospective cohort studies, case-control investigations, Mendelian randomization analyses, and experimental models, this comprehensive review synthesizes current understanding of the AD-T2DM comorbidity nexus, delineates proposed mechanistic pathways involving immune dysregulation, skin barrier dysfunction, and metabolic perturbations, and addresses critical methodological considerations that may explain discordant findings across the literature.

## Epidemiological Evidence for a Positive Association Between Atopic Dermatitis and Type 2 Diabetes

### Contemporary Cohort and Case-Control Studies Demonstrating Increased T2DM Risk

The most compelling recent evidence supporting an association between AD and subsequent T2DM development emerges from large-scale, prospective cohort studies employing propensity score matching and rigorous covariate adjustment. A particularly robust investigation utilizing the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database in South Korea conducted a propensity score-matched cohort study comparing 36,692 adults with newly diagnosed AD to an equal number of matched control subjects without AD history, followed from 2002 to 2015[2]. The results demonstrated a significantly elevated risk of T2DM in the AD cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.44 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.27-1.63, p<0.001), representing a 44 percent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in AD patients compared to matched controls[2][26][50]. Notably, this elevated risk remained consistent across subgroup analyses stratified by sex, age, and body mass index, and sensitivity analyses employing different definitions of T2DM and AD continued to demonstrate significant associations, thereby strengthening confidence in the observed relationship[2][26]. The prospective design of this study, with AD diagnosis preceding T2DM assessment, establishes temporal precedence critical for causal inference and distinguishes this work from cross-sectional investigations that cannot establish directionality.

A more recent analysis using TriNetX data, published in 2025, further corroborates these findings by demonstrating increased risk of T2DM in patients with atopic dermatitis through age-stratified analysis[39]. This consistency across different databases, geographic regions, and study designs strengthens the epidemiological evidence supporting a genuine association between AD and T2DM rather than attributing findings to systematic bias or methodological artifacts. The magnitude of increased risk—approximately 44 percent—is clinically meaningful and comparable in magnitude to well-established metabolic risk factors, suggesting that AD warrants consideration as a T2DM risk marker in clinical practice. Furthermore, the consistency of findings across both male and female populations, multiple age groups, and varying obesity levels indicates that the AD-T2DM association is not merely a manifestation of confounding by adiposity or sex-specific metabolic differences, though these factors undoubtedly modify the relationship.

### Mendelian Randomization Evidence for Causal Association

Beyond observational epidemiology, Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, which leverage genetic variation as natural experiments to infer causality while minimizing confounding and reverse causality bias, provide compelling support for a causal contribution of AD to T2DM risk. A comprehensive MR study examining the causal relationship between genetically predicted AD and both type 1 and type 2 diabetes found that genetically predicted AD led to a significantly higher risk of T1D (odds ratio, 1.19; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.05-1.34; p=0.006) and T2D (odds ratio, 1.07; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02-1.11; p=0.003) based on inverse variance weighting methodology[11][45][60]. These findings, derived from the EArly Genetics & Lifecourse Epidemiology (EAGLE) eczema consortium meta-analysis of 21,399 AD cases and 95,464 controls, employed 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms explaining 6.76 percent of the genetic variance of AD, all with F-statistics greater than 10 indicating the absence of weak instrumental variables[11][45]. The complementary analyses using alternative MR methodologies, including weighted median and mode-based estimation approaches, provided similar positive results, and sensitivity analyses detected no significant horizontal pleiotropy, thereby reinforcing the robustness of causal inferences[11][45]. These MR findings are particularly important because they suggest that genetic factors predisposing to AD independently increase T2DM susceptibility, implying shared genetic architecture and biological pathways linking these two conditions beyond confounding by shared environmental exposures or intermediate factors.

## Contradictory Evidence and the Historical Protective Association

### Meta-Analytic Evidence of Lower AD Prevalence in Diabetes

Paradoxically, earlier meta-analytic evidence pointed in the opposite direction, suggesting that AD is actually protective against T2DM. A systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association between AD and diabetes mellitus pooled six studies published primarily in Europe and Canada, including a total of 162,882 patients with 12,164 AD events across case-control, retrospective, and cross-sectional designs[1][19]. The pooled analysis demonstrated that AD was significantly less common among patients with established diabetes mellitus compared to those without diabetes, with an odds ratio of 0.69 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67-0.72, p<0.001) indicating approximately 31 percent lower odds of AD among diabetic patients[1][19]. No heterogeneity was observed between studies (Chi-square=4.12, df=5, I²=0 percent, p=0.53), suggesting that the protective association was consistent across investigations[1][19]. The conclusion of this analysis was that AD appears protective from diabetes mellitus, although the authors acknowledged the difficulty in establishing causality and recommended further investigation of genetic and environmental factors linking these conditions[1][19].

This apparent paradox—contemporary cohort studies showing increased T2DM risk in AD patients versus older meta-analytic evidence suggesting AD protects against diabetes—likely reflects multiple methodological and biological factors. First, the studies pooled in the protective association meta-analysis predominantly examined cross-sectional associations or assessed unspecified type 2 diabetes without validated definitions, whereas more recent prospective cohort investigations employ stringent criteria for diabetes diagnosis and follow patients forward in time[1][19][4]. Second, the cross-sectional nature of earlier studies precludes determination of temporal sequence, making it impossible to distinguish whether AD precedes or follows diabetes onset[1][4]. Third, individuals with long-standing diabetes may have undergone substantial metabolic and immune remodeling over years of disease progression and treatment, potentially altering the likelihood of AD development through mechanisms distinct from those operating in newly diagnosed diabetes[1][4]. Fourth, the use of different study designs—case-control studies identify prevalent cases at a single point in time, while prospective cohorts follow disease incidence—can yield divergent associations depending on whether disease duration, severity, and treatment history influence the observed relationships.

### Null and Negative Findings in Specific Populations

Several investigations have reported null associations or even protective effects of AD against diabetes, adding complexity to the interpretation of the epidemiological landscape. A large population-based study in Denmark examining loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG)—a major genetic determinant of AD susceptibility—initially reported an association between filaggrin null genotypes and increased self-reported diabetes in a general population sample, with adjustment for age and gender yielding statistical significance[14]. However, when this initial observation was tested in four independent Danish cohorts totaling 13,373 adults aged 15-77 years, with rigorous registry-based outcome ascertainment, no association was detected between FLG loss-of-function mutations and incident type 2 diabetes, stroke, ischemic heart disease, or all-cause mortality[17]. This discordance between initial cross-sectional findings and subsequent prospective cohort data suggests that the apparent association in cross-sectional analysis may have reflected reverse causality, with diabetes-related metabolic changes increasing AD reporting, rather than AD predisposing to diabetes.

In a more recent pediatric investigation from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), researchers examined associations between AD activity and severity with fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in late childhood and adolescence[51]. The study included 9,067 children with AD data at ages 9, 15, and/or 17 years and found no significant associations between AD and blood glucose at any time point, with no consistent trends by disease severity[51]. However, a significant positive association was observed between moderate to severe AD and insulin levels specifically at age 15, suggesting possible early insulin resistance in adolescents with severe AD[51]. This mixed pattern—lack of glucose dysregulation but possible early insulin resistance in severe AD—indicates that the AD-T2DM relationship may be age-dependent and operate through metabolic pathways that emerge gradually during the progression from insulin resistance to frank glucose intolerance.

## Shared Pathophysiological Mechanisms Linking Atopic Dermatitis and Type 2 Diabetes

### The Central Role of Type 2 Immune Dysregulation and Th2 Polarization

Despite the epidemiological contradictions, compelling mechanistic evidence supports a biological link between AD and T2DM through shared immune dysregulation, particularly abnormal T helper cell subset balance and enhanced type 2 cytokine production. Both AD and T2DM involve dysregulated immune responses characterized by elevation of type 2 cytokines including interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and interleukin-13 (IL-13), though these cytokines are activated through different antigenic stimuli and tissue contexts[11][45]. In AD, the early immune response is predominantly type 2 mediated, with multiple cell types including keratinocytes, Th2 cells, mast cells, and innate lymphoid cells producing thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-4, IL-13, IL-25, and IL-33[3][7]. These type 2 cytokines profoundly inhibit terminal keratinocyte differentiation and suppress epidermal lipid synthesis, thereby driving the epidermal barrier dysfunction that characterizes AD pathobiology[3]. Notably, type 2 cytokines have also been shown to suppress production of epidermal ceramides—critical structural lipids essential for skin barrier integrity—and to reduce the function of tight junctions, perpetuating barrier compromise[3].

Similarly, in T2DM, emerging evidence demonstrates enhanced type 2 immune responses that contribute to systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. T2DM patients express higher serum levels of IL-4 and IL-5 compared to metabolically healthy controls, consistent with a role for Th2-mediated inflammatory responses in diabetes pathogenesis[11]. Notably, IL-17, a signature cytokine of Th17 cells, has been shown to exacerbate the inflammatory state in T2DM, and IL-13 levels are significantly elevated in the serum of insulin-resistant patients[11]. This suggests that both AD and T2DM are characterized by abnormal Th2 and Th17 cell activation, albeit triggered by different initial insults—allergen exposure and barrier disruption in AD, and excess nutrient-driven metabolic inflammation in T2DM. The convergence on similar cytokine profiles provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding how genetic or environmental factors predisposing to one condition might increase susceptibility to the other.

### Systemic Low-Grade Inflammation as a Common Pathogenic Factor

Both AD and T2DM are characterized by systemic low-grade chronic inflammation, often termed meta-inflammation in the context of metabolic disease, which provides a unifying pathogenic mechanism linking skin inflammation to metabolic dysfunction. A landmark study demonstrating the association between elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and various skin diseases found that atopic eczema was particularly strongly associated with systemic inflammation, with adjusted odds ratios for highly elevated hs-CRP levels of 2.4-fold greater in subjects with atopic eczema compared to those without atopic eczema after adjustment for body mass index and systemic diseases[46]. This finding is noteworthy because elevated systemic hs-CRP is itself an independent risk marker for T2DM development and cardiovascular complications, raising the possibility that AD-associated systemic inflammation contributes to downstream metabolic dysfunction[43][46].

Mechanistically, the inflammatory mediators produced in AD lesions and systemically elevated during disease activity—including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-6, and IL-1β—are well-established contributors to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in T2DM[15][43]. A systematic meta-analysis of prospective studies examining associations of IL-6 and C-reactive protein with T2DM development found that elevated IL-6 levels were significantly associated with increased T2DM risk (pooled relative risk, 1.33; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.17-1.51), with comparable associations for CRP (pooled relative risk, 1.28; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.09-1.51)[43]. IL-6 may contribute to T2DM pathology through direct effects on insulin signaling pathways and pancreatic beta-cell function, as well as through indirect effects on hepatic glucose production and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity[43]. Given that AD patients demonstrate elevated circulating levels of these inflammatory mediators, the systemic inflammation associated with AD represents a plausible mechanism through which AD could increase T2DM risk.

### Skin Barrier Dysfunction and Systemic Immune Tolerance

The impaired epidermal barrier that characterizes AD extends beyond cutaneous manifestations and may contribute to systemic immune dysregulation predisposing to T2DM through alterations in immune tolerance and enhanced translocation of microbial-associated molecular patterns. AD is fundamentally characterized by defects in epidermal barrier function resulting from multiple mechanisms including filaggrin gene mutations (present in approximately 30 percent of AD patients), diminished or dysfunctional ceramides, and increased transepidermal water loss[3][24][27]. These barrier defects not only permit increased entry of allergens and microbial pathogens but also facilitate epithelial permeability that allows systemically significant amounts of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other bacterial products to cross the skin barrier[3][27].

Emerging literature suggests that barrier dysfunction itself may promote low-grade endotoxemia and systemic immune activation through enhanced translocation of commensal bacterial products, a mechanism first hypothesized in the context of allergic disease but increasingly recognized as relevant to metabolic dysfunction[1][4][14]. This "barrier dysfunction hypothesis" posits that impaired skin barrier function, by permitting enhanced penetration of microbial products and allergens, increases the propensity to develop low-grade systemic inflammation that in concert with other metabolic risk factors could increase diabetes susceptibility[1][14]. Support for this mechanism comes from observations that individuals with filaggrin null mutations—even in the absence of manifest AD—show increased systemic inflammatory markers and metabolic abnormalities in some studies[14]. Furthermore, the hygiene hypothesis suggests that reduced microbial exposure and aberrant immune development may predispose to both atopic and autoimmune diseases, providing an environmental framework in which both AD and metabolic inflammation could arise from shared early-life exposures and immune dysregulation[20][23].

## The Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunction Intersection

### Bidirectional Relationships Between Atopic Dermatitis and Obesity

A critical mechanistic link between AD and T2DM operates through obesity and metabolic dysfunction, creating a bidirectional interaction in which obesity predisposes to and/or worsens AD, while AD, in turn, increases the risk of obesity. Prospective epidemiological data demonstrate that among individuals with long-standing AD (duration >1 year), body mass index is significantly elevated compared to controls without AD, and the prevalence of obesity is substantially higher in patients with chronic AD compared to either newly diagnosed AD cases or individuals without AD[9][37]. This suggests that AD does not merely occur coincidentally in obese individuals but that chronic AD actively promotes weight gain and obesity development. Mechanistically, AD-associated systemic elevation of multiple proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1β increases production of fatty acids and triglycerides and stimulates adipocyte proliferation and hypertrophy[9][37].

Conversely, obesity and elevated adiposity actively promote AD development and exacerbate disease severity through multiple pathways involving dysregulated adipokine signaling and immune activation. Obesity-associated elevation of leptin, a pro-inflammatory adipokine, upregulates expression of AD-related cytokines and chemokines, thereby increasing AD risk[31][34]. Obesity also suppresses adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, leading to enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production by macrophages[31][34]. The net effect of obesity on the AD inflammatory milieu is enhanced Th2 and Th17 cytokine production and reduced regulatory T cell (Treg) function, creating conditions favorable for AD development or exacerbation[31][34][37]. Importantly, obese individuals with AD show enhanced resistance to conventional anti-inflammatory therapies, including cyclosporine, while weight loss has been documented to substantially improve AD outcomes, even in cases refractory to immunosuppressive treatment[9][37]. This evidence indicates that obesity and AD form a pathogenic partnership in which weight reduction offers therapeutic benefit for both conditions.

### Insulin Resistance, Adipokine Dysregulation, and Cutaneous Inflammation

The mechanistic intersection between obesity, insulin resistance, and AD involves dysregulated adipokine signaling and altered lipid metabolism that simultaneously predisposes to metabolic dysfunction and cutaneous inflammation. Central obesity increases pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration including TNF-α, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-31, while simultaneously decreasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines such as IL-10 and adiponectin[24]. This imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators contributes to immune system dysregulation and increases AD risk, while the same inflammatory milieu characterizes T2DM and promotes insulin resistance[24][31][34]. Leptin, whose circulating levels are markedly elevated in obesity, directly promotes Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation while suppressing Treg proliferation through activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, thereby shifting immune responses toward pro-inflammatory phenotypes that characterize both AD and T2DM[31][34].

The relationship between insulin resistance and AD severity has been demonstrated in multiple investigations. A recent cross-sectional study of 50 consecutively recruited adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD and 30 healthy controls found that patients with AD exhibited significantly higher insulin resistance, measured using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and a trend toward higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome compared to controls[32]. In multivariable regression analysis, AD was independently associated with insulin resistance after adjustment for age, sex, waist circumference, and current smoking, suggesting that the relationship between AD and metabolic dysfunction is not merely a consequence of confounding by obesity[32]. Furthermore, when examining metabolic syndrome components individually, patients with AD showed significantly higher triglyceride levels and larger waist circumference compared to controls[32]. These findings suggest that AD is associated with multiple metabolic abnormalities beyond simple obesity, including dyslipidemia and central fat distribution patterns characteristic of metabolic syndrome.

### Shared Lipid Metabolism Abnormalities

A particularly intriguing mechanistic connection between AD and T2DM involves alterations in epidermal and systemic lipid composition and metabolism. Evidence from investigation of a type 2 diabetes mellitus model (db/db mice) reveals extensive alterations in both skin and systemic lipid profiles, with disproportionate enrichment of short-chain ceramides in the epidermis compared to long-chain ceramides[33]. The proper ratio and distribution of ceramides across varying chain lengths is critical for epidermal barrier function, as short-chain lipids are important for membrane fluidity while long-chained ceramides provide high stacking capacity essential for robust lamella structure construction[33]. The pattern of lipid alterations in diabetic skin—characterized by relative abundance of shorter-chain ceramides with depletion of longer-chain ceramides—represents an abnormality distinct from that observed in AD, where asymmetric alteration of ceramides across chain lengths is observed with short-chain ceramide elevation but greater long-chain ceramide depletion[33].

These lipid abnormalities have functional consequences for skin barrier integrity and may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to cutaneous inflammation in diabetic individuals. While the lipid profile in T2DM differs somewhat from that in AD, both conditions involve dysregulation of ceramide and fatty acid homeostasis, suggesting shared underlying abnormalities in lipid synthesis or metabolism that could predispose to both metabolic dysfunction and skin barrier compromise. The transcriptomic profiling of AD skin has identified dysregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including genes encoding proteins essential to de novo ceramide synthesis and proteins involved in elongation of long-chain fatty acids[3]. In T2DM, the alteration of these same pathways could simultaneously compromise skin barrier function and exacerbate metabolic inflammation, providing a mechanistic link between the two conditions at the level of lipid biology.

## Treatment Effects, Medication-Induced Confounding, and Causality Assessment

### The Confounding Effect of Corticosteroid Therapy

A critical confounding variable that must be considered when evaluating the AD-T2DM association is the use of corticosteroids, which are widely employed for AD treatment but carry well-documented diabetogenic effects. Both topical and systemic corticosteroids have been associated with increased T2DM risk in multiple large-scale epidemiological studies, raising the possibility that the observed elevated T2DM risk in AD cohorts might partially reflect corticosteroid-induced metabolic dysfunction rather than the underlying AD pathology itself. A large registry study examining the association between topical corticosteroid use and T2DM risk included 115,218 individuals with incident T2DM in the Danish population and found that topical corticosteroid use was significantly associated with T2DM, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.25 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23-1.28) in the Danish case-control study and 1.27 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23-1.31) in the United Kingdom case-control study[55]. Additionally, individuals exposed to topical corticosteroids demonstrated significantly increased risk of incident T2DM in a cohort analysis, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.27 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.26-1.29)[55]. Notably, dose-response relationships were observed, with increasing potency of topical corticosteroids showing stronger associations with T2DM risk[55].

A more recent large population-based case-control study of 1,025,270 patients with AD examined the association between long-term oral corticosteroid use and adverse outcomes[35]. The study found that use of oral corticosteroids for more than 90 days during a one-year period was associated with a slightly increased risk of composite adverse outcomes, including T2DM, though there was no increased risk with use of oral corticosteroids for more than 30 days[35]. The results demonstrated a monotonic dose-duration relationship, with greater cumulative and consecutive years of oral corticosteroid use associated with elevated risk[35]. These findings underscore the importance of rigorous adjustment for corticosteroid intensity and duration in any epidemiological investigation of the AD-T2DM relationship, as failure to adequately account for corticosteroid exposure could lead to confounding-driven overestimation of disease-specific associations.

However, the AD-T2DM association reported in recent prospective cohort studies has generally persisted even after adjustment for corticosteroid use and other medications. The South Korean cohort study that documented a 44 percent increased T2DM risk in AD patients conducted sensitivity analyses that remained significant after adjustment for corticosteroid exposure[2][26]. Additionally, the Mendelian randomization analyses, which examine genetic associations and are by design free from confounding by medication use (assuming random distribution of medication prescriptions across genotypes), consistently found causal effects of AD on T2DM risk[11][45]. These findings suggest that while corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia likely contributes to some excess T2DM risk in AD patients, the association between AD and T2DM is not entirely explained by medication effects and reflects at least partially intrinsic pathogenic mechanisms linking the two conditions.

### The Impact of Antidiabetic Medications and Treatment Adherence

The treatment of T2DM itself may influence AD manifestations through pleiotropic effects of glucose-lowering agents on immune function and inflammation. While limited literature directly examines effects of specific antidiabetic medications on AD outcomes, some evidence suggests that metabolic improvement through effective diabetes control might ameliorate AD severity. In a study examining the longitudinal relationship between glycemic control and microbiota composition in T1D patients, insulin treatment led to normalization of dysbiotic microbiota patterns within two years[20]. Since gut dysbiosis has been implicated in AD pathogenesis through effects on intestinal permeability and systemic immune tolerance, improved glycemic control in T2DM patients might hypothetically reduce AD severity through restoration of beneficial commensal microbiota[20][44]. However, direct evidence for such effects in T2DM populations is lacking, and the predominant clinical experience suggests that T2DM medications, with the exception of corticosteroids, do not substantially ameliorate AD.

### Design Considerations and Temporality in Causal Assessment

The apparent contradiction between recent prospective cohort evidence showing increased T2DM risk in AD and older meta-analytic evidence showing reduced AD prevalence in diabetes deserves careful examination through the lens of causal inference methodology. The Hill criteria for causality include temporality (exposure must precede outcome), which is difficult to establish in cross-sectional studies but readily demonstrable in prospective cohort investigations[2][26]. The contemporary cohort studies showing AD→T2DM associations establish temporal precedence because participants were identified based on AD diagnosis and then followed forward for subsequent diabetes development[2][26]. Conversely, the meta-analysis showing lower AD prevalence in diabetes patients likely included cross-sectional studies in which the temporal sequence between AD and diabetes was not established, leaving open the possibility that the apparent protective effect reflects reverse causality in which chronic diabetes and metabolic changes reduce AD reporting or manifestation[1][19].

Additionally, disease duration represents a critical temporal consideration that differs between studies. The prospective cohort examinations generally focused on newly diagnosed AD patients, whereas the meta-analysis combined studies of prevalent diabetes patients, some with many years of disease duration[1][2][19]. Over the course of prolonged T2DM, substantial metabolic remodeling occurs, including progressive changes in adipokine levels, immune cell composition, and microbial dysbiosis, all of which might influence AD susceptibility differently than in the acute phase of diabetes development[1][24]. The absence of published evidence examining AD incidence specifically in newly diagnosed versus long-standing T2DM patients limits definitive conclusions, but temporal heterogeneity in disease duration represents a plausible explanation for divergent associations across studies.

## Genetic and Environmental Factors Contributing to Shared Susceptibility

### Filaggrin Gene Mutations as a Potential Shared Genetic Factor

The filaggrin gene (FLG), which encodes a major structural protein in the upper epidermis responsible for skin barrier maintenance, represents one potential shared genetic determinant contributing to both AD and T2DM susceptibility. Filaggrin mutations are present in approximately 8-10 percent of the general European population and are strongly associated with AD, ichthyosis vulgaris, and heightened risk of asthma and allergic rhinitis in combination with AD[14][17]. The initial observation that FLG loss-of-function mutations were more prevalent in individuals reporting diabetes led to the hypothesis that inherited impairment of skin barrier function increases propensity to low-grade systemic inflammation, which in concert with other factors could increase diabetes risk[14]. However, subsequent prospective studies in Danish populations failed to replicate this association, finding no relationship between FLG mutations and incident type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or all-cause mortality[17]. Notably, T2DM patients do carry an elevated incidence of filaggrin null mutations compared to controls in some but not all studies, and mechanistically, type 2 diabetes is associated with altered filaggrin expression and skin barrier dysfunction that could, through permitting enhanced microbial translocation, contribute to metabolic inflammation[11][45].

A recent multi-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 56,146 AD cases and 602,280 controls identified 101 genomic loci associated with AD, including 15 previously unreported loci[48]. Among the identified genes, several encode components of signaling pathways relevant to both inflammation and metabolic function, including IL-6 signaling pathway genes (IL6ST, IL6, IL6R, SOCS3), IL-22 pathway genes (IL22RA2), and genes involved in immune cell activation (ITK, BATF)[48]. The enrichment of AD GWAS signals in keratinocytes, particularly in differentiated keratinocytes associated with epidermal barrier function, highlights the importance of epithelial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis[48]. Whether these same genetic loci contribute to T2DM susceptibility remains an open question, though linkage disequilibrium and pleiotropy between AD and diabetes GWAS signals would provide genetic evidence for shared susceptibility loci.

### Environmental Factors, the Hygiene Hypothesis, and Microbiota Dysbiosis

Beyond genetic predisposition, environmental factors—particularly early-life microbial exposures and the development of appropriate immune tolerance—represent shared environmental determinants that may influence both AD and T2DM susceptibility. The hygiene hypothesis posits that reduced exposure to infectious agents, parasites, and commensal microorganisms in westernized societies impairs normal immune development, leading to enhanced Th2-skewed responses characteristic of atopic disease and simultaneously reducing the immune tolerance necessary to prevent autoimmune and metabolic dysfunction[20][23]. This framework explains how AD and T2DM, though often considered distinct diseases, could share common environmental origins in reduced early-life microbial exposure and dysbiotic microbiota composition.

Dysbiosis of both the gut and skin microbiota has been implicated in AD pathogenesis and, increasingly, in T2DM development[20][44][47]. In AD, dysbiosis is characterized by reduced overall microbial diversity, depletion of protective commensal species, and overgrowth of pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus, patterns that track with disease activity and severity[44]. This dysbiosis perpetuates a self-reinforcing cycle in which barrier dysfunction permits increased bacterial colonization, which triggers type 2 immune responses that further impair barrier function, and systemic exposure to microbial products drives low-grade inflammation[44]. In T2DM, dysbiosis is similarly characterized by reduced diversity and altered representation of beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria including Clostridium clusters, with corresponding elevation of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria whose lipopolysaccharides trigger metabolic endotoxemia[47].

The shared mechanistic role of dysbiosis in both conditions provides a potential environmental pathway through which early-life factors affecting microbiota composition could predispose to both AD and metabolic dysfunction. Several studies support this concept by demonstrating that dysbiosis precedes and contributes to AD development in prospective cohorts, and that dysbiotic microbiota profiles predict T2DM risk[20][44]. Furthermore, interventions targeting dysbiosis through probiotic administration, prebiotic supplementation, or fecal microbiota transplantation show promise in preliminary studies for ameliorating both conditions, though larger randomized controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy[20][44]. The gut-skin axis—a bidirectional signaling network linking intestinal microbiota composition and immune function to cutaneous inflammation—provides a mechanistic framework for understanding how systemic dysbiosis could simultaneously predispose to and perpetuate both AD and metabolic dysfunction.

### Stress, the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis, and Neuroimmune Pathways

Chronic psychological stress represents an environmental factor with documented relevance to both AD and T2DM pathogenesis through effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stress-responsive immune mechanisms. Stress-related activation of the HPA axis increases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and cortisol signaling, and CRH receptors on mast cells and keratinocytes promote release of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-6, and pruritogenic substances that exacerbate AD[44]. Simultaneously, stress-related HPA activation impairs glucose tolerance, increases insulin resistance, and promotes T2DM development through both central effects on glucose homeostasis and peripheral effects on adipose tissue inflammation[15][44]. These pathways provide a mechanism through which chronic stress could contribute to both conditions through activation of shared neuroimmune circuitry.

Additionally, stress-related pathways have been linked to increased intestinal permeability, potentially facilitating systemic exposure to microbial products and exacerbating the metabolic endotoxemia that characterizes T2DM[44]. The neuro-immuno-cutaneous network linking the central nervous system, immune system, and skin through shared innervation and signaling molecules provides an anatomical and functional basis for understanding how HPA axis dysregulation could simultaneously predispose to cutaneous and metabolic inflammation[44]. While direct evidence for stress-mediated bidirectional effects on both AD and T2DM in the same individuals is limited, the convergence of evidence for stress effects on each condition separately suggests that stress represents a shared environmental risk factor with potential relevance to the AD-T2DM comorbidity.

## Clinical Implications and Recommendations for Integrated Management

### Screening and Risk Stratification Considerations

Given the documented elevated risk of T2DM in AD patients, current clinical practice should incorporate routine assessment of diabetes risk in adult AD populations, particularly those with moderate-to-severe disease, elevated body mass index, or additional metabolic risk factors. The approximate 44 percent increased risk of T2DM in AD patients is comparable in magnitude to well-established metabolic risk factors such as impaired fasting glucose, family history of diabetes, and sedentary lifestyle, suggesting that AD status warrants consideration in diabetes risk calculators and screening algorithms. The consistency of this association across prospective cohorts, multiple geographic regions, and diverse populations indicates that screening recommendations should apply broadly rather than being restricted to specific subpopulations. Early identification of insulin resistance through measurement of fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or HOMA-IR in AD patients could enable preventive interventions before overt T2DM development, potentially averting progression to manifest disease.

Conversely, individuals newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should receive dermatological evaluation or education regarding recognition of AD symptoms, particularly given the emerging evidence that some studies have shown elevated AD risk in newly diagnosed diabetes cohorts, though this association appears less consistent than the reverse direction. The bidirectional relationship between obesity and AD, combined with the well-established T2DM-obesity association, suggests that comprehensive metabolic and dermatological assessment should be integrated in clinical evaluation of both conditions. Weight loss interventions, while primarily targeting T2DM prevention and management, should be emphasized given the documented efficacy of weight reduction in ameliorating both AD and metabolic dysfunction.

### Antidiabetic Medication Selection and Corticosteroid Stewardship

The confounding effect of corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia underscores the importance of judicious corticosteroid use in AD management and the deployment of corticosteroid-sparing therapies where feasible. Systemic corticosteroid use for more than 90 days annually was associated with increased adverse outcomes in large cohort studies, with monotonic dose-duration relationships indicating that even modest corticosteroid exposure carries risk[35]. The advent of corticosteroid-sparing biologic therapies, including monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-4 receptor alpha (dupilumab), IL-23 (risankizumab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab), and other inflammatory pathways, offers opportunities to treat moderate-to-severe AD without the diabetogenic effects of systemic corticosteroids[3][7]. For AD patients with established T2DM or at high risk for diabetes development, prioritization of corticosteroid-sparing approaches to AD treatment should be strongly considered, even if biologic therapies carry higher costs or require more intensive monitoring than conventional treatments.

The selection of antidiabetic medications for AD patients with T2DM might preferentially favor agents with pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects, though evidence for differential effects of specific antidiabetic drug classes on AD outcomes remains limited. Insulin and sulfonylureas, which directly augment insulin levels, might theoretically exacerbate AD through effects on the IL-2/JAK-STAT pathway that promotes Th1 and Th17 differentiation[34], though clinical evidence is lacking. Conversely, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonists, beyond their glucose-lowering effects, exert anti-inflammatory actions that might hypothetically benefit AD[31]. However, the lack of definitive evidence regarding medication class effects on AD in diabetic patients suggests that antidiabetic drug selection should continue to be guided by standard T2DM management principles rather than hypothetical AD-related considerations pending accumulation of further evidence.

### Integrated Lifestyle Interventions Addressing Shared Risk Factors

Weight loss and increased physical activity represent cornerstone interventions with documented benefits for both AD and T2DM that should be emphasized in comprehensive management plans. The bidirectional relationship between obesity and AD, combined with well-established obesity-T2DM associations, creates a powerful rationale for intensive lifestyle intervention targeting weight reduction in patients with both conditions. A meta-analysis examining weight loss effects on AD outcomes found that weight reduction substantially improves AD outcomes in obese individuals, with some studies documenting improvement even in cases resistant to systemic immunosuppressive therapy[9]. The magnitude of benefit observed—with improvements in Eczema Area and Severity Index scores and reductions in required cyclosporine dosing—suggests that weight loss should be promoted as a primary rather than adjunctive AD intervention in overweight and obese patients.

Dietary interventions and probiotics represent emerging approaches with potential relevance to both AD and T2DM through effects on gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation. While evidence from large randomized controlled trials is limited, preliminary data suggest that specific dietary patterns (Mediterranean diet, low glycemic index diet, polyphenol-rich diets) and targeted probiotic supplementation may ameliorate both cutaneous inflammation in AD and glycemic control in T2DM through restoration of beneficial microbiota and reduction of dysbiosis-associated metabolic endotoxemia[15][44][47]. The synergistic potential of combined lifestyle interventions addressing weight, diet, physical activity, and stress—the latter through mindfulness and other behavioral approaches—suggests that comprehensive behavioral programs targeting shared risk factors might offer superior outcomes compared to isolated intervention on single factors.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

The relationship between atopic dermatitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus exemplifies the complexity of chronic inflammatory comorbidities and highlights the necessity for integrated, multidisciplinary approaches to patient care that recognize the bidirectional and multifactorial nature of disease associations. Contemporary prospective cohort studies and Mendelian randomization analyses provide compelling evidence that atopic dermatitis contributes causally to increased type 2 diabetes risk, with newly diagnosed AD patients experiencing approximately 44 percent elevated risk of subsequent T2DM development. This association persists across diverse populations, age groups, and obesity categories, suggesting that AD warrants clinical recognition as an independent metabolic risk factor. The mechanistic pathways linking AD to T2DM involve multiple overlapping biological processes including systemic chronic inflammation, shared type 2 immune dysregulation, skin barrier dysfunction promoting transepidermal microbial translocation, bidirectional interactions with obesity and adipokine dysregulation, and potentially shared genetic architecture affecting inflammatory and barrier function genes.

Nevertheless, the historical meta-analytic evidence suggesting that AD is protective against diabetes, combined with the apparent inconsistency in associations across different study designs and populations, emphasizes the importance of continued research to clarify the precise nature of the AD-T2DM relationship, including potential effect modification by disease chronicity, treatment patterns, and demographic factors. Future investigations should employ prospective cohort designs with rigorous temporal definition of disease onset, comprehensive assessment of disease severity and activity, detailed medication exposure tracking including corticosteroid intensity and duration, and measurement of mechanistic biomarkers including inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, measures of barrier function, and microbiota composition. Examination of the AD-T2DM association across diverse ancestry groups is essential given that current evidence is predominantly derived from European populations, and genetic and environmental influences on both conditions likely vary substantially across ancestries.

The clinical implications of the established AD-T2DM association extend beyond disease-specific treatment to encompass integrated screening strategies, preferential deployment of corticosteroid-sparing therapies in AD management, comprehensive lifestyle interventions targeting shared risk factors including weight loss and dietary modification, and consideration of antidiabetic medication selection in AD patients with established T2DM. The shared mechanistic pathways linking AD and T2DM—particularly dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and obesity—create opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions targeting these common denominators rather than solely addressing disease-specific manifestations. As the understanding of the gut-skin axis and neuroimmune pathways advances, integrative approaches addressing stress reduction, microbiota restoration through probiotics and dietary modification, and comprehensive metabolic optimization may offer superior outcomes compared to isolated disease-specific treatment. Further research elucidating the genetic and environmental contributors to AD-T2DM comorbidity, the role of medication-induced confounding, and the potential for shared interventions to ameliorate both conditions simultaneously will strengthen the evidence base for integrated clinical care of patients with this increasingly recognized disease pairing.
