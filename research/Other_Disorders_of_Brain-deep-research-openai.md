## Pathophysiology of “Other Disorders of Brain”

**Overview:** The category *“Other disorders of brain”* encompasses a heterogeneous group of neurological conditions (ICD-10 G93) that do not fall under more specific diagnoses ([gesund.bund.de](https://gesund.bund.de/en/icd-code-search/g93#:~:text=,Other%20specified%20disorders%20of%20brain)). This includes diverse pathologies such as anoxic/hypoxic brain injury, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), chronic fatigue syndrome (myalgic encephalomyelitis), Reye syndrome, cerebral edema, and others ([gesund.bund.de](https://gesund.bund.de/en/icd-code-search/g93#:~:text=,Other%20specified%20disorders%20of%20brain)). Because of this diversity, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms vary widely. However, common themes involve disruptions in neuronal homeostasis, metabolism, and intracranial environment that ultimately lead to impaired brain function. Below, the core pathophysiological mechanisms are outlined, followed by key molecular players, impacted biological processes, cellular components, disease progression, and phenotypic manifestations, with supporting evidence from recent research and authoritative sources.

### 1. Core Pathophysiology

**Anoxic/Hypoxic Brain Injury:** A major mechanism in many acute brain insults is **excitotoxicity** – excessive glutamate release and overactivation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-overload and neuronal death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20an%20important%20role,As%20researchers%20work)). Energy deprivation (from **hypoxia/ischemia**) causes ATP loss, failure of ion pumps, and sustained neuronal depolarization, triggering massive glutamate release. This initiates a cascade of cell injury: **calcium influx** activates degradative enzymes and nitric oxide synthase, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20an%20important%20role,As%20researchers%20work)). High extracellular glutamate also impairs cystine uptake into cells, depleting glutathione and precipitating **ferroptosis** – an iron-dependent lipid peroxidation cell death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20an%20important%20role,As%20researchers%20work)). In ischemic brain tissue, multiple intertwined processes – *“inflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, calcium overload, apoptosis, and disruption of the blood–brain barrier”* – together drive neuronal injury ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=reducing%20overall%20efficacy%20,2022)). Within hours of an anoxic insult, affected neurons undergo necrosis or apoptosis; dying cells release damage signals that activate resident microglia and astrocytes, leading to neuroinflammation. Edema (both cytotoxic cell swelling and vasogenic edema from leaky capillaries) develops, raising intracranial pressure and compounding the damage ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=reducing%20overall%20efficacy%20,2022)). Certain brain regions (e.g. hippocampal CA1 neurons and cortical layers) are especially vulnerable to hypoxia. A *2024 review* highlights that *“neurons are particularly sensitive to cerebral hypoxia, with their apical dendrites being vulnerable to damage, thereby affecting cognitive function”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303443/#:~:text=AMPA%20receptors%2C%20NMDA%20receptors%2C%20and,studies%20not%20only%20contribute%20to)). Dendritic spine loss and synaptic dysfunction occur under hypoxic stress, impairing neurotransmission and memory circuits ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303443/#:~:text=hypoxia%20can%20significantly%20alter%20the,hypoxia%2C%20with%20their%20apical%20dendrites)). Astrocytes and microglia play dual roles – initially buffering glutamate and protecting neurons, but later producing cytokines and forming glial scars during the repair phase ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303443/#:~:text=AMPA%20receptors%2C%20NMDA%20receptors%2C%20and,studies%20not%20only%20contribute%20to)).

**Metabolic Encephalopathies (Reye Syndrome):** Reye syndrome is an acute metabolic encephalopathy classically occurring in children after a viral illness with aspirin use. The core pathology is **mitochondrial failure** in the liver and brain ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=The%20pathogenesis%20of%20Reye%20syndrome%2C,may%20be%20a%20potential%20pathophysiologic)) ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,ICP)). A viral infection primes the host, and exposure to salicylates (aspirin) acts as a mitochondrial toxin in susceptible individuals ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=host%20potentially%20with%20an%20underlying,%5B8%5D)). This combination causes diffuse **mitochondrial injury**, disrupting oxidative phosphorylation and **fatty acid β-oxidation** in hepatocytes and possibly in brain cells ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=The%20pathogenesis%20of%20Reye%20syndrome%2C,may%20be%20a%20potential%20pathophysiologic)). As a result, the liver accumulates fat (microvesicular steatosis) and fails to detoxify ammonia. Ammonia and other toxic metabolites rise in the bloodstream, leading to **hyperammonemia**. Elevated ammonia readily crosses the blood–brain barrier and is taken up by astrocytes, where it is converted to glutamine. The excess glutamine and ammonia cause astrocytes to swell (cytotoxic edema). Consequently, intracranial pressure elevates and diffuse brain edema ensues ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,ICP)). In Reye syndrome, histopathology shows *“astrocyte edema and loss of neurons in the brain… All cells have pleomorphic, swollen mitochondria… Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction results in hyperammonemia, which is thought to induce astrocyte edema, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure”* ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,ICP)). Clinically, this corresponds to rapidly progressive encephalopathy (vomiting, confusion, seizures, coma). Notably, Reye syndrome overlaps with inborn metabolic errors: for example, **medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD)** deficiency (ACADM gene) can present with a Reye-like picture ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Inborn%20errors%20of%20metabolism)). The implication is that blockade of fatty-acid oxidation – whether by genetic defect or toxin – underlies the energy crisis and acute brain dysfunction. Minimal inflammation is seen in Reye’s encephalopathy (it is a *non-inflammatory* encephalopathy), distinguishing it from infectious encephalitis.

**Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):** IIH (also called pseudotumor cerebri) is a disorder of elevated intracranial pressure of unclear origin. Recent insights indicate IIH is fundamentally a disorder of **dysregulated CSF dynamics** on a background of systemic metabolic disturbance ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11910-025-01420-y#:~:text=9%20,CSF%29%20dynamics)). Over 95% of IIH patients are obese women of childbearing age ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=permanent%20visual%20loss%20and%20life,associated%20with%20changes%20in%20intracranial)), and it is now considered *“a probable metabolic disease involving a range of systemic manifestations”* rather than a purely idiopathic brain condition ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=permanent%20visual%20loss%20and%20life,associated%20with%20changes%20in%20intracranial)). Obesity-related factors – insulin resistance, adipokines (e.g. leptin resistance), and chronic low-grade inflammation – are thought to alter cerebrospinal fluid production or absorption ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11910-025-01420-y#:~:text=9%20,CSF%29%20dynamics)) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11910-025-01420-y#:~:text=Proposed%20pathophysiology%20of%20IIH,morbidities%20including%20polycystic)). Specifically, central adiposity and hormonal disturbances (such as polycystic ovary syndrome in many IIH patients) may increase intracranial venous pressure or impair venous drainage from the brain, thereby reducing CSF reabsorption ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11910-025-01420-y#:~:text=that%20live%20with%20IIH%20but,signs%20and%20symptoms%20of%20IIH)). There is often narrowing of the transverse dural venous sinuses in IIH, which can create a pressure gradient that hinders CSF outflow. The choroid plexus, which produces CSF, might also be overstimulated by endocrine factors. The net result is **chronically elevated intracranial pressure** in the absence of a mass lesion. Patients develop headaches and papilledema (optic disc swelling from raised pressure), with risk of optic nerve damage. A *2023 review* redefined IIH beyond the neuro-ophthalmologic features, noting: previously, it was characterized by *“raised intracranial pressure, headache and papilloedema…with risk of severe and permanent visual loss,”* but new evidence ties IIH to systemic metabolic dysfunction (virtually all patients have obesity, often with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors) ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=The%20understanding%20of%20idiopathic%20intracranial,Contemporary%20insights%20identify)) ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=permanent%20visual%20loss%20and%20life,associated%20with%20changes%20in%20intracranial)). The metabolic milieu likely *“contribute[s] to dysregulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics”*, leading to the symptoms of IIH ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11910-025-01420-y#:~:text=9%20,CSF%29%20dynamics)). Thus, while the proximate cause of symptoms is high CSF pressure compressing the brain and optic nerves, the root cause involves endocrine and adipose-related pathways that remain under investigation.

**Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS):** Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is a complex chronic disorder that, although systemic, involves significant dysfunction of the brain and central nervous system. The pathophysiology of ME/CFS is multifaceted, with **neuroimmune, metabolic, and possibly autoimmune mechanisms** at play ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=The%20exact%20cause%20of%20CFS%2FME,3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20may%20also%20have%20autoimmune,barrier%20allows%20harmful%20substances%2C%20such)). There is no single gene or pathway identified; instead, patients show a constellation of abnormalities. Many cases are triggered by an infection (often viral such as Epstein–Barr virus), after which a **dysregulated immune response** persists ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=suggesting%20an%20association%20with%20inflammation,49)). Patients exhibit evidence of chronic immune activation: for example, altered CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and NK cell function, reduced T-regulatory cells, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=Dysfunctional%20immune%20mechanisms%2C%20including%20altered,reduced%20T%20regulatory%20cell%20activity)). Persistent latent viruses (like EBV residing in B cells) may drive an ongoing immune response that fails to fully resolve ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=suggesting%20an%20association%20with%20inflammation,in%20the%20development%20of%20CFS%2FME)). A 2017 review described an overarching *“neuroinflammatory etiopathology”* in ME/CFS, pointing to activated microglia and astroglia in the brain producing cytokines that lead to central fatigue and cognitive symptoms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5314655/#:~:text=The%20Neuroinflammatory%20Etiopathology%20of%20Myalgic,and%20License%20information%20PMCID%3A%20PMC5314655)). Indeed, PET imaging studies have shown glial activation in certain brain regions of CFS patients, supporting a neuroinflammatory state. Another hypothesis emphasized **neuroglial dysfunction**: a 2022 review proposed that a *“common denominator of the pathobiological processes in ME/CFS may be CNS dysfunction due to impaired or pathologically reactive neuroglia (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes)”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9124899/#:~:text=these%20pathways%20may%20be%20related,key%20features%20%E2%80%93%20post%20exertional)). Alongside immune abnormalities, there is clear **metabolic and mitochondrial dysregulation**. Muscle biopsies and metabolomic studies in CFS patients show reduced oxidative metabolism and reliance on less efficient energy pathways. Patients have elevated resting lactate and evidence of oxidative stress. As one recent summary noted, *“studies have found higher lactate levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative stress markers in CFS/ME patients… abnormalities in glycolysis and amino acid metabolism, leading to inefficient energy production and post-exertional malaise”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20is%20also%20associated%20with,oxidative%20stress%20and%20mitochondrial%20dysfunction)). These findings suggest that the profound fatigue stems from an inability of cells (possibly muscle and brain cells) to meet energy demands, perhaps due to mitochondrial dysfunction or impaired metabolic switching. Another dimension is the **gut-brain axis**: chronic fatigue patients frequently exhibit **gut microbiome dysbiosis** and increased intestinal permeability (“leaky gut”), which can drive systemic inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20may%20also%20have%20autoimmune,barrier%20allows%20harmful%20substances%2C%20such)). A 2024 review states the *“gut plays a significant role in CFS/ME pathophysiology through mechanisms involving gut microbiome dysbiosis, increased gut permeability, immune modulation, disrupted energy metabolism, and the gut-brain axis”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20may%20also%20have%20autoimmune,barrier%20allows%20harmful%20substances%2C%20such)). For instance, lower levels of beneficial genera (like *Bifidobacterium* and *Lactobacillus*) and overgrowth of pro-inflammatory microbes have been documented ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=microbiome%20dysbiosis%2C%20increased%20gut%20permeability%2C,like%20symptoms)). This imbalance can allow lipopolysaccharide and other endotoxins into circulation, provoking chronic inflammation and potentially autoimmune-like phenomena ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=exhibit%20gut%20dysbiosis%2C%20characterized%20by,such%20as%20butyrate%2C%20which%20are)). Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria (e.g. butyrate) are reduced in some CFS patients, which may worsen gut barrier integrity and also deprive mitochondria of optimal substrates, feeding into the fatigue loop ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=impaired%20regulatory%20T,Given%20these%20connections)). In summary, ME/CFS pathophysiology is an interplay of immune activation (with possible autoantibodies, as some studies found β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor autoantibodies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1094%20,doi))), **neuroinflammation**, and energy metabolism impairments. This leads to a state of chronic oxidative stress and impaired neuronal function, underpinning the hallmark symptoms of fatigue, cognitive “brain fog,” unrestful sleep, and orthostatic intolerance. Research is actively evolving, especially with comparisons to post-acute COVID-19 syndromes that share features with ME/CFS, and new metabolomic and neuroimaging studies in 2023–2024 continue to refine our understanding.

### 2. Key Molecular Players

**Genes/Proteins:** Given the breadth of conditions in this category, a wide array of genes and proteins are involved in their pathogenesis:
- In excitotoxic brain injury, glutamate receptor subunits (e.g. **NMDA receptor** NR1 subunit, *GRIN1* gene) and voltage-gated calcium channels are pivotal in mediating calcium influx and neuronal death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20an%20important%20role,As%20researchers%20work)). Downstream, pro-apoptotic proteins like **BAX** and executioner caspases (e.g. **CASP3**) become activated, while stress-response factors such as **HIF1A** (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α) are upregulated under low oxygen.
- In Reye syndrome and related metabolic encephalopathies, mitochondrial enzymes are key. Dysfunction in **fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes** (such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, *ACADM*) or urea cycle enzymes (e.g. *CPS1*) can precipitate the disease ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=The%20pathogenesis%20of%20Reye%20syndrome%2C,may%20be%20a%20potential%20pathophysiologic)) ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Inborn%20errors%20of%20metabolism)). The mitochondrial matrix enzyme **CPT1A** (carnitine palmitoyltransferase I) is another example – it regulates entry of fatty acids into mitochondria; any impairment here can cause toxic lipid accumulation. **GLUL** (glutamine synthetase) in astrocytes converts ammonia to glutamine; overactivity of this pathway in hyperammonemic states leads to astrocytic swelling. Another protein, **GFAP** (glial fibrillary acidic protein), although not causative, is a marker of astrocyte activation and is often elevated during gliosis in these conditions.
- In IIH, no single gene mutation is known to cause the idiopathic form, but research points to **hormonal and adipokine signaling proteins**. **Leptin (LEP)** and its receptor (LEPR) are of interest because IIH patients often exhibit leptin resistance ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11910-025-01420-y#:~:text=Proposed%20pathophysiology%20of%20IIH,morbidities%20including%20polycystic)). High leptin levels (from adipose tissue) might affect hypothalamic pathways and also choroid plexus function (which expresses leptin receptors). **Aquaporin-4 (AQP4)**, a water channel on astrocyte end-feet, is involved in brain fluid homeostasis; it could play a role in the development of papilledema and edema. Additionally, **VEGF** (vascular endothelial growth factor) can be upregulated by hypoxia or metabolic dysregulation and may increase blood–brain barrier permeability, compounding intracranial pressure issues.
- In ME/CFS, studies have identified various immune and metabolic regulators. **Cytokines** such as **IL-1β**, **IL-6**, **TNF-α** (genes *IL1B*, *IL6*, *TNF*) are often reported to be elevated or dysregulated, indicating chronic inflammatory signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=regulatory%20cells%2C%20and%20NK%20cell,32)). Lower activity of **NK cell receptors** and exhaustion markers on T-lymphocytes suggest involvement of immune checkpoint genes. On the metabolic side, enzymes involved in **aerobic respiration** (e.g. **pyruvate dehydrogenase complex**) may be functionally downregulated – one study found evidence of impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase function in CFS, reducing ATP output. Elevated **HIF1A** in some CFS patients suggests pseudo-hypoxic metabolic reprogramming. Finally, potential **autoantigens** have been investigated: as noted, autoantibodies against β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (gene *ADRB2*) and M<sub>3</sub>/M<sub>4</sub> acetylcholine receptors have been found in subsets of patients, implicating these receptors in symptomatology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1094%20,doi)).

**Chemical Entities (Metabolites/Drugs):**  
- **Glutamate (CHEBI:30013)** – the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, central to excitotoxic injury. Excess extracellular glutamate triggers neuronal death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20an%20important%20role,As%20researchers%20work)). Drugs modulating glutamate (e.g. NMDA antagonists like ketamine or memantine) have been studied as neuroprotectants in acute brain injury.  
- **Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)** – not a drug but an ionic messenger; intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload is a final common pathway for cell injury in stroke, trauma, and status epilepticus. Downstream effects include activating calcium-dependent proteases and phospholipases that damage cell structures ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20an%20important%20role,As%20researchers%20work)).  
- **Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)** – highly reactive molecules like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (CHEBI:26523). Overproduction of ROS occurs during reperfusion after ischemia and in mitochondrial disorders, leading to oxidative damage of lipids, proteins, and DNA ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=specifically%20NMDAR%2C%20while%20in%20the,As%20researchers%20work)). Antioxidants (e.g. N-acetylcysteine, which boosts glutathione) have been explored to mitigate this in various brain injuries.  
- **Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin, CHEBI:15365)** – implicated in Reye syndrome. Aspirin’s metabolites (salicylates) interfere with mitochondrial electron transport and β-oxidation ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=host%20potentially%20with%20an%20underlying,%5B8%5D)). This is why aspirin use in viral fevers of children is contraindicated.  
- **Ammonia (NH₃/NH₄⁺, CHEBI:16134)** – a neurotoxic metabolite that accumulates in hepatic failure (including Reye’s). Ammonia crosses into the brain and drives astrocyte swelling by being converted to glutamine; it also perturbs neurotransmission by depleting α-ketoglutarate in neurons. Treatments like lactulose or sodium benzoate aim to reduce ammonia levels in related encephalopathies.  
- **Lactate (CHEBI:24996)** – a product of anaerobic metabolism, often elevated in hypoxic conditions and in disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. High brain lactate can contribute to acidosis and neuronal dysfunction. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in encephalopathy patients often detects elevated lactate as a biomarker of metabolic failure.  
- **Butyrate and Short-Chain Fatty Acids** – in CFS, reduced levels of SCFAs (like butyrate, CHEBI:17151) are noted due to gut dysbiosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=impaired%20regulatory%20T,Given%20these%20connections)). Butyrate is normally neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory (it supports regulatory T-cells and integrity of the gut barrier); its deficiency may worsen systemic inflammation and energy metabolism in CFS.  
- **Cortisol** – chronic stress and HPA axis dysregulation in CFS can alter cortisol levels. Some CFS patients show blunted diurnal cortisol, which might exacerbate immune activation (since cortisol is immunomodulatory).  
- **Drugs**: Various therapeutic agents target these pathways. For example, **Acetazolamide** (a diuretic, CHEBI:27690) is used in IIH to reduce CSF production by inhibiting choroid plexus carbonic anhydrase. **Corticosteroids** (e.g. dexamethasone) are sometimes used to reduce vasogenic edema by stabilizing the blood–brain barrier (as in brain tumor or high-altitude cerebral edema). In CFS, no specific drug is universally effective, but trials with **rituximab** (a B-cell depleting antibody) have been done, based on an autoimmune hypothesis.

**Cell Types:**  
- **Neurons (CL:0000540)** – the primary functional cells of the brain that bear the brunt of injury. In hypoxic-ischemic conditions, pyramidal neurons in the cortex and hippocampus are highly susceptible to excitotoxic death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303443/#:~:text=AMPA%20receptors%2C%20NMDA%20receptors%2C%20and,studies%20not%20only%20contribute%20to)). In CFS, while no gross neuron loss is evident, functional impairment of neural circuits is likely, possibly involving brainstem autonomic neurons (linked to orthostatic intolerance) and frontal lobe networks (linked to “brain fog”).  
- **Astrocytes (CL:0000127)** – star-shaped glial cells critical for neurotransmitter recycling, BBB maintenance, and metabolic support. Astrocytes take up excess glutamate via EAAT2 (SLC1A2 gene) to protect neurons; however, during severe insults they can become dysfunctional or swollen. Astrocytic swelling is central in hepatic encephalopathies (including Reye’s) due to ammonia toxicity ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=degeneration%20of%20the%20proximal%20lobules,ICP)). Astrocytes also help regulate intracranial pressure via water channels (AQP4) and the glymphatic system; their dysfunction may contribute to IIH and cerebral edema.  
- **Microglia (CL:0000129)** – the resident immune cells of the CNS. They are normally quiescent, surveying the environment, but activate in response to injury or infection. Activated microglia release cytokines (IL-1, TNF, etc.) and reactive oxygen species, contributing to neuroinflammation. In CFS, chronic microglial activation is suspected to maintain a neuroinflammatory state ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9124899/#:~:text=Several%20potential%20disease%20mechanisms%20have,We%20will%20test%20this)). After acute brain injury, microglia also phagocytose debris and can have dual roles – both damaging (if overactivated) and reparative.  
- **Oligodendrocytes (CL:0000128)** – myelin-producing glia in CNS. They can be affected secondarily in any diffuse brain disorder if there is demyelination or white-matter damage. While not a primary target in the listed conditions, any prolonged metabolic or inflammatory stress can impair oligodendrocyte function and myelin integrity, potentially slowing nerve conduction and contributing to cognitive or motor slowing.  
- **Endothelial cells (of BBB)** – form the lining of cerebral blood vessels with tight junctions that constitute the blood–brain barrier. In states of severe inflammation or hypoxia, endothelial cells can express adhesion molecules, allowing leukocyte entry, and can secrete vascular-permeability factors. BBB endothelial damage is a factor in vasogenic edema. In IIH, the endothelium of the dural venous sinuses may be exposed to high pressure and possibly undergo remodeling or thrombosis (in secondary intracranial hypertension).  
- **Choroid plexus epithelial cells** – specialized ependymal cells in brain ventricles that produce CSF. They express transporters and enzymes (like carbonic anhydrase) to secrete CSF. In IIH, these cells are effectively too active (or not sufficiently counterbalanced by absorption), so they are a therapeutic target (e.g., acetazolamide reduces their activity).  
- **Peripheral immune cells** – not brain cells per se, but in CFS and related conditions, peripheral T cells, B cells, and monocytes show altered activation profiles ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=Dysfunctional%20immune%20mechanisms%2C%20including%20altered,reduced%20T%20regulatory%20cell%20activity)). These can affect the brain via cytokines or by crossing a leaky BBB. For example, elevated Th17 cells (pro-inflammatory) or autoantibody-producing B cells could contribute to sustained neuroinflammation in CFS.

**Anatomical Locations:**  
- **Brain (UBERON:0000955)** – broadly, the entire brain is the focus, but certain regions are particularly involved. In global hypoxic injury, the **cerebral cortex (UBERON:0000956)** and **hippocampus (UBERON:0002421)** often suffer the most damage, leading to cognitive and memory deficits. The **basal ganglia (UBERON:0002435)** can be injured in anoxic encephalopathy as well (e.g., kernicterus or carbon monoxide poisoning tend to hit globus pallidus).  
- **Optic nerve (UBERON:0001608)** – in IIH, raised CSF pressure around the optic nerve causes papilledema. The pressure is transmitted along the subarachnoid space surrounding the optic nerves, compressing axonal transport. Chronic papilledema can lead to optic atrophy and permanent vision loss ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=The%20understanding%20of%20idiopathic%20intracranial,Contemporary%20insights%20identify)).  
- **Meninges and Ventricular System** – these are key in intracranial pressure disorders. The **subarachnoid space (UBERON:0002266)** where CSF flows and is absorbed via arachnoid granulations is central to IIH pathology (impaired absorption here can raise pressure). The **ventricles (UBERON:0000020)**, especially the lateral ventricles containing the choroid plexus, are the sites of CSF production; enlargement of ventricles (hydrocephalus) is related but in IIH the ventricles are usually normal-sized or small due to uniformly raised pressure.  
- **Liver (UBERON:0002107)** – though not part of the brain, the liver is critically involved in Reye syndrome. Liver failure leads to toxin accumulation affecting the brain (i.e., a **hepato-cerebral** axis of pathology). Fatty degeneration of the liver (microvesicular steatosis) is a hallmark in Reye’s ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,number%2C%20along%20with%20glycogen%20depletion)), and the inability to perform gluconeogenesis can cause hypoglycemia which further harms the brain. Thus, Reye’s pathophysiology spans both liver and brain.  
- **Blood–Brain Barrier** – an interface rather than a discrete location, formed by brain capillary endothelium (UBERON:0000010 for capillary, though the BBB is a functional composite). It is relevant in any condition where peripheral factors impact the brain. For instance, in sepsis-associated encephalopathy or possibly CFS, a leaky BBB permits peripheral cytokines or autoantibodies to infiltrate and affect neural tissue.  
- **White Matter Tracts** – diffuse cerebral insults like prolonged anoxia or edema can damage white matter. In chronic fatigue syndrome, MRI studies have shown subtle white matter changes or reduced connectivity in frontal regions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=MRI%20scans%20have%20revealed%20structural,related%20to%20executive%20functions%2C%20cognition)), which might correlate with cognitive symptoms.  
- **Hypothalamus (UBERON:0001898)** – the hypothalamus could be involved in IIH (given the obesity and endocrinological ties) and in CFS (HPA axis dysregulation). For example, some IIH patients have polycystic ovary syndrome and hyperandrogenism, suggesting hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis involvement; CFS patients often have sleep disturbances and autonomic dysfunction hinting at hypothalamic dysfunction.

### 3. Disrupted Biological Processes (GO Terms)

The diverse conditions grouped under “other disorders of brain” perturb many fundamental biological processes:

- **Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission** – excessive stimulation of glutamate signaling pathways (GO:0007268) is a hallmark of excitotoxic neuronal injury ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20an%20important%20role,As%20researchers%20work)). The normal process of neurotransmitter release and uptake is overwhelmed, leading to receptor-mediated toxicity.
- **Calcium Homeostasis** – processes regulating intracellular calcium (GO:0055074) are dysregulated during brain ischemia and injury. Loss of calcium equilibrium triggers downstream cell death cascades ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20an%20important%20role,As%20researchers%20work)).
- **Oxidative Phosphorylation** – the mitochondrial ATP-generating process (GO:0006119) is impaired in Reye’s syndrome and in the post-exertional malaise of CFS ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=The%20pathogenesis%20of%20Reye%20syndrome%2C,may%20be%20a%20potential%20pathophysiologic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20is%20also%20associated%20with,oxidative%20stress%20and%20mitochondrial%20dysfunction)). Inadequate electron transport and ATP synthesis result in energy failure.
- **Fatty Acid β-Oxidation** – breakdown of fatty acids in mitochondria (GO:0006635) is blocked in Reye’s (due to mitochondrial toxins or genetic defects) ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=The%20pathogenesis%20of%20Reye%20syndrome%2C,may%20be%20a%20potential%20pathophysiologic)). Consequently, fatty acids accumulate and energy substrates are depleted.
- **Ammonia Detoxification (Urea Cycle)** – converting ammonia to urea (part of GO:0006525, arginine metabolic process) is overwhelmed in Reye’s, leading to systemic and CNS toxicity ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,ICP)).
- **Apoptotic Pathways** – the programmed cell death process (GO:0006915) is activated in neurons under severe stress. Both **intrinsic apoptosis** (mitochondrial pathway involving cytochrome c release, caspase-9) and **extrinsic apoptosis** (death receptor pathways) can contribute to cell loss in global brain injuries ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=reducing%20overall%20efficacy%20,2022)).
- **Neuroinflammatory Response** – an immune response within the brain (GO:0150076 for microglial cell activation) is a common reaction to injury and infection. In CFS and possibly post-viral fatigue states, chronic low-level neuroinflammation (glial activation and CNS cytokine production) is believed to sustain symptoms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9124899/#:~:text=Several%20potential%20disease%20mechanisms%20have,We%20will%20test%20this)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=regulatory%20cells%2C%20and%20NK%20cell,32)). In acute encephalopathies, the inflammatory response is more robust but short-lived, involving infiltration of leukocytes in severe cases and release of IL-1, TNF, and other mediators.
- **Cerebrospinal Fluid Circulation** – the production, flow, and absorption of CSF (GO:0090660) is central to IIH pathology ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11910-025-01420-y#:~:text=9%20,CSF%29%20dynamics)). Normally, a balance exists between choroid plexus secretion and arachnoid granulation absorption. IIH involves a breakdown in this homeostasis, leading to accumulation of CSF and raised pressure.
- **Blood–Brain Barrier Integrity** – maintenance of BBB (GO:0050803 might be relevant) is compromised in various brain disorders. In ischemic injury, hypoxia and MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) lead to loss of tight junctions between endothelial cells, increasing permeability. This **vasogenic edema** process (GO:0002938 for response to vascular leakage) allows proteins and water into the brain parenchyma ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=reducing%20overall%20efficacy%20,2022)).
- **Signal Transduction Pathways** – e.g., **MAPK signaling (GO:0000165)** is activated by stress in neurons and glia during hypoxia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303443/#:~:text=alterations%20further%20affect%20synaptic%20function%2C,studies%20not%20only%20contribute%20to)). MAPK (ERK, JNK, p38) can mediate cell survival or death decisions. In hypoxic dendrites, MAPK and other kinase pathways modulate synaptic receptor phosphorylation and structural plasticity.
- **Immune System Processes** – broadly, the **adaptive immune response** (GO:0002250) and **innate immune response** (GO:0045087) are relevant in CFS and post-infectious encephalopathies. Altered activity of T cells (e.g., CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells) and B cells (antibody production) has been documented ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=Dysfunctional%20immune%20mechanisms%2C%20including%20altered,Additionally%2C%20EBV%27s)). Autoreactive B or T cells could attack neural antigens, or produce pathogenic autoantibodies (as hypothesized in some CFS cases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1094%20,doi))).
- **Metabolic Processes** – various metabolic pathways are perturbed:
  - **Glycolysis** (GO:0006096) and **TCA cycle** (GO:0006099) may be downregulated in CFS, forcing greater reliance on anaerobic metabolism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20is%20also%20associated%20with,oxidative%20stress%20and%20mitochondrial%20dysfunction)).
  - **Branched-chain amino acid catabolism** and other amino acid metabolism (GO:0006520) show abnormalities in some CFS metabolomic studies, tying into the fatigue phenotype ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20is%20also%20associated%20with,oxidative%20stress%20and%20mitochondrial%20dysfunction)).
  - **Lipid metabolism** (GO:0006629) – beyond β-oxidation, general lipid handling is affected in Reye’s (fatty liver) and possibly in IIH (obesity-related lipid signals in the CSF or blood).
- **Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Dynamics** – processes like mitochondrial protein translation and mitophagy (GO:0007005 for mitochondrion organization) might be relevant. In toxic encephalopathies, mitochondria swell and lose function ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,ICP)); the cell’s ability to produce new mitochondria or remove damaged ones influences recovery.
- **Neurotransmitter Transport and Recycling** – e.g., **glutamate uptake (GO:0001504)** by astrocytes is critical after neurotransmission. If transporters (EAATs) are overwhelmed or dysfunctional (as in ischemia when astrocytes lack ATP), glutamate accumulates outside cells, worsening excitotoxicity.
- **Ion Transport and Homeostasis** – Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (GO:0006813 for potassium transport) fails when ATP is low, leading to depolarization and cellular edema (as Na⁺ and water rush into cells). Similarly, Cl⁻ and aquaporin-mediated water transport processes are part of edema formation.

### 4. Key Cellular Components and Structures

Pathogenic processes localize to specific cellular compartments and anatomical structures:

- **Mitochondria** – The powerhouse organelle is central to many of these conditions. In Reye syndrome, mitochondria in liver and brain cells show structural damage (swelling, disrupted cristae) and functional failure ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,ICP)). Loss of mitochondrial ATP production causes energy collapse. In CFS, subtle mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g., lower respiratory chain activity) is postulated; muscle cell mitochondria may produce excess lactate. Therapies like coenzyme Q10 or riboflavin are sometimes tried to support mitochondrial function in these patients.
- **Dendritic Spines & Synapses** – These are the post-synaptic specializations on neurons that mediate synaptic transmission. Hypoxia and ischemia cause retraction or loss of dendritic spines, disconnecting neuronal networks ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303443/#:~:text=hypoxia%20can%20significantly%20alter%20the,hypoxia%2C%20with%20their%20apical%20dendrites)). Synaptic terminals can degenerate if glutamate insult is severe. The synaptic cleft (extracellular space at synapse) can become flooded with neurotransmitters during energy failure. The *postsynaptic density* (a protein-dense region beneath the postsynaptic membrane) is a site where NMDA/AMPA receptors are overactivated in excitotoxicity, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup+-triggered damage. Disruption of synapses underlies cognitive deficits and memory loss after diffuse brain injury ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303443/#:~:text=AMPA%20receptors%2C%20NMDA%20receptors%2C%20and,studies%20not%20only%20contribute%20to)).
- **Cell Membranes and Ion Channels** – The plasma membrane of neurons and glia is where ion gradients are maintained. During insults, membrane lipid peroxidation by ROS can occur, and loss of membrane integrity leads to cell lysis (necrosis). Also important are the **voltage-gated ion channels** (Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, etc.) in the membrane: in ischemia, excessive depolarization opens these channels uncontrollably. In a related aspect, **membrane transporters** in choroid plexus epithelium (for CSF secretion) have been studied – e.g., Na<sup+</sup>/K<sup+>/2Cl<sup–</sup> cotransporters and aquaporins influence CSF formation and intracranial pressure ([journals.lww.com](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2023/01060/idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension_in_patients.9.aspx#:~:text=Medicine%20,Neuroimaging%20findings)).
- **Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB)** – Structurally composed of capillary endothelial cells with tight junctions, a basal lamina, pericytes, and astrocytic end-feet. The BBB is normally highly regulated, but in pathological states it can become permeable. Key components are *tight junction proteins* (occludin, claudins) and transporters (P-glycoprotein, GLUT1). Inflammation can cause endothelial cells to express **ICAM-1/VCAM-1** (adhesion molecules), allowing white blood cells to stick and cross into the brain. A breakdown of the BBB is evident in conditions with vasogenic edema and in some neuroinflammatory diseases. For instance, cytokines like TNF can loosen tight junctions, and free radicals can directly damage the endothelial membrane ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=reducing%20overall%20efficacy%20,2022)). Preserving BBB integrity is critical; agents like corticosteroids or VEGF inhibitors can modulate BBB permeability.
- **Choroid Plexus & Ventricles** – The choroid plexus (a frond-like structure in ventricles) is the site of CSF production. It includes a rich capillary network and a layer of ependymal cells with microvilli. These cells have **carbonic anhydrase** and other transporters that secrete sodium and other ions, driving CSF formation. In IIH, while no structural abnormality is visible in the choroid plexus, its function is effectively upregulated relative to absorption. The **arachnoid granulations** (in dural venous sinuses) are microscopic structures where CSF is absorbed into the blood; any functional blockage here (due to thrombosis, inflammation, or idiopathic causes) will elevate CSF pressure.
- **Astrocyte Foot Processes** – Astrocytes extend processes that wrap around blood vessels (perivascular end-feet) and help induce BBB properties in endothelial cells. They also ensheath synapses and nodes of Ranvier. In edema states, astrocyte foot processes take on water and contribute to swelling. Astrocytes also form the glial limitans, a thin barrier at the brain surface and around blood vessels. Swelling of astrocytes at the glial limitans can contribute to intracranial pressure increases by stiffening the brain’s edges.
- **Extracellular Space** – The interstitial space between brain cells is normally tightly regulated (about 20% of brain volume). In vasogenic edema, this space expands with extravasated fluid (rich in plasma proteins). In cytotoxic edema, cells swell and actually *reduce* extracellular space. The composition of the extracellular space (ions, neurotransmitters, etc.) is crucial; for example, increased extracellular potassium from injured cells can precipitate seizures, and extraneuronal glutamate triggers excitotoxicity.
- **Nucleus and Gene Expression Machinery** – Within cells, pathological signals lead to changes in gene expression. For instance, HIF-1α translocates to the nucleus under hypoxia and turns on genes for glycolysis and angiogenesis. In CFS, some studies noted altered expression of genes related to adrenergic signaling and thermal regulation. The **nucleolus** might be affected in states of cellular stress (nucleolar stress can cause cell cycle arrest or apoptosis via p53).
- **Myelin Sheath** – The multilayered membrane wrapping of axons, made by oligodendrocytes, can degenerate secondarily in many brain disorders (secondary demyelination). For example, in prolonged severe hypoxia, oligodendrocytes may die, leading to demyelination in watershed areas. This is not a primary driver in the highlighted conditions, but loss of myelin will exacerbate neurological deficits and slow recovery of function.

### 5. Disease Progression

Each condition within “other disorders of the brain” has its own timeline and stages of progression:

- **Anoxic Brain Injury (Global Ischemia):** The progression is *acute*. Within seconds of severe oxygen deprivation (e.g., cardiac arrest, asphyxiation), ATP stores exhaust and neurons electrically fail. Over 5–10 minutes, ion homeostasis collapses leading to the massive glutamate-mediated injury described above. An initial loss of consciousness occurs (if global), and within minutes irreversible neuron damage can start in vulnerable areas. In the *hours* after reperfusion or re-oxygenation, a secondary injury phase sets in: inflammatory cells infiltrate (peaking around 24–48 hours), and free radicals cause lipid peroxidation (“reperfusion injury”). Clinically, patients may remain comatose or have seizures during this period due to diffuse cortical dysfunction. By days 3–5, **cerebral edema** often peaks; if intracranial pressure rises too high, brain herniation can occur. Patients who survive the acute phase may awaken with neurological deficits corresponding to the selectively injured regions (e.g. memory loss from hippocampal damage, or motor impairments if motor cortex was affected). In the *chronic phase* (weeks to months), there is some remodeling: glial scar formation happens where necrosis occurred, and surviving neurons can sprout new connections. Neurological recovery or long-term disability depends on the extent of neuron loss. Thus, the sequence is: **trigger** (hypoxia) → energy failure → excitotoxic and oxidative damage (minutes-hours) → edema and inflammation (hours-days) → either death or gradual stabilization with residual deficits (days-weeks) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10076579/#:~:text=reducing%20overall%20efficacy%20,2022)).

- **Reye Syndrome:** The progression is *subacute*, typically unfolding over several days. After an initial viral illness (often flu or varicella) that seems to start recovery, the child abruptly worsens 3–5 days later with recurrent vomiting and mental status changes. This marks the onset of Reye’s encephalopathy, often coinciding with rising ammonia levels from liver failure ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,ICP)). Clinicians historically described **five stages** of Reye syndrome severity, from I (lethargy, vomiting) to II (agitation, delirium, hyperventilation), III (obtundation, coma, decorticate posturing), IV (deep coma, decerebrate rigidity, fixed pupils), and V (seizures, flaccidity, apnea) before death. Not every case progresses through all stages if early intervention (e.g., hyperventilation, mannitol for ICP, dialysis for ammonia) is done. The critical window is early: as liver mitochondrial failure progresses, coagulopathy and hypoglycemia may also occur. The brain edema accumulates rapidly; increased intracranial pressure can cause **brainstem compression** if unchecked ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=degeneration%20of%20the%20proximal%20lobules,ICP)). Death, when it occurs, is usually from **herniation or cerebral pressure irreversible damage** (or sometimes cardiac arrest due to severe metabolic derangements) ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=increase%20in%20diagnosis%20of%20inborn,myocardial%20dysfunction%2C%20cardiovascular%20collapse%2C%20respiratory)). With aggressive care (ICU monitoring, IV glucose, ammonia scavengers, etc.), some children recover fully, while others may have residual neurological impairments (learning disabilities, motor deficits) due to the episode of acute brain swelling. Importantly, Reye’s has become exceedingly rare (especially in developed countries) after the link to aspirin was recognized in the 1980s and aspirin use in febrile children was curtailed ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Reye%20syndrome%20typically%20occurs%20after,of%20Reye%20syndrome%20exceedingly%20rare)). Now many cases that do occur are found to be due to metabolic disorders rather than idiopathic Reye’s.

- **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):** The progression is typically *chronic* but can have acute flare-ups. IIH often begins insidiously in an overweight young woman with complaints of daily headaches that are worse in the morning or when lying down (due to higher ICP). Transient visual obscurations (momentary vision black-outs upon standing or straining) are an early symptom from papilledema. Over weeks to months, if untreated, persistent high intracranial pressure leads to continuous papilledema and potential optic nerve damage. Visual field testing may show an enlarging blind spot and peripheral vision loss. There may also be pulsatile tinnitus (whooshing sound in ears, from transmitted vascular pulsations) and sometimes diplopia (double vision) if cranial nerve VI is compressed causing a lateral rectus palsy. The disease does not follow discrete “stages” but rather a continuum of pressure-related damage. With intervention (weight loss, acetazolamide medication, or surgical shunt/stenting), papilledema and symptoms can improve. If unmanaged, the **end result** is often optic atrophy and permanent visual loss, making blindness the most feared complication ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=The%20understanding%20of%20idiopathic%20intracranial,Contemporary%20insights%20identify)). Unlike a tumor, IIH generally does not cause cognitive impairment or motor deficits – it selectively affects the optic nerves and causes headache pain. However, chronically elevated pressure can in rare cases lead to sixth-nerve palsies and cognitive slowdown (perhaps from chronic headache and pressure). The involvement of systemic metabolic factors means that IIH can wax and wane with weight changes; pregnancy or hormonal shifts can also influence it. Recent data indicate an increasing incidence of IIH paralleling obesity rates, suggesting more patients entering this disease course ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=systemic%20manifestations.%20More%20than%2095,associated%20with%20changes%20in%20intracranial)). Also, some patients have a more fulminant course (malignant IIH) with very rapid vision loss over weeks, requiring urgent surgical intervention.

- **Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS):** The progression is *chronic* and often relapsing-remitting. Many patients can pinpoint a triggering event (a severe infection like mononucleosis, or a significant physical or psychological stress) after which they never returned to their previous health. In the **initiation phase**, the triggering insult (e.g., an acute viral infection) leads to symptoms that never fully resolve, transitioning into persistent fatigue, aches, and neurocognitive problems ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=suggesting%20an%20association%20with%20inflammation,in%20the%20development%20of%20CFS%2FME)). In the ensuing **maintenance phase**, the syndrome is characterized by fluctuations: periods of relative improvement followed by crashes. A hallmark is **post-exertional malaise (PEM)** – exertion of either physical or mental kind can precipitate a profound worsening of symptoms 12–48 hours later, lasting days or weeks. During these crashes, patients may be bedridden, with swollen lymph nodes, sore throats, flu-like feelings, and orthostatic dizziness, in addition to extreme exhaustion. It’s hypothesized that exertion triggers an abnormal metabolic or immune response (e.g., excess lactate, oxidative stress, or inflammatory mediators) that the body struggles to recover from ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20is%20also%20associated%20with,oxidative%20stress%20and%20mitochondrial%20dysfunction)). Over years, some patients improve gradually (especially with lifestyle adjustments and pacing), while others remain significantly impaired. There is no single “end stage” in CFS as in progressive neurodegenerative diseases; rather, it tends to wax and wane without a clear terminal phase. However, quality of life can be severely affected, with many patients unable to work or carry out daily activities. Interestingly, a subset of patients do experience substantial improvement or remission after many years, whereas others have lifelong illness. Current research into long COVID (post-COVID syndrome) suggests a very similar trajectory for some, reinforcing the concept of an initial immune/metabolic trigger followed by chronic dysregulation. Throughout the course of CFS, co-morbid conditions like fibromyalgia, POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), and depression/anxiety can interplay, each needing management. In summary, ME/CFS starts often acutely but then becomes a chronic condition with cyclical exacerbations tied to overexertion or other stressors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20is%20also%20associated%20with,oxidative%20stress%20and%20mitochondrial%20dysfunction)). Management focuses on symptom alleviation and *pacing* to avoid triggering PEM, since pushing through tends to worsen long-term outcomes.

### 6. Phenotypic Manifestations

The varied mechanistic disturbances in “other brain disorders” lead to a range of clinical **phenotypes**. Key manifestations (with corresponding Human Phenotype Ontology terms) include:

- **Raised Intracranial Pressure (HP:0002517):** A common feature in conditions like IIH, cerebral edema, and acute encephalopathies. Clinically, this causes severe *headaches* often with nausea/vomiting (HP:0002315) and **papilledema** (optic disc swelling, HP:0001085) on fundoscopic exam. Patients may also have transient visual blurring or diplopia. Over time, prolonged increased intracranial pressure can result in vision loss due to optic nerve atrophy ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=The%20understanding%20of%20idiopathic%20intracranial,Contemporary%20insights%20identify)). The headaches in IIH are directly due to stretching of pain-sensitive structures (dura, blood vessels) from elevated pressure, and they often worsen with maneuvers that further raise intracranial pressure (like coughing or lying flat). In Reye syndrome or acute hepatic encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure correlates with declining consciousness and is a life-threatening state requiring immediate intervention.

- **Encephalopathy (HP:0001298):** This broad term refers to global brain dysfunction, manifesting as confusion, disorientation, altered consciousness, or coma (HP:0001259). In anoxic injury or Reye’s, a **rapid encephalopathy** develops – patients can progress from being irritable or lethargic to stuporous and comatose as the pathophysiology (neuron injury or edema) advances ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,ICP)). Seizures (HP:0001250) are another feature of severe diffuse brain dysfunction; they commonly occur in acute hypoxic-ischemic injury (due to cortical irritation and ionic imbalance) and in stage III/IV Reye syndrome (from high ammonia and swelling provoking cortical neuronal firing). The **loss of consciousness** in these encephalopathies is directly related to suppression of the reticular activating system and widespread cortical suppression by metabolic/toxic factors. Patients in coma due to hepatic encephalopathy (like Reye’s) often have *asterixis* (a flapping tremor of the hands, though young children may not show it clearly) and decerebrate or decorticate posturing in late stages, reflecting brainstem involvement.

- **Cognitive Impairment (HP:0100543):** Cognitive deficits vary from subtle (in mild cases) to profound. In chronic fatigue syndrome, patients commonly report “**brain fog**,” which is difficulty with concentration, information processing, and short-term memory. This correlates with neuroimaging findings of reduced functional connectivity in attention and executive function networks ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=MRI%20scans%20have%20revealed%20structural,related%20to%20executive%20functions%2C%20cognition)). In survivors of global anoxic injury, **memory impairment** (HP:0002354) is frequent, especially anterograde amnesia, if the hippocampi were damaged – sometimes manifesting as a Korsakoff-like syndrome. *“Apical dendrite damage…affecting cognitive function”* has been documented in hypoxic models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303443/#:~:text=AMPA%20receptors%2C%20NMDA%20receptors%2C%20and,studies%20not%20only%20contribute%20to)), explaining learning and memory problems. Even IIH, which is mostly about pressure on optic nerves, can secondarily affect cognition: chronic headache pain and possible small pressure-related white matter changes might cause slowed information processing. Cognitive testing in IIH patients can show mild attention or memory issues, which often improve after treatment. In Reye’s survivors, if there was intracranial pressure elevation for a prolonged period, some may have long-term cognitive or developmental impairments (depending on age and severity of edema).

- **Chronic Fatigue (HP:0012378)** and **Exercise Intolerance:** By definition, CFS presents with persistent, debilitating fatigue that is not relieved by rest ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=a%20complex%2C%20chronic%20condition%20marked,understanding%20of%20CFS%2FME%2C%20including%20its)). The fatigue is both mental and physical, often described by patients as a complete lack of energy or feeling of exhaustion that interferes with routine tasks. This connects to the cellular energy production issues – muscles may switch to anaerobic metabolism quickly, and the brain’s capacity to sustain alertness is reduced (possibly due to low-grade neuroinflammation and impaired neurometabolic coupling). **Post-exertional malaise (PEM)** is a hallmark symptom where any exertion (e.g., a short walk or intense mental task) can lead to an exacerbation of fatigue and other symptoms starting a few hours later or next day ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=a%20complex%2C%20chronic%20condition%20marked,understanding%20of%20CFS%2FME%2C%20including%20its)). During PEM episodes, patients can also experience flu-like symptoms, increased pain, and even low-grade fevers, indicating an immunological component to the fatigue. This phenotypic feature is relatively unique to ME/CFS and reflects the inability of physiological systems to recover normally after stress, consistent with findings of elevated lactate and oxidative stress post-exercise ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20is%20also%20associated%20with,oxidative%20stress%20and%20mitochondrial%20dysfunction)).

- **Sleep Disturbances (HP:0002360):** Many patients across these conditions have disordered sleep, though for different reasons. CFS patients frequently report unrefreshing sleep – even after a full night, they wake up exhausted (which ties into the concept that sleep does not resolve the underlying pathophysiology). They may also have altered sleep architecture, such as reduced deep sleep and increased nighttime awakenings. In encephalopathies like anoxic brain injury, patients in recovery often experience irregular sleep-wake cycles (due to hypothalamic or brainstem injury). IIH patients may have trouble sleeping because lying flat increases headache pain; some have severe morning headaches that wake them up, fragmenting sleep.

- **Pain and Other Sensory Symptoms:** Headache (HP:0002315) is notable in IIH and sometimes in CFS (where tension-type headaches or migraine-like headaches are common co-morbidities). Muscle and joint pain (HP:0003326 musculoskeletal pain) is part of the CFS symptom complex in many cases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=a%20complex%2C%20chronic%20condition%20marked,understanding%20of%20CFS%2FME%2C%20including%20its)) – this can be understood as a fibromyalgia overlap or as a result of heightened pain sensitivity from central sensitization. In CFS, hypersensitivity to stimuli (light, sound, touch) is also described, potentially due to an overactive central nervous system in the context of neuroinflammation. Reye syndrome and acute encephalopathies can cause irritability (which in a young child may be a sign of headache or just general brain discomfort) but since the patient often rapidly loses consciousness, pain assessment is limited there.

- **Visual Disturbances (HP:0000504):** Specific to IIH is transient visual blurring or obscurations and double vision. Papilledema can transiently disturb optic nerve function, causing moments of blurred vision especially with position changes. A sixth cranial nerve palsy due to high pressure leads to horizontal diplopia (double vision) – a classic but not universal finding in IIH. Over time, unchecked papilledema leads to peripheral vision loss (HP:0001123 visual field defect), usually starting in the inferonasal field (enlarging blind spot). Eventually, severe cases develop loss of visual acuity (HP:0007663) and even complete blindness in one or both eyes ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=The%20understanding%20of%20idiopathic%20intracranial,Contemporary%20insights%20identify)). These visual phenotypes are directly related to the pathophysiological pressure on the optic apparatus.

- **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Though not listed explicitly in the template, it’s worth noting that autonomic nervous system symptoms are seen especially in CFS (and related syndromes). Many CFS patients have orthostatic intolerance (HP:0001278), manifesting as lightheadedness or rapid heartbeat upon standing (POTS). This could be due to neuropathy of small autonomic fibers or central dysregulation. In acute brain injuries, autonomic dysregulation can occur in ICU (e.g., neurostorming with fluctuating blood pressure/heart rate due to brainstem damage).

- **Systemic Features:** Outside the nervous system, some phenotypic features give clues to the pathophysiology:
  - In Reye syndrome, **liver dysfunction** (elevated ammonia, ALT, AST) and **coagulopathy** (from liver failure) are key laboratory phenotypes, and **hypoglycemia** (HP:0001943) is often noted due to depleted hepatic glycogen ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803683-reference#:~:text=Histologic%20changes%20include%20cytoplasmic%20fatty,ICP)). These systemic signs align with the mitochondrial dysfunction in liver cells.
  - In CFS, low-grade fever (HP:0001945) or lymph node tenderness (HP:0002716) can be present, reflecting immune activation.
  - In IIH, systemic hypertension or features of metabolic syndrome may be present given the association with obesity, although not directly caused by IIH, they coexist as part of the metabolic disarray ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=systemic%20manifestations.%20More%20than%2095,associated%20with%20changes%20in%20intracranial)).

Each of these clinical phenotypes is an expression of the underlying disrupted pathways. For example, the **persistent fatigue and post-exertional malaise** in CFS directly relate to impaired energy metabolism and mitochondrial function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=CFS%2FME%20is%20also%20associated%20with,oxidative%20stress%20and%20mitochondrial%20dysfunction)), while the **vision changes in IIH** result from mechanical pressure on optic nerves due to CSF accumulation ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-023-00893-0#:~:text=The%20understanding%20of%20idiopathic%20intracranial,Contemporary%20insights%20identify)). The **cognitive “fog”** experienced in both CFS and after diffuse brain injury corresponds to neuroinflammatory and synaptic connectivity disturbances ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303443/#:~:text=AMPA%20receptors%2C%20NMDA%20receptors%2C%20and,studies%20not%20only%20contribute%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11526618/#:~:text=supporting%20energy%20metabolism,Given%20these%20connections)). Recognizing these phenotypic manifestations alongside their pathophysiological basis is crucial for diagnosis and for developing targeted therapies in these otherwise hard-to-treat brain disorders.
