- Disease Name: Dermatomyositis (DM)
- MONDO ID: MONDO:0005377
- Category: Autoimmune

Pathophysiology description
Dermatomyositis is a systemic autoimmune microangiopathy of skin, skeletal muscle, and frequently lung, characterized by complement-mediated capillary injury, a dominant type I interferon (IFN-I) transcriptional signature, and serologically defined subtypes driven by myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs). Histopathology demonstrates endothelial and myofiber damage with perifascicular atrophy, perivascular/perifascicular inflammatory infiltrates enriched for CD4+ T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and membrane attack complex (MAC; C5b-9) deposition on endomysial capillaries and the sarcolemma, linking complement activation to microvascular ischemia and tissue injury (publication: Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3233/jnd-230168; and supportive review) (honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 1-3, honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 8-10, cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 2-3).

A pervasive IFN-I signature marked by MxA/ISG expression is observed in blood, skin, endothelium, and muscle, and correlates with disease activity; pDCs are present in inflamed tissue and are likely major local sources of IFN-I (publications: Current Rheumatology Reports, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11926-024-01164-7; Children, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/children11091046) (musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2, kobayashi2024advancesinjuvenile pages 13-14). MSAs define phenotypes and risks: anti-TIF1-γ (TRIM33) and anti-NXP2 associate with malignancy; anti-MDA5 (IFIH1) correlates with clinically amyopathic presentations and high risk of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD); anti-Mi-2 (CHD4) is linked to classic cutaneous disease and favorable prognosis; anti-SAE often presents with florid skin disease and delayed weakness (publications and narrative reviews with URLs: Curr Rheumatol Rep 2024, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11926-024-01164-7; Cureus, Jul 2025, https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.88601; Seminars in Immunopathology, Aug 2025, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-025-01054-9) (musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2, cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 3-4, ali2025dermatomyositisfocuson pages 1-2, cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 2-3).

Therapeutically, the IFN–JAK/STAT axis is targetable: JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib; and selective TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor brepocitinib) have shown improvements in refractory cutaneous and systemic disease, including RP-ILD, with emerging safety considerations such as opportunistic infections (publication dates and URLs: Frontiers in Immunology, Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1382728; Rheumatology International, Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-024-05551-2; Expert Opin Pharmacother, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2024.2392021; Clin Exp Rheumatology, Mar 2025, https://doi.org/10.55563/clinexprheumatol/eeglsa) (ma2024therapeuticefficacyand pages 1-2, harada2024baricitinibforantimelanoma pages 7-8, wallwork2024currentevidencefor pages 1-3, paik2025brepocitinibapotent pages 1-2).

1) Core Pathophysiology
- Primary mechanisms: immune-mediated microangiopathy with complement MAC (C5b-9) deposition injuring endomysial capillaries and myofibers; ischemia produces perifascicular atrophy. Concurrent IFN-I–dominated innate immune activation amplifies endothelial activation, antigen presentation (MHC-I upregulation), and leukocyte recruitment (Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases, 2024; Cureus narrative review, 2025) (honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 1-3, honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 8-10, cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 2-3).
- Dysregulated molecular pathways: IFN-I signaling (IFNAR–JAK1/TYK2–STAT1/2), complement activation and MAC assembly, chemokine axes (e.g., CX3CL1–CX3CR1 in lung), and downstream cytokine networks; in anti-MDA5 DM, immune complexes may engage endosomal TLRs to further induce IFN-α (Rheumatology International, 2024; Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024) (harada2024baricitinibforantimelanoma pages 7-8, musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2).
- Affected cellular processes: endothelial activation and injury, antigen presentation/MHC-I upregulation in myofibers, pDC-driven IFN production, macrophage activation/polarization, keratinocyte apoptosis and interface dermatitis in skin (Children, 2024; Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024) (kobayashi2024advancesinjuvenile pages 13-14, musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2).

Anti-TIF1-γ/NXP2 associate with malignancy; anti-MDA5 with RP-ILD; anti-Mi-2 with favorable course; anti-SAE with cutaneous-predominant onset (Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024; Seminars in Immunopathology, 2025; Cureus, 2025) (musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2, ali2025dermatomyositisfocuson pages 1-2, cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 2-3).

- Cell Types (CL): endothelial cells, pDCs, macrophages (CD163+ subsets), CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells/plasma cells, keratinocytes, lung alveolar macrophages (Children, 2024; Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024; Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases, 2024) (kobayashi2024advancesinjuvenile pages 13-14, musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2, honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 1-3).
- Anatomical Locations (UBERON): skin, skeletal muscle, lung (Cureus, 2025; Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024) (cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 2-3, musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2).

3) Biological Processes (GO terms)
- Type I interferon signaling pathway (GO:0060337): central DM signature in skin/muscle/blood (Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024) (musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2).
- Complement activation, MAC assembly (GO:0006956): endomysial capillary and sarcolemmal C5b-9 deposition (Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases, 2024) (honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 1-3).
- Endothelial cell activation (GO:0042118) and leukocyte chemotaxis (GO:0030595): microangiopathy and perivascular inflammation (Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases, 2024) (honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 1-3).

5) Disease Progression (sequence of events)
- Trigger(s): genetic susceptibility and environmental stimuli (e.g., viral RNA sensed by MDA5, UV) initiate innate immune activation with strong IFN-I production by pDCs and other sources (Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024) (musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2).
- Vascular phase: antibody/complement-mediated endothelial injury (MAC deposition) causes capillary dropout and ischemia; clinically, nailfold changes and painful cutaneous ulcers may appear (Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases, 2024; Cureus, 2025) (honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 1-3, cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 3-4).
- Muscle phase: hypoperfusion and IFN-driven immune activation promote perifascicular atrophy, MHC-I upregulation, and inflammatory infiltrates with macrophages, CD4+ T cells, B cells; proximal weakness ensues (Cureus, 2025) (cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 2-3).
- Lung involvement: in anti-MDA5 disease, IFN-driven chemokines (CX3CL1) recruit CX3CR1+ M2 macrophages to the lung, fueling ILD and potential fibrosis; RP-ILD may develop with high mortality without aggressive therapy (Rheumatology International, 2024) (harada2024baricitinibforantimelanoma pages 7-8).

6) Phenotypic Manifestations (HP terms)

- Nailfold capillary abnormalities (HP:0030831) reflect microangiopathy (Cureus, 2025) (cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 3-4).
- Interstitial lung disease (HP:0006530), especially RP-ILD in anti-MDA5 DM, reflects IFN/macrophage-driven lung injury and fibrosis (Rheumatology International, 2024) (harada2024baricitinibforantimelanoma pages 7-8).
- Calcinosis cutis (HP:0000987), especially in juvenile/anti-NXP2 disease, indicates chronic tissue damage and dystrophic calcification (Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024) (musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2).

Evidence items (primary data and statistics; URLs and dates)
- Complement microangiopathy and perifascicular atrophy: “deposition of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) in endomysial capillaries” associates with endothelial/myofiber injury and ischemia; juvenile DM shows capillary loss and small-vessel angiopathy (Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3233/jnd-230168) (honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 1-3, honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 8-10).
- IFN score and prognosis in anti-MDA5 DM: A 2023 cohort showed high IFN-I score correlates with disease activity and poor 3‑month survival; patients with IFN‑I score >4.9 had lower 3‑month survival (72.9% vs. 100%; P=0.044) (Frontiers in Immunology, Mar 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1151695) (rocca2023targetingintracellularpathways pages 3-4).
- JAK inhibitors in DM/PM (single‑arm meta-analysis, 7 studies, n=91): mean CDASI improvement −17.67 (95% CI −20.94 to −14.41); MMT +10.31 (95% CI −2.83 to 23.46). Subgroup CDASI reductions: ruxolitinib −20.00, tofacitinib −18.29, baricitinib −11.2. Reported safety included orolabial HSV and two thromboembolic events (Frontiers in Immunology, Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1382728) (ma2024therapeuticefficacyand pages 1-2).
- Anti-MDA5 DM-ILD treated with JAK inhibitors (literature review/case series): pooled survival ~75.9% (predominantly tofacitinib); baricitinib case series (n=3) improved lung opacities and rescued 2/3; notable CMV reactivation risk—close monitoring recommended (Rheumatology International, Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-024-05551-2) (harada2024baricitinibforantimelanoma pages 7-8).
- JDM JAK inhibitor overview (systematic narrative): Across compiled reports to 2023, muscle improvement in 51/53 (96%); skin improvement in 109/152 (72%); frequent steroid reduction; infections included EBV/CMV/HSV and bacterial/fungal events; hematologic/lipid changes reported (Expert Rev Clin Immunol, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2024.2312819) (kim2024updatesonefficacy pages 3-4, kim2024updatesonefficacy pages 13-14).
- Rationale for TYK2/JAK1 inhibition: IFN-I signaling via IFNAR engages JAK1/TYK2; selective TYK2/JAK1 blockade (brepocitinib) reduces IFN-α/β, IL-12/23, IFN-γ pathways; large phase 3 trial in DM ongoing (VALOR, NCT0543726) (Clin Exp Rheumatology, Mar 2025; https://doi.org/10.55563/clinexprheumatol/eeglsa) (paik2025brepocitinibapotent pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Consensus in recent expert reviews is that DM is best conceptualized as an IFN-driven microangiopathy with autoantibody-defined endotypes that dictate organ risk (malignancy vs. RP-ILD) and may benefit from mechanism-guided therapy, particularly IFN–JAK/STAT pathway inhibition; however, infectious risks (e.g., CMV) and heterogeneity of responses necessitate risk-stratified, monitored use (Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024; Expert Opin Pharmacother, 2024; Rheumatology International, 2024) (musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2, wallwork2024currentevidencefor pages 1-3, harada2024baricitinibforantimelanoma pages 7-8).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Off-label JAK inhibitor use for refractory cutaneous DM and anti-MDA5 DM-ILD (tofacitinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib) with documented improvements in CDASI, muscle scores, and ILD survival in observational cohorts; viral surveillance and infection prophylaxis protocols increasingly implemented in high-risk subsets (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; Rheumatology International, 2024) (ma2024therapeuticefficacyand pages 1-2, harada2024baricitinibforantimelanoma pages 7-8).
- IVIG employed to modulate humoral/complement pathways, with mechanistic support that it can block endomysial complement deposition (Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases, 2024) (honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 8-10).
- Serology-driven risk management: anti-TIF1-γ/NXP2 prompting intensified cancer screening; anti-MDA5 prompting early, aggressive lung-directed therapy and IFN-pathway targeting (Current Rheumatology Reports, 2024; Cureus, 2025) (musai2024recentupdateson pages 1-2, cristofori2025dermatomyositisanarrative pages 3-4).

Recent developments (2023–2024 priority)
- IFN-I score as prognostic biomarker in anti-MDA5 DM: high baseline IFN-I score associated with higher disease activity and lower 3‑month survival (72.9% vs 100%) (Frontiers in Immunology, Mar 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1151695) (rocca2023targetingintracellularpathways pages 3-4).

- Anti-MDA5 DM-ILD case series/review (Mar 2024) supports JAK inhibition in RP-ILD with survival ~75.9% and highlights CMV risk and need for monitoring (Rheumatology International, Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-024-05551-2) (harada2024baricitinibforantimelanoma pages 7-8).

Applications, implementations, and safety
- Implementation: off-label JAK inhibitor regimens (e.g., tofacitinib 5–10 mg BID; baricitinib 2–4 mg daily) with multi-drug background therapy, serial IFN score and viral surveillance (CMV/EBV/BK) in high-risk anti-MDA5 subsets; IVIG used to curb complement-mediated injury (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases, 2024) (ma2024therapeuticefficacyand pages 1-2, honda2024contributionofcomplement pages 8-10).
- Safety: infections (HSV, CMV, bacterial/fungal), cytopenias, lipids/weight changes; in anti-MDA5 DM-ILD, CMV reactivation is common enough to warrant pre-emptive monitoring/antivirals and temporary drug holds (Expert Rev Clin Immunol, 2024; Rheumatology International, 2024) (kim2024updatesonefficacy pages 13-14, harada2024baricitinibforantimelanoma pages 7-8).

Limitations and open questions
- Most interventional evidence remains observational; high-quality randomized, controlled trials of JAK/TYK2 inhibitors and other targeted agents are ongoing. Infection risks, optimal dosing, biomarkers for selection/monitoring (e.g., IFN score cutoffs), and long-term malignancy outcomes by MSA subtype remain active areas of research (Expert Opin Pharmacother, 2024; Clin Exp Rheumatology, 2025) (wallwork2024currentevidencefor pages 1-3, paik2025brepocitinibapotent pages 1-2).
