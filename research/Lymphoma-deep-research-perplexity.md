# The Comprehensive Pathophysiology of Lymphoma: Molecular Mechanisms, Cellular Origins, and Disease Progression

Lymphoma represents a heterogeneous group of malignancies arising from dysregulated lymphoid cells that have undergone malignant transformation through the acquisition of multiple genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental alterations[1][3][7]. As the annual incidence of lymphoma continues to rise globally, understanding the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms driving lymphomagenesis and disease progression has become increasingly critical for developing targeted therapeutic interventions[1]. This comprehensive report synthesizes current knowledge regarding the molecular pathways, cellular mechanisms, and microenvironmental factors that orchestrate lymphoma development, examining both the commonalities and distinctions among the major lymphoma subtypes including B-cell and T-cell lymphomas, as well as Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas[7][10]. The pathophysiology of lymphoma emerges from a complex interplay of acquired genetic mutations affecting proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, dysregulated epigenetic modifications that silence normal regulatory mechanisms, constitutive activation of critical signaling cascades, and profound alterations in the tumor microenvironment that promote malignant cell survival and proliferation while simultaneously suppressing anti-tumor immune responses.

## Cellular Origins and the Role of B-cell Development in Lymphomagenesis

The cellular origin of lymphoma is fundamentally linked to understanding the normal developmental pathways of lymphocytes, as most lymphomas are derived from lymphocytes at specific differentiation stages that accumulate oncogenic mutations during normal developmental processes[3][6]. B-cell development occurs through distinct differentiation steps characterized by specific structural features of the B-cell receptor, and lymphoma cells typically resemble B cells at particular developmental stages, allowing pathologists to infer the cell of origin based on immunophenotypic features[6]. The consensus that has emerged from gene expression profiling and immunophenotypic studies is that most B-cell lymphomas are derived from germinal center B cells or from B cells that have passed through the germinal center, indicating the germinal center's critical role in lymphomagenesis[3][6]. This is particularly true for common B-cell lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which exhibit gene expression patterns and immunophenotypes most closely resembling late-stage germinal center B cells or their immediate descendants[6][8].

The germinal center is a specialized anatomical compartment within secondary lymphoid organs where mature B lymphocytes undergo several critical developmental processes including somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination[3][6][31]. These processes, while essential for generating the diverse antibody repertoire required for effective immunity, inherently carry oncogenic risk as they involve deliberate introduction of genetic alterations into the B cell genome[3][31]. During V(D)J recombination, which occurs at the pro-B cell stage, the recombination-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 create double-strand breaks adjacent to specific recombination signal sequences, and errors in the repair of these breaks can lead to chromosomal translocations that place proto-oncogenes under the control of immunoglobulin enhancers[3][31]. Similarly, the process of somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains, and aberrant targeting of these mutagenic mechanisms to non-immunoglobulin genes can drive oncogenic mutations in genes such as MYC, BCL2, and BCL6[3][31]. Class switch recombination, which allows B cells to change the constant region of their immunoglobulin while maintaining the same antigenic specificity, also involves the activation-induced cytidine deaminase enzyme and creates double-strand breaks that are subsequently repaired, and errors in this repair process frequently generate the translocations characterizing many B-cell lymphomas[3][31].

Despite the general consensus that most B-cell lymphomas derive from late-stage germinal center B cells, there is increasing evidence that some lymphomas, particularly lymphoblastic lymphomas and certain T-cell lymphomas, may originate from more immature lymphoid progenitor cells[3]. Recent studies have demonstrated that specific lymphomas may arise from T-cell progenitors in the thymus, particularly nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase-driven anaplastic large cell lymphoma, suggesting that lymphomagenesis is not restricted exclusively to mature B or T cells[3]. The involvement of immature cells in lymphomagenesis is supported by findings showing that B-cell progenitors may be more susceptible to c-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis than their mature counterparts, and that loss of p53 and overexpression of myc is sufficient to cause lymphoma originating in early B-cell progenitors[3]. These discoveries have led to a revised understanding of lymphoma pathogenesis that encompasses transformation events occurring at multiple developmental stages of lymphocyte differentiation.

## Genetic Drivers and Chromosomal Translocations

Chromosomal translocations involving immunoglobulin loci are hallmark mutations of many types of B-cell lymphoma, and these translocations fundamentally drive lymphomagenesis by placing proto-oncogenes under the transcriptional control of active immunoglobulin enhancers[1][6][10]. The t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation is the most characteristic chromosomal abnormality of follicular lymphoma, occurring in approximately 85% of cases, and results in constitutive activation of the BCL2 oncogene by the enhancers of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus[5][19][57]. This translocation leads to overexpression of BCL2 protein, which functions as an anti-apoptotic factor that prevents programmed cell death and allows cells to survive despite signals that would normally trigger apoptosis[28]. The prevalence of t(14;18) in follicular lymphoma is so characteristic that its presence can be detected in a small fraction of peripheral blood lymphocytes in healthy individuals, suggesting that this translocation alone is not sufficient for malignant transformation and that additional genetic events must accumulate for overt lymphoma development[19].

The t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation is the defining chromosomal abnormality of mantle cell lymphoma, occurring in over 95% of cases, and results in juxtaposition of the CCND1 gene encoding cyclin D1 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus[10][41]. This aberrant expression of cyclin D1 is particularly oncogenic in mantle cell lymphoma because normal mature human B cells express only cyclin D2 or cyclin D3 but no cyclin D1, making this constitutive expression abnormal and tumorigenic[41]. The overexpression of cyclin D1 promotes early G1 progression by accelerating the assembly of active cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes, and this cell cycle dysregulation is further fueled by amplifications of CDK4 that have been associated with tumorigenesis and worse prognosis in some cases[41]. The t(8;14) translocation characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma places the MYC oncogene from chromosome 8 under control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer from chromosome 14, resulting in constitutive transcriptional deregulation of MYC[40][37]. This translocation is present in essentially all Burkitt lymphomas and represents one of the most consistent genetic abnormalities in any malignancy, yet evidence from transgenic mouse models demonstrates that MYC deregulation alone is not sufficient for malignant transformation, as additional genetic lesions must cooperate with MYC to generate disease[40].

Beyond the major translocations, numerous additional genetic alterations have been identified in lymphomas through high-throughput sequencing approaches[1][2][5][16]. Recurrent mutations in genes regulating the epigenome, particularly TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, and EZH2, are found in multiple lymphoma subtypes and appear to drive lymphomagenesis through altered epigenetic regulation[1][2][15][18][59]. TP53 mutations are frequent in high-grade lymphomas and are particularly characteristic of double-hit lymphomas and triple-hit lymphomas, which have MYC rearrangements in combination with BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements and are associated with poor prognosis[13][16]. Mutations in genes encoding components of signaling pathways, including those in the NF-κB pathway such as CARD11, CD79B, and TNFAIP3, and those in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, are commonly identified in lymphomas and constitute driver mutations that promote malignant transformation[5][20][51].

## Dysregulated Signaling Pathways

The JAK/STAT signaling pathway emerges as one of the most critical dysregulated pathways in lymphoma pathogenesis, with multiple mechanisms leading to constitutive activation of this pathway in malignant lymphoma cells[1][4][14][17]. In both Hodgkin lymphoma and many non-Hodgkin lymphomas, STAT3 and STAT5 are constitutively active, and this constitutive activation appears to be mediated through multiple mechanisms including cytokine signaling, direct JAK2 mutations, and interactions with the tumor microenvironment[1][4][14]. The activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway promotes the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, enhances proliferation, and induces the production of cytokines that remodel the tumor microenvironment, including TGF-β, PDGF, and VEGF[1][4]. In lymphomas associated with bone marrow fibrosis, low levels of miR-146a increase STAT3 signaling and promote fibrotic transformation, and TGF-β induces lymphoma cells to produce IL-6, which activates STAT3 and perpetuates the JAK/STAT signaling cascade[1]. The ubiquitous activation of JAK/STAT signaling across multiple lymphoma subtypes and its functional importance in promoting lymphoma cell survival and tumor microenvironment remodeling make this pathway an attractive therapeutic target[1][4][17].

The NF-κB signaling pathway represents another critical dysregulated pathway in lymphoma pathogenesis, with both canonical and alternative NF-κB pathways being constitutively activated through genetic alterations, EBV infection, and microenvironment-dependent signaling[4][17][59]. In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the malignant Reed-Sternberg cells have largely lost their B cell phenotype yet show aberrant activation of NF-κB signaling through multiple distinct mechanisms, including loss or mutation of negative regulators such as A20 and TNFAIP3, amplification of genes within the NF-κB pathway, overexpression of NF-κB pathway genes, and inactivating mutations of tumor suppressor genes[4][17]. In activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, constitutive NF-κB activation is critical for cell survival and is mediated through chronic active B-cell receptor signaling and mutations in pathway components[8]. The NF-κB pathway is activated through multiple receptor-mediated signals including those from CD40, RANK, BAFF, and TNFR family members, and these receptors recruit adaptor proteins including TRAFs that activate both canonical and alternative NF-κB signaling[4][20]. The alternative NF-κB pathway, in particular, appears to be critical in Hodgkin lymphoma, where activation of noncanonical NF-κB has been shown to play a particularly important role in RS cell survival and can be targeted by selective NF-κB pathway inhibitors[17].

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is hyperactivated in multiple lymphoma subtypes and promotes proliferation, survival, and metabolic reprogramming of malignant lymphoid cells[27][30][39][40]. This pathway is activated through multiple mechanisms including tonic B-cell receptor signaling in Burkitt lymphoma, activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, and loss-of-function mutations in PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K[27][30][40]. In Burkitt lymphoma, tonic B-cell receptor signaling engages the PI3K pathway rather than NF-κB-dependent chronic active signaling, and constitutive PI3K activity appears to be central to Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis and chemotherapy resistance[40]. The hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling contributes to lymphoma cell proliferation and survival and promotes metabolic reprogramming toward increased glycolysis and anabolic metabolism to support rapid proliferation[30][39]. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in Burkitt lymphoma cells sensitizes cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and reduces cellular proliferation, supporting the biological importance of this pathway in lymphoma survival[27]. The complexity of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway regulation is reflected in the observation that different lymphoma subtypes may depend on distinct regulatory inputs to this pathway, with some dependent on growth factor receptor signaling while others depend primarily on B-cell receptor-mediated activation.

## Epigenetic Dysregulation and Chromatin Remodeling

Epigenetic modifications, particularly alterations in DNA methylation and histone acetylation, play fundamental roles in lymphomagenesis by disrupting the normal regulation of genes critical for lymphoid differentiation, immune surveillance, and apoptosis[1][2][18][59]. Mutations in TET2 and DNMT3A, genes encoding enzymes that regulate DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, are among the most frequently occurring genetic alterations in lymphomas and occur non-randomly with particularly high frequency in certain T-cell lymphomas where over 80% of patients with DNMT3A mutations also carry TET2 mutations[15][18]. These two epigenetic modifiers function in an epistatic relationship in the methylation-hydroxymethylation pathway yet appear to cooperate to drive lymphomagenesis, suggesting a model of cooperative inhibition where loss of both TET2 and DNMT3A obstructs normal differentiation pathways and leads to malignant transformation[15]. The functional consequences of TET2 and DNMT3A mutations include altered DNA methylation patterns, changed chromatin accessibility at regulatory enhancer regions, and dysregulation of lineage-specific transcription factors that normally drive lymphoid differentiation[15][18].

IDH2 mutations, which are particularly frequent in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas, result in accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate that inhibits TET enzyme activity and leads to genome-wide DNA hypermethylation[18]. This hypermethylation pattern suggests that IDH2 mutations promote lymphomagenesis through altered epigenetic regulation and specifically through impaired TET2 function, establishing a mechanistic link between IDH2 mutations and TET2 loss of function[18]. The presence of IDH2 mutations in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas is associated with a more pronounced T follicular helper cell signature and enhanced T-cell activation through epigenetic modification, and IDH2 mutations tend to generate a more aberrant genome compared with IDH2 wild-type cases, possibly due to inhibitory effects of 2-hydroxyglutarate on DNA repair enzymes[2].

EZH2 mutations, which occur in multiple lymphoma subtypes including follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas, result in alterations to the polycomb repressive complex 2 that dysregulates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation[1][5][59]. Most EZH2 mutations in lymphomas are gain-of-function mutations at the Y641 locus that enhance the catalytic activity of EZH2 and lead to increased silencing of oncogene-related genes by altering enzymatic kinetics[59]. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that non-hotspot EZH2 mutations show molecular heterogeneity compared to the classic Y641F mutation and represent a distinct mechanism of EZH2 dysregulation[59]. The functional consequences of EZH2 mutations include altered histone acetylation patterns, impaired expression of genes involved in immune surveillance and B-cell differentiation, and enhanced germinal center formation with reduced requirement for T-cell help[54]. EZH2 mutations induce a premalignant lymphoma niche by causing preneoplastic germinal center hyperplasia and reprogramming the immune synapse such that EZH2-mutated B cells have decreased requirement for T-cell help and increased dependency on follicular dendritic cells[54].

CREBBP mutations, which encode the transcriptional coactivator CBP, are found in follicular lymphoma and accelerate lymphomagenesis in combination with BCL2 overexpression while simultaneously promoting immune escape through downregulation of antigen processing and presentation[54]. The loss of CREBBP function leads to decreased T-cell infiltration into lymphoma tissues and reduced T-cell-mediated immune pressure on malignant cells[54]. These findings underscore the intimate connection between epigenetic dysregulation and immune evasion in lymphoma pathogenesis, suggesting that epigenetic alterations simultaneously drive malignant transformation while creating a permissive microenvironment for lymphoma growth.

## Viral Contributions to Lymphomagenesis

Epstein-Barr virus represents a well-established causative agent in the pathogenesis of several lymphoma subtypes, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and EBV-associated T-cell lymphomas[32][35]. EBV establishes latent infection in B lymphocytes and expresses a limited set of latent genes including latent membrane proteins, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigens, and Epstein-Barr-encoded RNAs that promote B-cell transformation[32][35]. The LMP1 protein is a well-characterized latent protein that can transform and immortalize not only B cells but also epithelial cells in vitro, and LMP1 acts as a constitutive CD40 mimic by activating the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway[4][35]. In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the expression of viral oncogene LMP1 leads to protein aggregates in the cellular membrane that mimic an active CD40 receptor and similarly activate NF-κB signaling[4]. The lytic replication of EBV also contributes to lymphomagenesis through the expression of lytic genes, particularly BNRF1, which has been shown to promote B-cell lymphomagenesis through induction of the interferon-inducible protein 27[32].

Recent evidence has demonstrated that the lytic gene BNRF1 promotes B-cell lymphomagenesis by inducing expression of interferon-inducible protein 27, which promotes cell proliferation, and that disruption of the BNRF1-IFI27 axis significantly reduces the pathogenicity of lymphoblastoid cell lines in mouse xenograft models[32]. The BNRF1 protein enables efficient viral replication by targeting SMC5/6 cohesin complexes to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and induces centrosome amplification, leading to chromosomal instability even without establishing chronic infection[32]. These observations provide mechanistic insights into how viral oncogenic proteins can drive malignant transformation and highlight the complex interplay between viral genes, cellular pathways, and chromosomal stability in EBV-associated lymphomagenesis.

## The Tumor Microenvironment as a Critical Driver of Lymphoma Pathogenesis

The tumor microenvironment surrounding malignant lymphoma cells plays a fundamentally permissive and sometimes actively pro-tumoral role in lymphoma pathogenesis that goes far beyond providing passive support to malignant cells[4][9][12][49]. The microenvironment is composed of non-malignant immune cells including T lymphocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, as well as stromal cells, blood vessels, and extracellular matrix components, and the composition of immune cells in the microenvironment is associated with clinical outcome and response to therapy[9][12]. In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the malignant Reed-Sternberg cells typically comprise less than 1% of the tumor tissue, while the remaining cells include T cells, B cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and plasma cells that have been actively recruited and maintained by signals from the malignant cells[12][33][36]. This striking discrepancy between the rarity of malignant cells and the abundance of non-malignant cells highlights the profound dependence of Hodgkin lymphoma on microenvironmental factors for malignant cell survival.

The interaction between malignant cells and the microenvironment is mediated by cytokines and chemokines expressed by lymphoma cells that recruit and activate specific cellular populations while simultaneously creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment[4][12][49]. In Hodgkin lymphoma, the Reed-Sternberg cells express multiple interleukins including IL-5, IL-13, and IL-21 that recruit and activate eosinophils, promote fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition, and remodel the tumor microenvironment[4][12]. The expression of IL-13 and other anti-inflammatory cytokines by Reed-Sternberg cells promotes differentiation of macrophages toward an M2 tumor-associated macrophage phenotype that produces immunosuppressive cytokines including IL-10 and TGF-β[4][12]. Additionally, the recruitment and functional reprogramming of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, and tumor-associated macrophages through cytokine signaling creates a profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment that prevents effective anti-tumor immune responses[4][9][12][49].

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the tumor microenvironment demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in immune cell composition, and the presence of high proportions of tumor-infiltrating T cells expressing immune checkpoint molecules such as TIM-3, LAG-3, and PD-1 is associated with poor clinical outcome[9]. Specifically, patients with high proportions of TIM3+ and LAG3+ tumor-infiltrating T cells have significantly worse survival than patients with lower proportions of these checkpoint molecules, suggesting that immune checkpoint-mediated T-cell exhaustion is a critical component of lymphoma pathogenesis[9]. The expression of HLA-ABC and β2 microglobulin on tumor cells correlates with increased T-cell infiltration, and the interplay between HLA expression on tumor cells and the phenotype of infiltrating T cells appears to be critical in determining clinical outcome[9].

The microenvironment in lymphoma is also characterized by profound metabolic alterations that create an immunosuppressive metabolic microenvironment[39]. Glycolytic lymphoma cells hijack glucose from surrounding immune cells, thus restricting T-cell glucose utilization and T-cell metabolism, which impairs anti-cancer immune functions[39]. Additionally, glycolytic tumor cells block T effector cell functions by extruding high quantities of lactic acid, thereby contributing to tumor expansion and immune evasion[39]. These metabolic alterations create a vicious cycle where lymphoma cell-driven metabolic reprogramming simultaneously promotes lymphoma proliferation and suppresses anti-tumor immunity.

## Angiogenesis, Lymphangiogenesis, and Hypoxic Microenvironment

Lymphoma-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels and lymphatic vessels respectively, play critical roles in lymphoma progression by providing increased oxygen and nutrient supply, facilitating metastasis, and recruiting immunosuppressive cells to the tumor microenvironment[26][29]. Hypoxia induces functional responses in lymphatic endothelial cells, including cell proliferation and migration, through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), which serves as the master regulator of cellular oxygen homeostasis and mediates transcriptional activation of lymphangiogenesis through regulation of signaling cascades including VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, TGF-β, and Prox-1[26][29]. The lymphoma-induced hypoxic microenvironment exacerbates tissue hypoxia through oxygen consumption by rapidly proliferating lymphoma cells, insufficient blood supply, and poor lymph drainage[26]. In lymphomas with constitutive activation of JAK-STAT and NF-κB signaling, these pathways directly induce expression of VEGF, PDGF, and other angiogenic factors that promote neovascularization[1][4].

Intratumoral hypoxia is a characteristic feature of lymphoma microenvironments and activates multiple molecular pathways that promote angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis while simultaneously creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment[26][29]. Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis has been positively correlated with infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in lymphoma tissues, and VEGF recruits regulatory T cells to tumors while promoting polarization of macrophages into M2 tumor-associated macrophages, further enhancing the immunosuppressive microenvironment[29][49]. The hypoxic microenvironment recruits myeloid-derived suppressor cells to tumor sites through HIF-1α-dependent mechanisms, and these immunosuppressive cells further restrict anti-tumor immunity through production of immunosuppressive cytokines including IL-10, TGF-β, and through expression of checkpoint ligands[29][49].

## Metabolic Reprogramming in Lymphoma

Lymphoma cells undergo profound metabolic reprogramming to support rapid proliferation and to evade immune surveillance through metabolic competition with immune effector cells[30][39][42]. The shift from oxidative phosphorylation to enhanced glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, is characteristic of many lymphomas and is driven by multiple mechanisms including MYC overexpression, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation, and hypoxia-driven HIF-1α stabilization[39]. In germinal center-like lymphomas, glycolytic metabolism provides major carbon sources for biosynthesis, with glucose oxidation supporting nucleotide synthesis through the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid synthesis[39]. The preferential utilization of glutamine metabolism in some lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma, supports tricarboxylic acid cycle anaplerosis and oxidative phosphorylation metabolism to fuel rapid proliferation[39].

The mTORC1 pathway plays a central role in lymphoma metabolic reprogramming by coordinating anabolic metabolism with proliferation signals[30][39]. Both leucine and glutamine activate mTORC1 through distinct mechanisms involving RagGTPase signaling, and the dependency of lymphoma cells on glutamine suggests potential therapeutic vulnerability to glutaminolysis inhibitors[30][39]. The metabolic reprogramming in lymphoma simultaneously promotes malignant cell proliferation and survival while creating a metabolically hostile microenvironment for anti-tumor T cells, representing a critical mechanism of immune evasion.

## Immune Checkpoint Pathways and Immune Escape

Immune checkpoint molecules including PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, and CTLA-4 play critical roles in regulating anti-tumor immunity and are extensively exploited by lymphomas to evade immune surveillance[50][53]. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is essential for maintaining immune tolerance by regulating T-cell activity, but cancer cells exploit this inhibitory mechanism to create immune privilege[50]. In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, PD-L1 and PD-L2 are amplified on chromosome 9p24.1 and are highly expressed on malignant cells, and the elevated PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and increased PD-1 expression on infiltrating T cells are associated with impaired immune responses[17][50]. The amplification of PDL1 and PDL2 on tumor cells is mediated by PIM serine/threonine kinases on tumor cells through constitutive activation of NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways[17].

Multiple mechanisms control PD-1/PD-L1 expression in lymphomas, including genetic alterations affecting the PD-L1 locus, EBV infection that directly activates PD-L1 promoter through the AP-1/cJUN/JUN-B pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling[17][50]. The expression of LAG-3, TIM-3, and other checkpoint molecules on tumor-infiltrating T cells in lymphomas contributes to T-cell exhaustion and impaired anti-tumor immunity, and recent evidence suggests that combined targeting of multiple checkpoint pathways may be required to overcome the profound immunosuppression in lymphomas[9][50]. Beyond PD-1, the emerging importance of TIM-3 in lymphoma immune evasion is highlighted by the observation that patients with high proportions of TIM-3+ tumor-infiltrating T cells have significantly worse survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma[9].

## Disease Progression and Histologic Transformation

The evolution from indolent lymphomas to aggressive lymphomas, known as histologic transformation, represents a frequent and clinically devastating complication that occurs in 30-40% of follicular lymphoma cases and approximately 5% annually of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases[45][48]. The prognosis of patients following transformation is generally poor, with median survival of approximately 12 months, and the development of histologic transformation is mediated through acquisition of multiple cytogenetic abnormalities in the low-grade lymphoma cells prior to transformation[45]. The genetic lesions identified in transformed lymphomas include genes regulating proliferation such as MYC and MYC-regulated genes, genes controlling the cell cycle including CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and genes regulating programmed cell death including TP53, MYC, and BCL2[45]. Gene expression profiling has revealed that transformation is associated with increased proliferation resulting from cell cycle deregulation, defective DNA damage response, and escape from immune surveillance[51].

In follicular lymphoma transformation specifically, molecular sequencing has revealed that the transformed lymphoma cells arise through clonal evolution from the original follicular lymphoma clone, not from de novo malignant transformation[51]. The absence of BCL2 translocation in follicular lymphoma at diagnosis is associated with transformation into activated B-cell-like large cell lymphoma, and transformation into activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma occurs preferentially from BCL2 translocation-negative and IRF4-expressing follicular lymphomas[51]. The transformed follicular lymphomas are most commonly of germinal center B-cell-like phenotype, but a significant minority of cases is of activated B-cell-like phenotype, demonstrating molecular heterogeneity in transformed follicular lymphoma[51].

## Lymphoma Subtype-Specific Pathophysiology

### Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is genetically, molecularly, and clinically heterogeneous, affecting various pathways that result in the production of abnormally large, aggressively malignant B cells at different stages of their development[8][11]. The molecular classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma into germinal center B-cell-like and activated B-cell-like subtypes has revealed distinct genetic and functional properties with important prognostic implications[8][11]. Germinal center B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma results from exposure of B cells to antigen that triggers B-cell somatic hypermutation during development in the dark zone of the germinal center, while activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma results from exposure of B cells to antigen either in the light zone of the germinal center or after the B cell has left the germinal center[8]. The germinal center kinase signaling pathway is activated in approximately 80% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases, resulting in tumor proliferation and survival, and inhibition of germinal center kinase signaling via knockdown results in decreased cell proliferation and increased cellular death[8].

Activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma requires constitutive activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway to support proliferation and survival through regulation of apoptosis and expression of transcription factors including interferon regulatory factor 4, whereas NF-κB pathway activation is not critical for germinal center B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines[8]. The distinction between B-cell receptor types in the two molecular subtypes has functional significance, with activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma commonly expressing IgM B-cell receptor that signals prosurvival and proliferative signals, while germinal center B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma commonly expresses IgG B-cell receptor that results in plasma cell differentiation signaling[8]. The presence of double-hit or triple-hit translocations involving MYC with either BCL2 or BCL6, or all three, defines a poor-risk category of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with aggressive clinical presentation and dismal prognosis[8][11].

### Follicular Lymphoma

Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent lymphoma and is typically characterized by the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation, which places the BCL2 gene under control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer, resulting in constitutive overexpression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein[5][19][54][57]. The t(14;18) translocation alone is not sufficient for malignant transformation, as this translocation can be found in a small fraction of peripheral blood lymphocytes in healthy individuals, indicating that additional genetic and microenvironmental factors are required for lymphoma development[19][54]. The cellular origin of follicular lymphoma is the germinal center B cell, as follicular lymphoma cells resemble frozen germinal center light zone cells and exhibit ongoing V-region gene mutation, indicating that the malignant clone continues to acquire somatic mutations[54][57].

Recent insights have revealed that follicular lymphoma emerges from committed precursor clones that evolve and disseminate over decades before clinical diagnosis, and these precursor clones might participate in subsequent relapses[54]. The genetic landscape of follicular lymphoma includes frequent mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation, particularly CREBBP and EZH2, with CREBBP loss accelerating lymphomagenesis and promoting immune escape through decreased T-cell infiltration[54]. The premalignant germinal center niche remodeling induced by EZH2 mutations results in preneoplastic germinal center hyperplasia and reprogramming of the immune synapse such that EZH2-mutated B cells have decreased requirement for T-cell help and increased dependency on follicular dendritic cells[54]. The newly revised World Health Organization classification of follicular lymphoma recognizes classic follicular lymphoma as the predominant subtype, while distinguishing subtypes with diffuse growth pattern, unusual cytological features, and follicular large B-cell lymphoma as separate entities based on their distinct biological and clinical properties[57].

### Mantle Cell Lymphoma

Mantle cell lymphoma is characterized by the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation resulting in cyclin D1 overexpression and is distinguished by its aggressive clinical course despite being composed of relatively small lymphoid cells[10][41]. The aberrant cyclin D1 expression in mantle cell lymphoma tumor cells is particularly oncogenic because normal mature human B cells express only cyclin D2 or cyclin D3 but no cyclin D1[41]. The overexpression of cyclin D1 accelerates the assembly of active cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes that drive cell cycle progression through early G1 by phosphorylating retinoblastoma protein and releasing E2F transcription factors[41]. Additionally, amplifications of CDK4 further fuel cell cycle dysregulation and have been associated with tumorigenesis and worse prognosis[41]. Mutations in CDK inhibitor genes including CDK inhibitor 1A and hemizygous deletions in CDK inhibitor 1B have also been identified and are associated with shorter overall survival[41].

### Burkitt Lymphoma

Burkitt lymphoma represents a highly aggressive germinal center B-cell-derived cancer that was instrumental in identifying MYC as an important human oncogene more than three decades ago[40]. The t(8;14) chromosomal translocation placing MYC under the transcriptional control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer is present in all cases of Burkitt lymphoma, but recent genomic studies have uncovered several additional oncogenic mechanisms that cooperate with MYC to create this highly aggressive cancer[40]. The transcription factor TCF-3 is central to Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis, and tonic B-cell receptor signaling sustains Burkitt lymphoma survival by engaging the PI3K pathway rather than NF-κB-dependent chronic active signaling as seen in activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma[40]. TCF-3 promotes cell-cycle progression by transactivating CCND3, which encodes cyclin D3 that regulates the G1-S phase transition, and CCND3 accumulates oncogenic mutations that stabilize cyclin D3 protein expression and drive proliferation[40].

### Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma

Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is distinguished by the rarity of malignant Reed-Sternberg cells, which typically comprise less than 1% of the tumor tissue while the remaining tissue is composed of non-malignant immune cells including T cells, B cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and plasma cells[12][33][36]. The Reed-Sternberg cells are large, often multinucleated cells with a peculiar morphology and an unusual immunophenotype that does not resemble any normal cell in the body, yet HRS cells in nearly all cases derive from B cells and only rarely from T cells[33][36]. The pattern of somatic mutations in their rearranged immunoglobulin V genes suggests that Reed-Sternberg cells are derived from pre-apoptotic germinal center B cells[33]. Despite their rarity, HRS cells are the clonal tumor cells of Hodgkin lymphoma, and the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma is largely driven by aberrant activation of signaling pathways critical for HRS cell survival and by extensive manipulation of the microenvironment[12][33].

The Reed-Sternberg cells show deregulated activation of multiple signaling pathways and transcription factors, with mutations affecting NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathways being particularly frequent[4][14][17]. The dependency of HRS cells on microenvironmental interactions and deregulated signaling pathways means that Hodgkin lymphoma cells require both genetic alterations and support from the microenvironment for malignant cell survival[4][12]. The immunophenotype of Reed-Sternberg cells is unusual with loss of B-cell markers including CD20, CD79a, and PAX-5 due to mutations and/or epigenetic silencing, suggesting that Reed-Sternberg cells have undergone extensive phenotypic changes during malignant transformation[12][36].

### Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma

Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma represents a nodal T-follicular helper cell lymphoma with recurrent somatic mutations in multiple epigenetic regulators, including loss-of-function mutations in TET2, inactivating mutations in DNMT3A, and neomorphic mutations in IDH2[18]. The poor prognosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas makes understanding the underlying biology critical for designing therapies with improved efficacy[18]. TET2 deletion or loss-of-function mutations in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas lead to altered DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at regulatory enhancer regions, suggesting functional epigenetic consequences[18]. A murine model with a hypomorphic TET2 allele does develop T-follicular helper cell-like lymphomas but with prolonged latency, and multiple TET2 mutations are found in individual tumor samples, implying strong selective pressure for TET2 inactivation[18]. The concomitant expression of RhoA-G17V mutations in the setting of hematopoietic TET2 deficiency leads to development of T-follicular helper cell lymphomas, and the requirement for concomitant TET2 loss demonstrates the complexity of multi-hit lymphomagenesis[18].

The frequency of TET2 and other epigenetic mutations in the majority of nodal T-follicular helper lymphomas has generated great interest in utilizing epigenetic therapies, particularly histone deacetylase inhibitors, to target the underlying biological mechanisms[18]. Nodal T-follicular helper lymphomas show significantly improved overall response rates to histone deacetylase inhibitors compared with non-T-follicular helper peripheral T-cell lymphomas, supporting the idea that these lymphomas may be uniquely sensitive to epigenetic modulation[18].

## Conclusion

The pathophysiology of lymphoma emerges from a complex and multifaceted process involving the integration of multiple genetic alterations, epigenetic dysregulation, constitutive activation of critical signaling pathways, and profound remodeling of the tumor microenvironment into a permissive and immunosuppressive niche[1][4][59]. This comprehensive analysis has demonstrated that lymphomagenesis cannot be attributed to single genetic events or signaling abnormalities but rather represents the consequence of stepwise accumulation of mutations affecting oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and epigenetic regulators, operating within a microenvironment actively shaped by malignant cells to promote their survival and progression[3][45][59]. The remarkable heterogeneity of lymphoma, encompassing more than 60 distinct subtypes with unique molecular signatures, cell of origin, and clinical presentations, reflects the multiple pathways through which normal lymphoid cells can undergo malignant transformation[7][10][60].

The cellular origin of lymphoma in specific developmental stages of lymphocyte differentiation fundamentally shapes the molecular pathways implicated in malignant transformation, with germinal center derivation explaining the involvement of somatic hypermutation-associated genes and class switch recombination targets in many B-cell lymphomas[3][6][54]. The identification of specific chromosomal translocations characteristic of certain lymphoma subtypes, such as t(14;18) in follicular lymphoma and t(11;14) in mantle cell lymphoma, has provided critical insights into early transforming events, yet the discovery that these translocations alone are insufficient for malignant transformation has motivated investigation into additional cooperating genetic lesions[19][41][45]. The dysregulation of signaling pathways including JAK/STAT, NF-κB, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR emerges as a nearly universal feature of lymphomas, achieved through diverse molecular mechanisms including direct mutation of pathway components, loss of negative regulators, aberrant cytokine signaling, and viral oncogene expression[1][4][8][27][30].

The emerging understanding that epigenetic dysregulation plays a central and often driver role in lymphomagenesis represents a paradigm shift in lymphoma biology and has opened novel therapeutic avenues, with histone deacetylase inhibitors and other epigenetic modulators showing promising activity in some lymphoma subtypes[18][59]. The tumor microenvironment has evolved from a passive byproduct of malignancy to recognition as an active participant in lymphoma pathogenesis and clinical outcome, with evidence that microenvironmental factors can directly promote malignant cell survival, suppress anti-tumor immunity, and influence response to therapy[4][9][12][49]. The intricate interplay between malignant cells and the microenvironment, mediated through complex networks of cytokines, chemokines, and metabolic competition, represents both a fundamental mechanism of lymphoma pathogenesis and a rich opportunity for therapeutic intervention[1][4][49].

Future progress in lymphoma management will require continued integration of molecular pathology into clinical practice, with precision diagnosis based on genomic and epigenetic characteristics informing targeted therapeutic strategies that address the specific driver alterations and microenvironmental dependencies of individual lymphomas[59]. The development of novel targeted therapies directed against specific molecular drivers including epigenetic regulators, signaling pathway components, and metabolic dependencies, in combination with optimized immunotherapy strategies that overcome the profound immunosuppression orchestrated by lymphomas, holds promise for dramatically improving outcomes in patients with this heterogeneous group of malignancies[18][59]. Understanding the fundamental pathophysiology of lymphoma, as comprehensively outlined in this report, provides the scientific foundation for these therapeutic innovations and establishes the basis for continued advancement toward precise, personalized medicine in lymphoma care.
