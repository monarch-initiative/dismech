Akinetopsia (Motion Blindness) Pathophysiology
Core Pathophysiological Mechanisms
Akinetopsia – also known as motion blindness – is a rare higher visual disorder in which patients lose the
ability to perceive motion, even though their visual acuity for stationary objects remains intact 1 .
Fundamentally, the condition arises from disruption of the brain’s visual motion processing pathway,
primarily due to damage or dysfunction in the extrastriate cortex called area V5 (also known as the middle
temporal visual area, MT) 2 3 . Area V5/MT, together with the adjacent medial superior temporal area
(MST), specializes in encoding the speed and direction of moving stimuli 2 . These motion-processing
neurons are located near the temporo-parieto-occipital junction in each hemisphere 4 . When this region
is impaired bilaterally, the brain can no longer smoothly integrate sequential visual inputs over time –
instead of seeing continuous movement, the viewer perceives a series of static “freeze-frames” or jumping
images of moving objects 5 6 . In effect, the normal perception of motion as fluid change is lost,
confirming that the brain treats motion as a distinct component of vision processed in dedicated neural
circuitry 7 .
Critically, bilateral lesions to area V5/MT are classically associated with global akinetopsia, i.e. complete
motion blindness across the visual field 8 9 . Seminal case studies (e.g. patient L.M.) revealed that
bilateral damage to the lateral occipitotemporal cortex encompassing V5 resulted in profound motion
perception loss 10 . L.M. could not perceive movement of objects except under very limited conditions (she
could only detect motion in the far periphery or when object velocity was extremely slow, <10°/s) 11 12 .
This indicates that slow-moving stimuli can sometimes still be perceived thanks to residual pathways,
whereas faster motion fails to register. Indeed, about 10% of primary visual cortex neurons are directionselective and may partially compensate when V5 is knocked out 13 . Such surviving network components
(e.g. direction-sensitive cells in V1/V2, or intact connections in one hemisphere) can mediate rudimentary
motion detection for low velocities or in portions of the visual field 14 . This explains why some akinetopsic
patients report perceiving very slow or small movements but not faster motion – essentially a perceptual
asynchrony where slow objects are seen but anything moving quickly “disappears” or becomes
imperceptible 15 . In other cases, if the lesion is unilateral (affecting V5 in only one hemisphere), patients
may experience a milder deficit or hemiakinetopsia, where motion blindness is restricted to the
contralateral half of the visual field 16 . However, even unilateral V5 damage can substantially degrade
motion perception, especially if the dominant hemisphere’s V5 (often the right side in right-handed
individuals) is affected 17 18 . Overall, the dorsal visual stream (the “where” pathway for motion and
spatial processing) is the locus of pathology in akinetopsia, in contrast to the ventral stream which handles
object form and color 3 . Damage to this dorsal pathway at the level of V5 effectively “cuts off” the brain’s
ability to analyze dynamic visual changes, while static form perception via ventral stream remains intact 3 .

Schematic of the human visual pathways in the brain. The dorsal pathway (blue dashed line, running through
occipital to parietal regions) is responsible for motion and spatial processing (“where”), whereas the ventral
pathway (green dashed line, into the temporal lobe) handles object identity and form (“what”). Visual information
from primary visual cortex (V1, Brodmann area 17) is distributed into these two streams. Area V5 (MT) is a key
node in the dorsal stream (highlighted at the temporo-parietal junction) dedicated to detecting object motion 19 .
Lesions of V5 in the dorsal stream cause akinetopsia, the inability to perceive motion. 19 3
Beyond the cortical anatomy, various pathophysiological insults can disrupt the motion-perception
network. The most common mechanism is structural damage: ischemic stroke in the posterior cerebral
artery territory or traumatic brain injury can infarct or shear the cortical tissue in V5/MST, abolishing
motion processing 20 21 . Neurodegenerative changes can also target the dorsal visual areas – for
instance, patients with the posterior cortical atrophy variant of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have progressive
atrophy in occipito-parietal regions and can develop akinetopsia corresponding to the degree of cortical
damage 22 23 . In such cases, the molecular pathology of AD (amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary
tangles accumulating in visual association cortex) underlies a gradual loss of motion processing neurons
24 . Another mechanistic category is transient functional suppression of V5 activity, as seen in epileptic
seizures or drug effects. For example, focal epileptic discharges in the right temporal or parietal cortex can
propagate and inhibit bilateral MT/V5 function (possibly via aberrant network inhibition through the corpus
callosum), leading to temporary full-field motion blindness until the seizure activity resolves 25 26 . One
case report described a 68-year-old woman whose complex partial seizures in the right frontotemporal
region caused daily episodes where her vision “froze” and lost color, like a black-and-white photograph;
imaging confirmed hyperactivity in frontal regions and suppressed blood flow in bilateral occipital motion
areas during these episodes 25 27 . Treatment with anti-epileptic medication completely abolished the
akinetopsia in this patient, highlighting that the motion blindness was due to reversible cortical dysfunction
rather than permanent damage 28 . Similarly, pharmacological suppression of motion pathways has been
documented: the antidepressant nefazodone (a serotonergic drug) at high doses can induce reversible
akinetopsia, with patients describing a “bizarre derangement” of vision where moving objects appeared as a
sequence of freeze-frame images 6 . This drug effect is thought to reflect selective impairment of neural
signaling in the dorsal stream (perhaps via serotonin receptors or downstream cortical circuits), again
indicating how critical intact cortical network function is for motion perception 6 . In summary, regardless

2

of trigger, the core pathophysiology of akinetopsia is the disruption of neural activity in the MT/V5
network, which prevents the normal integration of visual snapshots into a fluid temporal continuum. If the
impairment is bilateral and permanent (e.g. a bilateral cortical lesion), the motion blindness is global and
enduring 9 . If the disruption is partial, unilateral, or transient (e.g. a small lesion, one hemisphere, or an
episodic suppression), the deficit may be incomplete, affecting only part of the visual field or only certain
conditions (fast motion, low light, etc.), and in some cases may improve if the underlying cause is treated
29
30 .

Key Molecular and Cellular Players
• Genes/Proteins: Notably, no single gene mutation has been identified as a direct cause of
akinetopsia – it is usually an acquired cortical syndrome rather than a familial genetic disorder.
Instead, genetic factors play an indirect role via underlying diseases. For example, in rare instances
akinetopsia occurs in Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias; here, genes like APP (Amyloid
precursor protein, HGNC:620) or PSEN1 (HGNC:9508) that drive AD pathology could be considered
contributory in that they lead to cortical degeneration 22 . (Tsai and Mendez (2009) reported
akinetopsia in a patient with the posterior cortical atrophy form of AD 22 .) However, these genes are
not specific to motion processing. Likewise, risk genes for stroke (e.g. those affecting lipid
metabolism or coagulation) might predispose to the brain infarcts that cause akinetopsia, but no
akinetopsia-specific gene is known. At the protein level, the molecular pathologies underlying
neurodegeneration (such as amyloid-β and tau protein aggregates in AD, or prion protein in CJD)
can damage the visual motion cortex 24 31 . In Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (prion disease), for
instance, rapid accumulation of misfolded prion protein (PrP^Sc) in the occipital lobes has caused
Alice-in-Wonderland-like visual disturbances including akinetopsia 31 . Another protein of interest is
serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the cortex – while not a disease protein per se, modulation of 5-HT
signaling by drugs can induce akinetopsia (nefazodone is a potent 5-HT_2A antagonist/SSRI that
disrupted motion vision 6 ). This suggests that normal neurotransmitter receptor function in MT/V5
neurons is crucial for motion integration. Additionally, signal-transduction proteins involved in
cortical plasticity and connectivity (for example, those in glutamatergic synapses or myelin
maintenance) may influence how the brain compensates for or manifests motion blindness,
although specific candidates are not established in current literature (no OMIM genes are linked to
akinetopsia as of now).
• Chemical Entities: Several chemicals and drugs have been implicated in akinetopsia, either as
triggers or in experimental settings. Nefazodone (an antidepressant in the phenylpiperazine class) is
the best-documented; toxicity of this drug caused selective motion perception impairment in
multiple reports 6 . Patients described it as if their vision turned into a stroboscopic slideshow, an
effect that resolved after the drug was discontinued 6 . Other SSRIs and psychiatric medications
have occasionally been reported to cause similar motion-processing disturbances (likely via
serotonergic or other neuromodulatory pathways in visual cortex) 6 . Recreational hallucinogens
are also notable: LSD and related substances can produce persistent visual perceptual disorders
(Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, HPPD) that include altered motion perception, such as
trailing after-images or a sensation of time slowing 32 33 . These phenomena overlap with
akinetopsia-like symptoms (e.g. illusory slow motion), presumably because hallucinogens disrupt the
normal firing and synchronization of motion-sensitive cortical neurons via 5-HT_2A receptor
agonism. In general, any neurotoxic or intoxicant exposure that affects the occipital or parietal
cortices could, in theory, induce motion blindness. For instance, antiepileptic drugs or migraine

3

medications that alter cortical excitability might precipitate transient akinetopsia in some
susceptible individuals, though such cases are extremely rare. On the other hand, anti-seizure
medications like carbamazepine can treat akinetopsia when seizures are the cause – one patient
with akinetopsia from epileptic seizures due to a parietal AVM had complete symptom resolution on
carbamazepine therapy 34 . This underscores that chemical agents can both precipitate and remedy
motion blindness, depending on whether they disrupt or restore the neural balance in motion
pathways.
• Cell Types: The primary cells affected in akinetopsia are neurons of the visual cortex, especially the
large excitatory pyramidal neurons in area V5/MT that normally respond to moving visual stimuli
(corresponding roughly to layer 4B and 6 output neurons in MT, which project to other cortical areas
and to subcortical structures) 2 . These cortical neurons (often characterized functionally by
direction-selective receptive fields) are the ones that fail to function when V5 is lesioned or
suppressed. Interneurons (such as GABAergic inhibitory neurons) in the motion cortex may also be
involved: for example, excessive inhibition or excitation of local circuits (as in seizures or drug
effects) can shut down the coordinated activity of V5 pyramidal cells 27 . In addition, neurons
upstream and downstream of V5 play roles – the retinal magnocellular ganglion cells (large
retinal neurons that detect motion and project to the lateral geniculate nucleus) provide the initial
input to the motion pathway. These feed into thalamic relay neurons in the lateral geniculate
nucleus (LGN) and then into primary visual cortical neurons (V1), which in turn project to V5 35
36 . While akinetopsia primarily reflects cortical dysfunction, damage to any neurons in this chain
(e.g. LGN cells in a thalamic stroke, or the V1–V5 projection neurons in white matter) could interrupt
the motion signal flow. Notably, MST neurons (in the medial superior temporal area) are another cell
population of interest – they process more complex motion (optic flow, rotation, expansion) and
often work in tandem with MT neurons 2 . If MST is also damaged (it lies adjacent to MT), patients
might experience additional motion disturbances such as loss of optic flow perception (e.g., an
inability to perceive the general movement of the visual scene during self-motion) 37 . In summary,
the critical cell types in akinetopsia are the cortical neurons of the dorsal visual stream (both
excitatory and inhibitory) that collectively encode moving visual information. Glial cells can be
indirectly involved as well – for instance, in demyelinating disease or trauma, oligodendrocytes and
astroglia might be damaged, leading to impaired support for the neurons in motion pathways.
However, the defining cellular event is the dysfunction or loss of the motion-sensitive neurons
themselves, which results in the breakdown of motion perception.
• Anatomical Locations: The anatomical locus of akinetopsia is the visual association cortex in the
posterior cerebrum – specifically the region of the lateral occipital lobe extending into the inferior
parietal and temporal lobes where area V5/MT resides 4 3 . In terms of neuroanatomy, this
corresponds to the temporoparietooccipital junction (often on the banks of the lateral
occipitotemporal sulcus) and is part of Brodmann areas 19/37. Both hemispheres contain a V5 area;
the right hemisphere V5 is thought to be functionally dominant for motion perception in many
individuals 17 . Damage to the right occipitoparietal region is especially common in reported
cases 20 21 . Bilateral lesions (involving V5 on both sides) typically produce the full syndrome,
whereas unilateral right-side lesions can produce motion blindness that may or may not generalize
beyond the contralateral visual field 16 38 . Other brain regions that are part of the motion
perception network include V1 (primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe, Brodmann 17), V2/V3
(secondary visual areas in occipital cortex), MST (often considered part of the dorsal stream in the
parietal lobe), and even the cerebellum (which has connections for visual motion tracking and eye

4

movements) 39 . For instance, some research suggests the cerebellum contributes to smooth
pursuit eye movements and motion prediction; lesions there might compound motion perception
deficits 39 . Anatomically, any lesion encompassing the posterior visual pathways – including the
optic radiations and white matter tracts that connect V1 to V5 – can effectively cause akinetopsia by
disconnecting critical areas. Cases of posterior cortical atrophy in degenerative disease
demonstrate widespread atrophy in the occipito-temporal-parietal junction bilaterally 40 .
Meanwhile, functional causes like seizures may not have a visible lesion, but neuroimaging (e.g.
SPECT, fMRI) shows abnormal activity in frontal or temporal regions and reduced activity in occipital
motion areas during episodes 41 . In summary, the key anatomical substrate of akinetopsia is the
MT+/V5 complex in the lateral occipital cortex (UBERON:0002910), with contributions from
connected areas in the parietal lobe (UBERON:0001384), occipital lobe (UBERON:0000955), and
thalamus (LGN, UBERON:0002111) that together form the dorsal visual stream 39 . Damage to this
network at any point can impair the brain’s representation of visual motion.

Disrupted Biological Processes (GO Terms)
Several biological processes are perturbed in akinetopsia, corresponding to the breakdown of normal visual
and neural functions:
• Visual motion perception (GO:0007601 – visual perception): By definition, the process of detecting
and interpreting moving visual stimuli is disrupted. Normally, the retina-to-cortex pathway encodes
motion via temporal changes in light patterns, which the brain interprets as object movement 19 . In
akinetopsia, this process fails – the integration of sequential visual inputs over time is impaired,
so the perception of motion cannot emerge from the visual stream 5 6 . This can be seen as a
failure of the neural computation of velocity and direction, which is a specialized visual process
subserved by area V5/MT neurons. Essentially, the sensory processing of dynamic visual stimuli is
selectively lost, even though processing of static visual features (shape, color) remains intact.
• Dorsal stream signal transmission and integration: The dorsal visual pathway normally carries
signals related to motion and spatial location from V1 through V5 to the parietal lobe 19 42 . In
akinetopsia, the biological process of transmitting this information and integrating it into a coherent
percept is disrupted. This involves processes like axon-mediated conduction of visual information
(from occipital to parietal cortex) and synaptic transmission between motion-processing
neurons. For instance, neurons in V1 encode simple motion components and relay to V5, where
more complex motion integration (different speeds, directions) occurs; if those synapses or axonal
pathways are damaged, the process fails. Neuronal network synchronization in the beta/gamma
range – often important for binding visual features across time – may also be affected, preventing
the brain from “binding” successive frames into motion. In summary, any biological process involved
in the detection, relaying, or integration of moving visual signals is a candidate for disruption.
This includes photoreceptor and retinal ganglion cell responses to moving stimuli,
thalamocortical relay of transient signals, and especially cortical integration of temporally
changing signals in the dorsal stream.
• Neurotransmitter signaling and cortical excitability: Underlying the loss of motion perception is
often an imbalance or loss of normal neural signaling. In cases of drug-induced or seizure-related
akinetopsia, the process of neurotransmission in visual cortex is transiently altered. For example,
serotonin-modulating drugs interfering with cortical 5-HT receptors suggest that monoaminergic

5

modulation of visual areas is involved in motion processing 6 . Similarly, seizures point to
disrupted ion channel activity and excitatory/inhibitory balance in the cortical networks: the
process of maintaining normal excitability (via GABAergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation) is
perturbed, leading to a functional inhibition of motion processing neurons 27 . In stroke or TBI,
the relevant processes are more degenerative or acute – ischemic cell death, excitotoxicity, and
inflammation in the affected cortex. The moment-to-moment biological process of synaptic
plasticity is also relevant: normally, if one pathway is damaged, the brain might adapt via plastic
changes. There is evidence that residual motion perception can occur via alternate pathways (e.g.
pulvinar or collicular inputs to V5, or neuroplastic reorganization) 13 43 . Thus, processes like
cortical reorganization and visual learning come into play in long-term adaptation, although in
most documented cases true recovery of motion vision is minimal once V5 is destroyed.
• Visual sensory processing in related domains: Often, akinetopsia may co-occur with or be
distinguished from disruptions in other visual processes. For example, some patients also
experience achromatopsia (loss of color perception) if area V4 (ventral stream) is co-damaged 41 .
Others have palinopsia or visual trailing if cortical processing of after-images is affected (as in
HPPD). These indicate that processes such as color perception (GO:0007602) or visual short-term
memory of stimuli could be secondarily involved depending on lesion extent. However, pure
akinetopsia is specifically the selective disruption of motion analysis processes in the brain’s visual
system, making it a unique disturbance of an otherwise intact visual modality.
In terms of formal ontology, akinetopsia entails abnormality of motion perception (HP:0032692) and falls
under agnosia (loss of a specific perception). It highlights how specific neural processing pathways (here,
the visual motion pathway) can be selectively impaired, illustrating a dissociation in the biological processes
of vision.

Cellular and Subcellular Components Involved
On the cellular level, the pathology is rooted in cortical gray matter, where the cell bodies and dendrites
of motion-sensitive neurons reside. Within area V5/MT of the cortex, the synapses and neuronal dendritic
arbors are crucial sites of information processing – this is where incoming signals from V1/V2 are received
and integrated. In akinetopsia due to structural lesions, these synaptic connections and cell bodies are
destroyed or rendered non-functional. For instance, an ischemic infarct will cause neuronal cell death in
layers of V5, and the loss of those neurons’ cell membranes and organelles (such as their mitochondria
and synaptic vesicle machinery) means the local circuit is broken. The synaptic cleft is a particularly
important subcellular site: in drug-induced akinetopsia, it is at synapses (e.g. serotonin synapses onto
cortical neurons) that neurotransmission is altered, effectively silencing the postsynaptic response in the
motion pathway 6 . Thus, receptors on the neuronal membrane (for glutamate, GABA, serotonin, etc.) are
key molecular components whose function (or blockade) can dictate whether motion signals are
transmitted or not.
Additionally, the white matter tracts and axon fibers connecting visual processing areas are critical
cellular components. The myelinated axons from V1 projecting to V5 (and from V5 to parietal cortex) form
part of the visual processing circuit. Damage to these axons – for example, diffuse axonal injury in trauma
or demyelination in multiple sclerosis – can disconnect the pathway. In such cases, the nodes of Ranvier
and oligodendrocyte-myelin units along these axons are indirectly involved in the pathophysiology: if
conduction fails, motion information cannot reach the cortical neurons even if those neurons are intact. In

6

one reported case of traumatic brain injury, the patient developed akinetopsia with evidence of posterior
white matter atrophy, suggesting the connectivity was disrupted 40 .
At the subcellular level, visual cortical neurons rely on calcium signaling and action potential
generation in their axon hillocks to fire in response to motion stimuli. Any disruption in ion channel
function (for instance, due to hypoxia in stroke or abnormal depolarization in seizures) can affect the
cellular excitability of these neurons. Also, synaptic plasticity mechanisms (like long-term potentiation
in visual cortex) could be relevant to how motion perception might recover or not; if the subcellular
machinery for synaptic strengthening (receptors, second messenger systems) is compromised, the network
cannot rewire effectively.
In summary, the key cellular components in akinetopsia include the neuronal cell bodies in area V5, their
dendrites and synapses (the sites of input integration, located in cortical layer I–IV synaptic zones), and the
axons/white matter that connect motion-processing neurons to upstream and downstream areas. The
extracellular environment in the visual cortex is also a factor – for example, adequate cerebral blood flow
in the occipital lobe is necessary to support these cells, and ischemia (lack of blood supply) swiftly deranges
the ionic homeostasis in the extracellular space, leading to neuronal death. Thus, components such as
cerebral blood vessels (capillaries of the visual cortex) are indirectly part of the pathophysiology in
vascular cases. Ultimately, however, it is the loss of functional synaptic networks in the cortical motion
area that underlies the clinical manifestation of akinetopsia.

Disease Progression and Course
Akinetopsia can manifest with different time-courses depending on its underlying cause:
• Sudden Onset with Static Deficit: In cases of acute brain injury – such as a stroke (infarction/
hemorrhage) or head trauma affecting the occipitoparietal region – akinetopsia often has an abrupt
onset. The patient may suddenly notice motion blindness immediately after the neurological event.
For example, a person who suffers a bilateral occipital lobe stroke can awaken to find that moving
objects are no longer perceivable 20 . In these cases, the deficit is immediate and often
permanent. There is typically a single-stage progression: initial loss of motion vision followed by
little recovery. Follow-ups of patient L.M. and similar cases years later have shown essentially no
improvement in motion perception, indicating that once cortical neurons are destroyed, the brain
rarely regains motion vision (short of hypothetical future therapies) 44 . Thus, for vascular or
traumatic causes, the disease progression is characterized by an acute onset and a chronic stable
deficit. One systematic review found that over half of reported akinetopsia cases had continuous,
unremitting symptoms lasting ≥6 months after onset 45 . This chronicity is especially true for
bilateral lesions, which virtually always resulted in long-term or permanent motion blindness 46 .
• Gradual Onset and Progressive Worsening: When akinetopsia is due to an underlying
neurodegenerative process, the symptom may develop insidiously and worsen over time. In the
context of Alzheimer’s disease (particularly the posterior cortical atrophy subtype) or other cortical
degenerations, patients might initially have subtle difficulty tracking moving objects or may get
disoriented by moving scenes. Over months to years, as atrophy in the dorsal visual stream
progresses, the motion perception deficit can become more pronounced 22 47 . For instance, an AD
patient might go from mild trouble in judging moving cars to an inability to see motion at all in later
disease stages. This progressive course mirrors the progression of the neurodegenerative disease

7

itself – motion blindness may be one of several visual-spatial deficits that accumulate. Notably, in a
2024 case report, a patient with brain metastases in the parietal lobes developed akinetopsia that
likely worsened as the metastatic lesions grew, until treatment was given 48 . These scenarios
underscore that when the pathology is progressive, akinetopsia can worsen over time, potentially
going from partial (e.g. only fast motion affected) to complete motion blindness. However, because
akinetopsia is rare, data on its progression in degenerative disease are limited to individual cases.
• Transient or Episodic Course: Akinetopsia can also present as brief episodes that come and go,
particularly in non-structural causes like epileptic activity or drug effects. In focal seizures involving
the visual areas, patients may experience transient motion blindness lasting seconds to minutes,
often with a clear start and end corresponding to seizure activity 25 49 . These episodes may recur
until the seizure focus is controlled. In the case of the 68-year-old with daily akinetopsia episodes
due to epilepsy, her “motion freezes” would recur frequently but each episode was temporary, and
once anti-epileptic medication prevented the seizures, the akinetopsia ceased entirely 28 . Migraine
auras are another possible cause of transient akinetopsia – in the context of Alice in Wonderland
syndrome (often migraine-related), patients can have brief spells of motion distortion that resolve
spontaneously as the migraine passes 50 . Similarly, drug-induced akinetopsia tends to be
reversible and linked to dosing. Patients on high-dose nefazodone developed motion blindness that
improved upon drug withdrawal over days 6 51 . Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder
(HPPD) may cause more chronic lingering symptoms, but these too can fluctuate in intensity and
sometimes gradually improve with abstinence and time. Thus, in paroxysmal or toxic etiologies, the
course can be intermittent or self-limited.
In terms of distinct stages, akinetopsia itself does not have well-defined phases like “early, middle, late” as
some diseases do. Instead, the staging often reflects the underlying disorder. For example, if caused by
Alzheimer’s, one could correlate akinetopsia’s severity with the mild vs. moderate vs. advanced stages of
dementia. If caused by a stroke, one might consider an acute stage (with possible partial recovery in weeks
after as swelling reduces) followed by a chronic stage. A unique scenario was reported by Maeda (2019) in
which a “fresh” occipital infarct caused akinetopsia that completely resolved after prompt treatment with
antiplatelet agents 52 . This implies that in very acute stages of a stroke (before permanent damage sets
in), there might be a reversible stage of cortical dysfunction. Generally, though, once neurons are lost, the
condition enters a stable chronic phase. About half of documented cases were noted to have progressive
or continuous symptoms, whereas a smaller fraction had transient or sporadic episodes 53 . This
heterogeneity in course is a hallmark of akinetopsia’s dependence on diverse etiologies. Clinically, it means
that the prognosis (whether motion vision can return) hinges on the cause: removal of a cause (treating a
seizure, stopping a drug, reperfusing an ischemic penumbra) can lead to improvement, but if the cause
is an irreversible lesion or ongoing degeneration, akinetopsia will likely persist or worsen 54 .

Phenotypic Manifestations and Clinical Correlates
Akinetopsia’s defining phenotype is an inability to perceive motion in the visual field, despite otherwise
normal vision. Patients experience the visual world in a fundamentally altered way: moving objects do not
produce the normal sensation of movement. Instead, many patients describe it as seeing the world in a
series of static images or “snapshots.” For example, a moving person may appear first in one location, then
a split-second later in another, without any fluid intermediate movement – “people were suddenly here or
there but I have not seen them moving,” as one patient vividly reported 55 . This can be likened to a
flickering strobe-light effect or an old cinematic reel where only every few frames are visible 5 56 .

8

Another common description is “freeze-frame vision”: objects in motion look like they momentarily freeze
in one position, then jump to the next position 6 . In one case, a patient said moving objects became a trial
of “freeze-frame images,” as if reality was a broken video feed 6 . Some patients also report the impression
that objects vanish once they start moving – an object that is perfectly visible when still will seem to
disappear or turn invisible as soon as it moves beyond a slow drift 57 . This “vanishing object” phenomenon
is essentially the extreme of motion blindness: the brain only registers the object when stationary, failing to
register it during movement.
The clinical manifestations profoundly affect daily life. Visual tracking of moving targets becomes difficult
or impossible, so activities like following a conversation in sign language, watching sports, or noting the
position of cars while crossing the street are very challenging 56 . Patients often cannot pour liquids
properly because the stream of liquid appears frozen – one classic report noted that a patient saw the tea in
a cup “pile up like a glacier” because she could not see it flowing, risking overflow. Driving is typically unsafe
because the person cannot judge moving traffic or pedestrians 58 . Even walking in a crowd is hazardous;
patients frequently bump into moving people because they only realize someone is in front of them when
it’s too late 59 . Balance and gait can be affected as well – one patient felt uncomfortable walking and
maintaining posture, likely because the optic flow of the environment (which normally informs balance) was
not perceived 59 . Reaching for moving objects is impaired; for instance, an akinetopsic individual will
struggle to catch a ball or even reach for a moving target like a swinging door, since they lose track of where
the target is in mid-motion 60 . These deficits highlight the role of continuous motion feedback in
coordination.
Despite the dramatic motion deficit, other visual functions are often intact. Patients can recognize faces,
read, discern colors (unless a co-lesion causes achromatopsia), and perceive fine details of stationary
objects normally 61 62 . This dissociation – motion vs form – is the hallmark of akinetopsia as a selective
visual agnosia. However, depending on the extent of brain injury, akinetopsia can co-occur with other
visual syndromes. For example, in the context of Balint syndrome (bilateral parietal lesions), one might see
akinetopsia alongside simultanagnosia (inability to perceive multiple objects at once) and optic ataxia,
since all are dorsal stream functions. In Alzheimer’s or PCA, patients might have elements of visual neglect
or other visuo-spatial confusion in addition to motion blindness 22 . One AD case with akinetopsia also had
left hemifield neglect, indicating a broader parietal dysfunction 22 . In epileptic akinetopsia, episodes often
included achromatopsia (loss of color) concurrently 41 , since the seizures affected area V4 as well as V5.
These combinations show that phenotypes can blend if lesions span multiple visual areas.
Psychologically, akinetopsia is disorienting and can be anxiety-provoking. Patients remain aware of the
deficit – unlike some stroke deficits where insight is lost, motion-blind patients typically know that their
perception is abnormal 63 64 . They often develop coping strategies, such as relying more on auditory
cues or touch to detect motion. For instance, they might listen for approaching objects that they cannot
see moving, or physically touch a pouring container to sense vibrations of liquid movement. Some patients
report consciously “training” their hearing to judge distance and movement, effectively substituting
auditory motion cues for visual ones 65 . Still, many everyday tasks become impractical. Watching television
or movies (which rely on perceiving motion from frame sequences) may be confusing or unpleasant. Some
patients withdraw from driving or outdoor activities due to fear of accidents. Quality-of-life surveys specific
to akinetopsia are not well-studied (the condition is too rare), but anecdotal reports underscore a significant
impact on independence and safety 5 66 .

9

In clinical examination, there is no standard “motion perception test” in routine neuro-ophthalmic exams,
but certain observations can be made. A simple bedside test is to throw a ball to the patient; an akinetopsic
patient will have trouble catching it because they lose sight of it in mid-flight 67 . They may also struggle to
estimate the speed of a moving finger or cannot accurately report a moving object’s trajectory.
Interestingly, some patients can detect very slow movement (as noted), so if an object is moved slowly
enough, they might see it, but once it exceeds a threshold speed, it “disappears.” This threshold
phenomenon was documented in patient L.M. (>~10°/s movement could not be perceived) 12 . Another
nuance: because primary visual cortex is intact, patients with akinetopsia still have the reflexive responses
to motion, such as optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) or blindsight for motion. In Riddoch syndrome (the
complement of akinetopsia), cortically blind patients can detect motion without conscious vision; in
akinetopsia, conscious motion perception is gone, but there might be subcortical reflexes like dodging an
oncoming object without “seeing” it move – although this is not well-documented and likely minimal.
In summary, the phenotype of akinetopsia is selective motion blindness: patients cannot smoothly
perceive moving objects, leading to a world experienced in disjointed visual episodes. They maintain normal
recognition of stationary scenes, which helps distinguish akinetopsia from general vision loss. The core
symptom – “life in stop-motion” – can range from mild (trouble with fast motion or crowded movement) to
severe (complete inability to see any motion). This rare syndrome dramatically illustrates the modular
organization of the visual brain: it proves that one can lose the “movie” of vision while keeping the
“pictures.” Each major manifestation, from freeze-frame vision to vanishing moving objects, ties back to the
underlying pathophysiology in area V5 and the dorsal visual stream. Clinicians must be aware that a patient
reporting “I can see things until they move” is describing this unique phenotype, and it usually signals an
injury to the visual motion network 68 69 . Early recognition is important, as treatable causes (like drug
toxicity or seizures) should be addressed promptly to restore normal motion vision 54 .
Evidence: The association of akinetopsia with bilateral V5 lesions was first documented by Zihl et al. (1983)
and Zeki (1991) 70 71 . More recent analyses, such as a 2025 systematic review by Browne et al. (PMID:
39996018), confirm that damage to the MT/V5 complex is the central finding in all cases of motion
blindness 72 3 . Neuroimaging and stimulation studies support this: transcranial magnetic stimulation
over area V5 can transiently induce akinetopsia 73 , and functional MRI shows MT activation correlating
with motion perception. Case reports like Horton & Trobe 1999 (PMID: 10577552) demonstrated druginduced akinetopsia with detailed patient descriptions 6 , and Sakurai et al. 2013 (PMID: 24926238)
showed an example of epileptic akinetopsia with resolution on treatment 49 28 . Pelak & Hoyt 2005
described akinetopsia in Alzheimer’s disease, linking it to posterior cortical atrophy on MRI 40 . These
and other reports form a body of evidence that underpins our understanding of the pathophysiology and
clinical features of akinetopsia, illustrating the crucial role of area V5/MT in visual motion processing and
how its dysfunction leads to the fascinating phenomenon of motion blindness. 2 6
