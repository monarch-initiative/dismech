Title: Pathophysiology of Chickenpox (Varicella) Caused by Varicella‑Zoster Virus (VZV): Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms (2023–2024 Evidence Synthesis)

Disease identifiers
- Disease: Chickenpox (varicella; primary VZV infection)
- Category: Infectious disease (human alphaherpesvirus)
- MONDO: Not retrieved from the provided sources in this run (not reported in the accessed texts).

1. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

1.1 Etiologic agent and lifecycle states
Varicella is the clinical syndrome of primary infection with varicella‑zoster virus (VZV), a human neurotropic alphaherpesvirus that has a biphasic lifecycle: a lytic (productive) phase in permissive tissues and a latent phase in sensory ganglia with highly restricted transcription. (yang2024identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, kennedy2023thespectrumof pages 1-2)

During primary infection, VZV replicates in T cells, producing viremia that disseminates virus to skin and other sites; after resolution, VZV establishes lifelong latency in sensory neurons (dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia are emphasized). (yang2024identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, kennedy2023thespectrumof pages 1-2)

1.2 Clinically relevant “pathophysiology” for chickenpox
In chickenpox, the pathophysiologic hallmark is systemic dissemination (viremia) from a respiratory entry site to the skin, resulting in widespread vesicular lesions; concurrently, VZV gains access to peripheral nerves and sensory ganglia where latent infection is established. (beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19, beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal media 2d139972)

2. Core pathophysiology (molecular/cellular mechanisms)

2.1 Entry and early replication: upper airway → lymphoid tissues
Recent review-level synthesis describes VZV entering via the upper respiratory tract, replicating in mucosa and lymphoid tissues (including tonsils), and then disseminating via infected T cells in the bloodstream. (beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19, beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal media 2d139972)

Consistent with this, a 2024 review focused on vaccine-related neurologic adverse events highlights VZV tropism for tonsillar CD4+ T lymphocytes that express activation/memory and skin-homing features, supporting a mechanism in which infected T cells act as vehicles for systemic spread toward skin. (ramachandran2024seriousneurologicaladverse pages 11-12)

2.2 Viremia and dissemination to skin and nerves (cellular trafficking model)
A 2024 Nature Communications paper reiterates that, in primary infection, VZV replication in T cells “leads to viremia and dissemination to various organs like skin, causing chickenpox,” with subsequent establishment of latency in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. (yang2024identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2)

2.3 Skin infection and lesion formation: productive infection, barrier disruption, and fusogenic spread
VZV productive infection in skin yields vesicular lesions and disrupts normal cutaneous architecture, which contributes to susceptibility to secondary bacterial superinfection. (purohit2024varicellazostervirus pages 1-2)

Mechanistically, VZV envelope glycoproteins are central to entry and cell-to-cell spread in skin: coexpression of gB with gE (and, separately, gH with gL) promotes fusion and syncytium formation; gE is required for viral replication and is functionally supported by gI, with a gE:gI complex implicated in endocytosis; gH/gL is linked to fusion and skin tropism; and gM supports cell-to-cell spread. (xiran2024preliminaryinvestigationand pages 11-11)

2.4 Innate immune dysregulation: type I interferon (IFN-I) antagonism and “immune evasion before entry” via extracellular vesicles
A 2024 Journal of Virology study details multiple VZV proteins that antagonize IFN-I signaling at the IRF3 node: ORF61p induces IRF3 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation; ORF47p blocks IRF3 Ser396 phosphorylation and downstream transcription of IFNβ and ISG15; and the major immediate early transactivator IE-62 inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation in a TBK1-independent fashion. (niemeyer2024suppressionofthe pages 1-2)

The same work proposes a previously undescribed mechanism in which non-infectious small extracellular vesicles released from VZV-infected sensory neurons contain viral and host immunosuppressive cargo and can suppress IFN-I responses in recipient cells, potentially contributing to distant pathologies outside the initial infection focus. This reframes VZV pathogenesis as potentially involving systemic immune modulation by non-virion particles. (niemeyer2024suppressionofthe pages 1-2)

2.5 Antigen presentation and cellular effector dysfunction (adaptive and innate-like T cells)
Evidence from a 2024 PLOS Pathogens study highlights that VZV productively infects and/or functionally disrupts multiple immune subsets (monocytes, dendritic cells, conventional T cells, NK cells), and encodes immune-evasion strategies including downregulation of MHC-I, MHC-II, and NK-cell activating ligands—mechanisms that can impair cytotoxic recognition and antigen presentation during dissemination. (purohit2024varicellazostervirus pages 1-2)

That study also adds a specific immunologic angle: VZV “profoundly impairs” MAIT cell activation and diminishes polyfunctional effector outputs, supporting an additional layer of immune evasion at barrier sites and in circulation. (purohit2024varicellazostervirus pages 1-2)

Complementing these immune findings, a 2024 hiPSC-derived neurospheroid model shows that VZV infection fails to trigger a robust type I IFN response and instead suppresses IFN signaling and antigen-presentation programs, including reduced IL-6 and CXCL10 production, failure to upregulate antiviral ISGs (MX1, IFIT2, ISG15), and reduced expression of CD74 (invariant chain in MHC-II antigen presentation). (govaerts2024varicellazostervirusrecapitulates pages 1-2)

2.6 Neuronal infection and establishment of latency (molecular state)
Primary infection seeds sensory ganglia for lifelong latency. Latency is characterized by restricted viral transcription; a 2024 Nature Communications paper notes VZV latency-associated transcripts (VLTs) and VLT–ORF63 fusion transcripts as prominent features of latency-associated expression patterns, while most lytic genes are silent. (yang2024identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2)

A 2023 Viruses review (focused on reactivation) reinforces the restricted nature of VZV latency transcription and highlights emerging transcriptomic observations (including VLT-related transcripts) and host immune factors affecting control. (kennedy2023thespectrumof pages 1-2)

5. Disease progression: sequence of events and phases (mechanism-linked)

5.1 Stages (canonical model supported by 2024 sources)
Stage 1: Exposure and incubation
- Incubation is reported as 10–21 days (average ~14 days). (beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19, graham2024varicellaoutbreakamong pages 1-2)

Stage 2: Primary replication and lymphoid amplification
- Entry via upper respiratory tract with replication in mucosa and lymphoid tissue (tonsils). (beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19, beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal media 2d139972)

Stage 3: Cell-associated viremia and immune evasion
- Dissemination occurs via infected T cells in blood (T-cell replication → viremia → seeding of skin). (yang2024identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19)
- Concurrently, VZV antagonizes IFN-I signaling (ORF61p/ORF47p/IE62 targeting IRF3) and impairs antigen presentation (MHC-I/MHC-II downregulation; CD74 reduction), limiting immune containment during dissemination. (niemeyer2024suppressionofthe pages 1-2, purohit2024varicellazostervirus pages 1-2, govaerts2024varicellazostervirusrecapitulates pages 1-2)

Stage 4: Cutaneous infection and rash
- Productive infection in skin produces vesicular lesions and barrier disruption; fusogenic glycoprotein machinery (gB/gE; gH/gL) supports cell-to-cell spread. (purohit2024varicellazostervirus pages 1-2, xiran2024preliminaryinvestigationand pages 11-11)

Stage 5: Neuroinvasion and latency establishment
- VZV gains access to peripheral nerves and sensory ganglia during primary infection, establishing lifelong neuronal latency with restricted expression patterns (VLTs; VLT–ORF63 fusion). (yang2024identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19)

5.2 Infectious period and lesion kinetics (clinically relevant physiology)
- Infectiousness begins ~24–48 hours before rash onset and continues until lesions crust (reported ~4–5 days). (beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19)
- Lesions are described as taking ~4 days to crust in a 2024 review. (beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19)

6. Phenotypic manifestations (HPO-style mapping; mechanism links)

Core phenotypes
- Generalized vesicular rash / varicella exanthem (skin infection and spread; fusogenic glycoproteins; barrier disruption) (purohit2024varicellazostervirus pages 1-2, xiran2024preliminaryinvestigationand pages 11-11)

- Pneumonia, encephalitis, bacteremia, secondary bacterial skin superinfection as reasons for hospitalization during a large outbreak (supports real-world relevance of barrier disruption and systemic dissemination). (graham2024varicellaoutbreakamong pages 2-4)

7. Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)

7.1 Immune evasion expanded beyond infected cells: extracellular vesicle model (2024)
A major conceptual development is the demonstration that non-infectious small extracellular vesicles from VZV-infected sensory neurons can suppress type I interferon responses in recipient cells. This suggests VZV pathogenesis may involve systemic immunomodulation at a distance, not solely direct infection at sites of disease. (niemeyer2024suppressionofthe pages 1-2)

7.2 Viral circRNAs and lytic/latent transcript complexity (2024)
Deep sequencing identifies extensive VZV circular RNAs during lytic infection and VLT-like circRNAs, adding a new regulatory layer to VZV gene expression; although the studied paper emphasizes lytic infection and antiviral sensitivity, it also reiterates T-cell-mediated dissemination and defines latency-associated transcript features. (yang2024identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2)

7.3 Human neural 3D models showing IFN and antigen-presentation suppression (2024)
A matured hiPSC-derived neurospheroid model demonstrates that VZV infection is “immunologically ignored” relative to a positive-control virus, with suppression of IFN signaling genes and antigen presentation (e.g., reduced CD74), and emergence of stress granules and cellular integrity disruption with long-term infection. (govaerts2024varicellazostervirusrecapitulates pages 1-2)

7.4 Immune-cell subset specific impairment: MAIT cells (2024)
MAIT cells, an unconventional T-cell subset important in antimicrobial responses, are shown to have impaired activation, cytokine production, and cytolytic potential following VZV infection/exposure, supporting a targeted immune evasion strategy affecting polyfunctional effector responses. (purohit2024varicellazostervirus pages 1-2)

8. Current applications and real-world implementations

8.1 Vaccination as primary prevention (outbreak control)
A CDC MMWR report documents a large varicella outbreak in New York City among recent arrivals (Sept 2022–Mar 2024) with 873 outbreak-associated cases and 28 hospitalizations. Control measures included administration of ~27,000 varicella-containing vaccine doses, and documented immunity among children increased from 28% (Dec 2022) to >80% (Feb 2023), illustrating real-world implementation of vaccination campaigns in congregate settings. (graham2024varicellaoutbreakamong pages 1-2, graham2024varicellaoutbreakamong pages 2-4)

8.2 Antiviral treatment (clinical management, including pregnancy)
In the same outbreak report, pregnant persons with varicella were treated with acyclovir, reflecting standard antiviral implementation in higher-risk groups (and emphasizing the clinical relevance of limiting viral replication/dissemination). (graham2024varicellaoutbreakamong pages 2-4)

9. Relevant statistics and data (recent studies)

9.1 Burden and epidemiology
A 2024 review reports (as background burden estimates) approximately 4 million varicella cases per year in the USA, 100–150 deaths, and >100,000 hospital admissions; it also states that by age 15, up to 80–98% (up to ~90%) of individuals in Europe/North America have been infected, while estimates in low/middle-income countries range from 50–90%. (beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19)

9.2 Outbreak data (2022–2024)
In the NYC outbreak, 91.9% of cases lacked documentation of varicella vaccination at symptom onset, and no deaths were reported. (graham2024varicellaoutbreakamong pages 1-2, graham2024varicellaoutbreakamong pages 2-4)

9.3 Regional surveillance example (China, 2010–2024)
A 2024 Scientific Reports study using surveillance data from Jilin Province, China reports incidence peaks of 30.5 per 100,000 (2009) and 33.89 per 100,000 (2019), and notes sporadic fatalities in some years; the study also describes molecular sampling criteria (specimens with PCR Ct <25 selected for sequencing) and sequencing counts (92 collected, 38 sequenced). (xiran2024preliminaryinvestigationand pages 2-3, xiran2024preliminaryinvestigationand pages 1-2)

10. Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative interpretations from 2023–2024 sources)

- VZV pathogenesis is increasingly understood as requiring efficient early immune evasion for systemic spread; current work emphasizes that “mechanisms of immune evasion prior to virion entry” have been incompletely elucidated and can involve non-infectious extracellular vesicles, broadening expert models of how VZV may contribute to remote complications. (niemeyer2024suppressionofthe pages 1-2)
- Reviews and primary studies converge on a cell-associated dissemination model—particularly T-cell–mediated viremia—to explain how a respiratory entry event produces widespread skin disease and simultaneously seeds ganglionic latency. (ramachandran2024seriousneurologicaladverse pages 11-12, yang2024identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19)

11. Evidence-backed “Pathophysiology description” (knowledge-base ready)

Chickenpox (varicella) is caused by primary infection with VZV. The current evidence-supported model describes entry via the upper respiratory tract, with early replication in mucosa and lymphoid tissue including tonsils, followed by cell-associated viremia in which infected T cells traffic virus through the bloodstream. Dissemination seeds productive infection in skin, where glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell spread and fusion support lesion formation and barrier disruption, predisposing to secondary bacterial superinfection. Concurrently, VZV employs immune evasion mechanisms that inhibit type I interferon induction (ORF61p, ORF47p, and IE62 targeting IRF3 signaling and downstream ISGs) and reduce antigen presentation (MHC-I/MHC-II pathway impacts and CD74 reduction), and it can suppress unconventional T-cell effector programs (MAIT cells). During primary infection, VZV also gains access to peripheral nerves and sensory ganglia, establishing lifelong neuronal latency characterized by restricted transcription dominated by latency-associated transcripts such as VLTs and VLT–ORF63 fusion transcripts. (beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal pages 18-19, beloushi2024congenitalandperinatal media 2d139972, yang2024identificationandcharacterization pages 1-2, xiran2024preliminaryinvestigationand pages 11-11, purohit2024varicellazostervirus pages 1-2, niemeyer2024suppressionofthe pages 1-2, govaerts2024varicellazostervirusrecapitulates pages 1-2, kennedy2023thespectrumof pages 1-2)
