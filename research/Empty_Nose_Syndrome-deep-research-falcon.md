Disease Pathophysiology Research Template

Target Disease
- Disease Name: Empty Nose Syndrome (ENS)
- MONDO ID: Not currently assigned in MONDO (no stable MONDO identifier identified in 2023–2026 literature and databases).
- Category: Complex, post-surgical, neurosensory–aerodynamic disorder

Pathophysiology description
Empty Nose Syndrome is a multifactorial, predominantly postsurgical disorder in which loss or dysfunction of turbinate mucosa alters nasal aerodynamics and sensory transduction, producing paradoxical nasal obstruction, dyspnea, dryness, and pain despite an objectively patent nasal airway. Mechanistic evidence integrates: (1) structural/aerodynamic changes after turbinate reduction that redistribute airflow away from the inferior meatus and reduce mucosal wall shear stress and nasal resistance; (2) peripheral neurosensory dysfunction, especially downregulation/impairment of the trigeminal cool receptor TRPM8 and menthol lateralization; and (3) mucosal remodeling with squamous metaplasia, submucosal fibrosis, and reduced submucosal glands, which impairs air conditioning and mucosal stimulation. Clinical phenotypes link to these mechanisms, and symptom improvement is variably reported with volume-restoring implants or reconstruction; preventive recommendations emphasize mucosal-sparing surgery and preservation of at least 50% of inferior turbinate tissue (details and data below) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3, malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5, wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4, talmadge2019managementofpostsurgical pages 1-2, kudas2025emptynosesyndrome pages 2-4).

1. Core Pathophysiology
- Aerodynamic dysregulation after inferior turbinate reduction. CT-based CFD demonstrates paradoxical redirection of flow to the middle meatus with decreased inferior-meatus flow fraction (from 35.7±15.9% to 17.7±15.7%, p<0.05) and reduced inferior wall shear stress (7.5±4.2×10−2 Pa to 3.4±3.1×10−2 Pa, p<0.01); overall nasal resistance decreases, compounding non-physiologic airflow and reduced mucosal stimulation (The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.26530) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3). Independent analyses confirm localized high-velocity jets in the middle meatus and paucity of inferior-meatus flow in symptomatic ENS, with larger total cross-sectional area in ENS versus controls or turbinate-reduced patients without ENS (International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, May 2019; https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.22350) (malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5).
- Peripheral neurosensory impairment. ENS patients exhibit impaired trigeminal menthol lateralization detection thresholds compared to healthy controls, consistent with reduced TRPM8-mediated cool sensing (p<0.005). ENS mucosa shows significantly lower TRPM8 immunoexpression, providing tissue-level evidence for loss of cool thermoreception (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021; https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.28586; The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.26530) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3).
- Mucosal remodeling and gland loss. Histopathology in ENS demonstrates squamous metaplasia, increased submucosal fibrosis, and decreased submucosal gland density, whereas ciliated respiratory epithelium can be partially preserved. These changes plausibly impair humidification and cooling, reinforcing sensory deficits (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021; https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.28586) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2).
- Integrated pathophysiology and symptom perception. Reviews summarize that loss of turbinate mucosa reduces mucosal cooling and TRPM8 signaling, so “lack of mucosal cooling by airflow is interpreted by the brain as inadequate ventilation,” linked to hyperventilation phenomena reported in up to 77% of patients; predicted air heating/humidification can fall by ~23% after total inferior turbinectomy (Current Opinion in Otolaryngology & Head & Neck Surgery, Aug 2019; https://doi.org/10.1097/moo.0000000000000544) (gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4).

2. Key Molecular Players
- Genes/Proteins (HGNC):
  - TRPM8 (HGNC:17992): transient receptor potential cation channel M8; cool-sensing receptor on trigeminal afferents and nasal mucosa. Downregulated in ENS mucosa by IHC; functional impairment evidenced by menthol lateralization tests (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021; Jun 2017) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3).
- Chemical Entities (CHEBI):
  - Menthol (CHEBI:15882): exogenous TRPM8 agonist used in lateralization testing; activation enhances perceived airflow without changing anatomy, underscoring sensory contribution (The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; Int Forum Allergy Rhinol, May 2019) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3, malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5).
- Cell Types (CL):
  - Sensory neuron, trigeminal-afferent enriched (CL: sensory neuron): impaired cool-sensing via TRPM8 contributes to paradoxical obstruction (The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; Mar 2021) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3, wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2).
  - Respiratory epithelial cell (CL: respiratory epithelial cell): exhibits squamous metaplasia in ENS (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2).
  - Goblet cell (CL: goblet cell): goblet cell metaplasia reported; glandular alterations relate to dryness and secretion abnormalities (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2).
  - Submucosal gland cell (CL: seromucous gland cell): reduced gland density documented, aligning with impaired humidification (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2).
- Anatomical Locations (UBERON):
  - Inferior nasal turbinate/concha, inferior meatus, lateral nasal wall, middle meatus, and overall nasal cavity—primary sites where structural loss, airflow redistribution, and sensory deficits manifest (The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; Int Forum Allergy Rhinol, May 2019) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3, malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5).

3. Biological Processes (GO) disrupted
- Sensory perception of cold and detection of temperature stimulus (TRPM8-mediated): impaired in ENS, supported by menthol lateralization deficits and reduced TRPM8 expression (GO: sensory perception of temperature; detection of cold) (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021; Jun 2017) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3).
- Response to mechanical stimulus and mechanosensory signaling at airway mucosa: reduced wall shear stress and inferior-meatus flow lower mucosal stimulation (GO: response to mechanical stimulus; mechanosensory behavior) (The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; Int Forum Allergy Rhinol, May 2019) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3, malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5).
- Epithelial cell differentiation and squamous metaplasia; extracellular matrix organization and fibrosis (GO: epithelial differentiation; extracellular matrix organization; wound healing) (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2).
- Gland development/function and mucosal secretion affecting humidification (GO: gland development; regulation of secretion) (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021; Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, Aug 2019) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4).
- Airflow conditioning and heat/water exchange processes in upper airway (GO: regulation of body fluid levels; thermoregulation)—functional outcomes inferred from predicted ~23% reduction in heating/humidification after inferior turbinectomy (Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, Aug 2019) (gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4).

4. Cellular Components where key processes occur (GO-CC)
- Plasma membrane of trigeminal sensory neurons and nasal epithelial cells where TRPM8 resides and transduces cool stimuli (GO: plasma membrane) (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2).
- Ciliated apical membrane and periciliary layer of respiratory epithelium where airflow-driven cooling and mechanosensory interactions occur (GO: apical plasma membrane; cilium) (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021; The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3).
- Extracellular region and submucosa where glandular secretions and ECM remodeling (fibrosis) alter mucosal properties (GO: extracellular region; collagen-containing extracellular matrix) (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2).

5. Disease Progression (sequence of events)
- Trigger: turbinate-intervention (often inferior turbinate reduction) or mucosal wound-healing failure produces loss of turbinate tissue and/or function (Facial Plast Surg Clin North Am, Nov 2019; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsc.2019.07.005) (talmadge2019managementofpostsurgical pages 1-2).
- Structural–aerodynamic shift: enlarged cross-sectional area and decreased resistance with redistribution of airflow away from inferior meatus; lower inferior wall shear stress reduces mucosal stimulation (The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; IFAR, May 2019) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3, malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5).
- Peripheral neurosensory deficit: reduced TRPM8 expression and impaired trigeminal cool-sensing diminish afferent signaling of patency (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021; Jun 2017) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3).
- Mucosal remodeling: squamous metaplasia, fibrosis, and gland loss reduce humidification/cooling, reinforcing sensory under-stimulation and dryness (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2).
- Central perception and symptoms: decreased mucosal cooling interpreted as hypoventilation, associated with dyspnea and hyperventilation phenomena (reported up to 77%); patients experience paradoxical obstruction and air hunger (Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, Aug 2019) (gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4).

6. Phenotypic Manifestations (with ontology terms)
- Paradoxical nasal obstruction (HP:0001742) with objective patency; dyspnea/air hunger (HP:0002094); dryness and crusting (HP:0030834 dryness; epistaxis episodes HP:0000421), facial pain (HP:0010745), sleep disturbance, anxiety (HP:0000739), and depression (HP:0000716). These map to aerodynamic under-stimulation (reduced inferior-meatus wall shear) and neurosensory loss (TRPM8) plus mucosal remodeling (The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; IFAR, May 2019; The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021; Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, Aug 2019) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3, malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5, wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4).

Expert opinions and analysis; current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic standardization. The ENS6Q questionnaire and the Cotton test are advocated as validated adjuncts to standardize diagnosis; menthol lateralization testing probes trigeminal cool-sensing function (Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, Aug 2019; IFAR, May 2019) (gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4, malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5).
- Prevention as priority. Experts recommend preserving at least 50% of the inferior turbinate and using mucosal-sparing techniques to minimize risk of ENS (Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, Aug 2019; Facial Plast Surg Clin North Am, Nov 2019) (gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4, talmadge2019managementofpostsurgical pages 1-2).
- Surgical augmentation and reconstruction. Submucosal implants, grafts, and lateral wall reconstruction aim to restore volume/resistance and redistribute airflow toward the inferior meatus; multiple nonrandomized series report symptomatic improvement though high-quality randomized evidence is lacking (IFAR, May 2019; Facial Plast Surg Clin North Am, Nov 2019; 2025 narrative review) (malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5, talmadge2019managementofpostsurgical pages 1-2, kudas2025emptynosesyndrome pages 2-4).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Inferior-meatus flow fraction and wall shear stress significantly decrease post-ITR in ENS patients (from 35.7% to 17.7%, p<0.05; wall shear 7.5×10−2 Pa to 3.4×10−2 Pa, p<0.01); nasal resistance also drops (The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.26530) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3).
- ENS nasal cross-sectional area larger (3.62±3.04 cm2) versus controls (1.34±0.44) and ITR-no-ENS (2.18±0.91), and inferior-meatus distribution reduced (25.8%±17.6% vs 47.7%±23.6% and 36.5%±15.9%; p<0.01) (IFAR, May 2019; https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.22350) (malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5).
- Predicted air heating/humidification reduction ~23% after total inferior turbinectomy; middle and inferior turbinates contribute ~12% and ~15% of nasal air conditioning, respectively (Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, Aug 2019; https://doi.org/10.1097/moo.0000000000000544) (gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4).
- ENS mucosa demonstrates reduced TRPM8 expression with menthol lateralization impairment vs controls (p<0.005), linking TRPM8 dysfunction to symptoms (The Laryngoscope, Mar 2021; https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.28586; The Laryngoscope, Jun 2017; https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.26530) (wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3).

Expert guidance and open questions (2023–2025 emphasis)
- Prevention prioritized: preserve ≥50% inferior turbinate and favor mucosal-sparing surgery; evaluate patients with “functional nasal obstruction” risk profiles before surgery (Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 2019; patient-centered review 2025) (gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4, kudas2025emptynosesyndrome pages 2-4).
- Diagnostics in practice: ENS6Q plus Cotton test and targeted sensory testing (menthol lateralization) help phenotype neurosensory impairment; CFD offers objective visualization of non-physiologic aerodynamics (2017–2019 clinical studies) (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3, malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5, gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4).
- Interventions: Augmentation/reconstruction often improves symptoms in cohorts, but heterogeneity and lack of randomized trials limit certainty; regenerative strategies are conceptually attractive but remain investigational (IFAR 2019; Facial Plast Surg Clin North Am 2019; review 2025) (malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5, talmadge2019managementofpostsurgical pages 1-2, kudas2025emptynosesyndrome pages 2-4).

Concluding synthesis
ENS pathophysiology reflects convergence of non-physiologic aerodynamics (reduced inferior-meatus airflow and wall shear stress; lowered resistance), peripheral trigeminal cool-sensing deficits (TRPM8 downregulation and impaired menthol lateralization), and mucosal remodeling (squamous metaplasia, fibrosis, gland loss). These mechanisms reduce mucosal cooling and mechanosensory input, leading central perception to misinterpret nasal patency as inadequate ventilation, generating paradoxical obstruction, dyspnea, and dryness. Emerging care incorporates preventive surgical principles, standardized diagnostic tools, and volume-restoring reconstruction; mechanistic targeting of neurosensory pathways remains an opportunity for innovation (li2017computationalfluiddynamics pages 1-3, malik2019computationalfluiddynamic pages 3-5, wu2021distincthistopathologycharacteristics pages 1-2, gill2019updateonempty pages 2-4, talmadge2019managementofpostsurgical pages 1-2, kudas2025emptynosesyndrome pages 2-4).
