# Comprehensive Pathophysiology of Crouzon Syndrome with Acanthosis Nigricans: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Manifestations

Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (CSAN) represents a rare autosomal dominant disorder that combines craniofacial abnormalities characteristic of classic Crouzon syndrome with distinctive cutaneous manifestations of acanthosis nigricans. Unlike the more common classic form of Crouzon syndrome, which results from mutations in the *FGFR2* gene, CSAN is caused by a specific point mutation (1172C>A, p.Ala391Glu) in the *FGFR3* gene located on chromosome 4p16.3[1][2]. This molecular distinction leads to a unique pathophysiological presentation that affects multiple organ systems through dysregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling. The disease exemplifies how a single amino acid substitution in a transmembrane domain can have profound consequences for both skeletal development and epidermal homeostasis, resulting in premature fusion of cranial sutures and abnormal keratinocyte proliferation. This comprehensive review examines the molecular basis, cellular mechanisms, and clinical manifestations of CSAN, providing a detailed understanding of how the A391E mutation disrupts fundamental developmental and homeostatic processes.

## Genetic Basis and the A391E Mutation in FGFR3

The fundamental genetic lesion underlying CSAN involves a transversion mutation at nucleotide position 1172 of the *FGFR3* gene, changing cytosine to adenine (1172C>A)[1]. This nucleotide change results in a missense mutation that causes substitution of alanine with glutamic acid at amino acid position 391 (Ala391Glu or A391E) within the transmembrane domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 protein[1][2]. The *FGFR3* gene provides instructions for manufacturing fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that plays critical roles in regulating cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and embryonic development[11]. The transmembrane domain in which the A391E mutation resides is structurally and functionally distinct from extracellular ligand-binding domains and intracellular kinase domains, yet this single amino acid change dramatically alters the protein's biochemical properties.

The substitution of alanine with glutamic acid involves replacing a nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acid with a negatively charged, hydrophilic residue. This change in chemical properties profoundly affects the transmembrane domain's hydrophobic character and its interactions with the surrounding lipid bilayer and adjacent protein sequences[2]. The A391E mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with high penetrance, meaning that individuals carrying a single copy of the mutated allele express the disease phenotype[1]. The mutation has been identified in multiple unrelated families with CSAN, and genetic analysis has confirmed that this specific mutation is the causative agent in all documented cases of CSAN, distinguishing this condition from classic Crouzon syndrome and other FGFR-related craniosynostosis syndromes.

## FGFR3 Structure, Function, and Normal Signaling Mechanisms

The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 protein is a membrane-spanning receptor tyrosine kinase consisting of multiple functional domains that work in concert to transduce extracellular growth factor signals into intracellular signaling cascades[11]. The protein architecture includes an extracellular region containing an N-terminal signal peptide, two immunoglobulin-like domains (IgI and IgII), a third immunoglobulin-like domain (IgIII) that exhibits tissue-specific alternative splicing, an acid box sequence, and a heparin-binding region that stabilizes ligand-receptor interactions. The transmembrane domain anchors the protein in the cell membrane, and the intracellular region contains the juxtamembrane domain, a kinase domain with characteristic tyrosine residues that undergo autophosphorylation, and a C-terminal tail containing additional regulatory tyrosine residues.

In normal cellular conditions, FGFR3 remains in an inactive monomeric state. When extracellular fibroblast growth factors, particularly members of the FGF family such as FGF1, bind to the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains with the assistance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, the receptors undergo a conformational change that promotes lateral dimerization in the cell membrane[9][57]. This dimerization brings two FGFR3 molecules into close proximity, allowing their intracellular kinase domains to phosphorylate each other on specific tyrosine residues, particularly tyrosines 653 and 654 in the activation loop[2][9][57]. These autophosphorylation events activate the kinase domain, which then phosphorylates additional tyrosine residues in the C-terminal tail of FGFR3, creating docking sites for adapter proteins and signaling molecules[25][57].

Once activated, FGFR3 recruits and phosphorylates the adapter protein FGFR substrate 2α (FRS2α), which serves as a critical hub for downstream signal transduction[25]. Phosphorylation of FRS2α enables recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (PTPN11) and the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound 2 (GRB2), which activates the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade leading to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation[9][25]. Additionally, FGFR3 signaling activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/AKT) pathway through recruitment of PI3K via the adapter protein GAB1, leading to protein kinase B activation and downstream effects on cell survival and metabolism[25]. The receptor can also directly phosphorylate and activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which enters the nucleus and modulates gene expression patterns[25][57]. Another important downstream effector is ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2), which is directly phosphorylated by FGFR3 at tyrosine residues and facilitates both ERK1/2 binding and subsequent phosphorylation-mediated activation[10][25].

In tissues such as the growth plate and developing skeleton, FGFR3 signaling plays a suppressive role on bone growth. FGFR3-mediated ERK1/2 activation in chondrocytes inhibits their proliferation and prevents hypertrophic differentiation, thereby negatively regulating endochondral bone formation[15][18][27]. This inhibitory function is critical for maintaining appropriate bone length and appears to be mediated through STAT1-dependent upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and ERK-mediated suppression of gene expression necessary for chondrocyte maturation[18][27][30]. The negative feedback regulation of FGFR3 signaling involves ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of the receptor through the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL, which recognizes phosphorylated FRS2α and targets both FRS2α and FGFR3 for degradation[25][57]. This regulatory mechanism normally limits the duration and intensity of FGFR3 signaling, preventing excessive biological effects.

## Pathophysiological Consequences of the A391E Mutation

The A391E mutation in FGFR3 fundamentally alters the biochemical and biophysical properties of the transmembrane domain, resulting in a gain-of-function receptor that exhibits constitutive activation and enhanced responsiveness to growth factor ligands[2][8]. Comprehensive biophysical studies using cross-linking experiments and Western blot analysis of receptor phosphorylation have revealed that the mutation produces two distinct molecular effects that work synergistically to increase FGFR3 signaling[2][8]. First, the A391E substitution dramatically increases the propensity of FGFR3 molecules to undergo dimerization in the absence of ligand, approximately 1.75-fold higher than the wild-type receptor[2][8]. This enhanced dimerization is likely driven by alterations in the hydrophobic packing interactions within and around the transmembrane domain, as the negatively charged glutamic acid residue alters the electrostatic environment and interfacial properties of the transmembrane helix[2].

Beyond increased dimerization propensity, the A391E mutation also facilitates the phosphorylation of critical tyrosines in the activation loop of FGFR3, particularly the autophosphorylation sites Y653 and Y654[2][8]. When comparing the activation of wild-type and mutant FGFR3 at zero ligand concentration, the mutant receptor exhibits approximately three-fold higher activation levels than wild-type[2]. Importantly, this threefold increase in activation is substantially larger than the 1.75-fold increase in dimerization measured by cross-linking, demonstrating that enhanced phosphorylation efficiency represents an independent effect of the mutation beyond simple geometric considerations[2][8]. The mutation essentially lowers the activation energy barrier for tyrosine kinase domain autophosphorylation, making the kinase domain more efficient at catalyzing its own phosphorylation even when confined within dimeric complexes[2].

When exposed to physiologically relevant concentrations of fibroblast growth factor ligands such as FGF1, the A391E mutant receptor responds across a broad range of ligand concentrations and exhibits a plateau of activation approximately 1.7-fold higher than wild-type FGFR3[2][8]. This enhanced ligand-induced activation indicates that the mutation affects not only ligand-independent (basal) signaling but also amplifies the response to growth factor stimulation. The mutation thus increases FGFR3 signaling through multiple mechanisms: enhanced ligand-independent dimerization and phosphorylation, increased efficiency of ligand-dependent phosphorylation events, and overall amplification of downstream signaling cascade activation across a range of ligand concentrations[2][8][11].

## Cellular and Molecular Basis of Craniosynostosis in CSAN

The premature fusion of cranial sutures characteristic of CSAN represents one of the primary manifestations of aberrant FGFR3 signaling in the developing skeleton. Normal craniofacial development requires a precisely orchestrated sequence of events involving migration and differentiation of cranial neural crest cells, specification of osteogenic progenitor populations, boundary formation and maintenance of cranial sutures, and controlled osteogenic proliferation and differentiation at suture margins[14]. The cranial sutures function as growth zones that allow the flat bones of the skull vault to expand as the underlying brain grows, with the suture mesenchyme containing undifferentiated stem cells derived from paraxial mesoderm and neural crest that maintain suture patency by resisting premature osteogenic differentiation[14][37][40][42].

In normal development, FGFR2 expression is highest in rapidly proliferating osteoprogenitor cells within the suture mesenchyme, while FGFR1 becomes associated with more differentiated states[14]. The transition from FGFR2 to FGFR1 expression is driven by FGF signaling flux, with increased FGF activity promoting osteogenic differentiation and commitment[14][15]. The master transcription factor Runx2 (runt-related transcription factor 2) plays a central role in osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix gene expression, binding to osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements in the promoters of genes encoding bone matrix proteins such as osteocalcin, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and type I collagen[40][41]. Runx2 is negatively regulated by Twist1, which is coexpressed with Runx2 in cells destined to become osteoblasts and prevents osteogenesis by directly binding to the Runt DNA-binding domain of Runx2, blocking its transcriptional activity[40].

The A391E mutation in FGFR3, despite being located on a different chromosome than the classic Crouzon FGFR2 mutations, produces similar craniosynostosis phenotypes through constitutive overactivation of the same downstream signaling pathways[1]. The enhanced FGFR3 signaling in cranial suture mesenchymal cells leads to increased ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathway activation, which promotes osteogenic commitment and differentiation of suture-resident stem cells and osteoprogenitors[9][18][40][41]. This effect is paradoxical compared to FGFR3's normal inhibitory role in growth plate chondrocytes, reflecting the context-dependent nature of FGFR signaling in different developmental compartments and cell populations[14][15][27][30].

The enhanced osteogenic differentiation results from multiple mechanisms. First, increased FGFR3 signaling upregulates expression and activity of Runx2 through ERK1/2-dependent stabilization and acetylation of the protein[9][14]. Second, enhanced signaling promotes expression of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) such as BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7, which activate canonical BMP signaling and further enhance osteogenesis through Smad1/5/8-mediated pathways that synergize with Runx2 activity[14][41]. Third, FGF signaling promotes Wnt pathway activation through ERK-mediated phosphorylation of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), enhancing canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling that drives osteogenic differentiation[25][41]. These coordinated pathway activations converge to suppress the expression of Twist1 and other osteogenesis inhibitors while promoting the full differentiation program of osteoblasts.

The consequence of premature and excessive osteogenic differentiation in cranial sutures is precocious suture fusion, where the undifferentiated suture mesenchyme is replaced by bone and mineralized matrix before the brain has achieved its full growth potential[14][17]. Once a suture fuses, the adjacent skull bones become rigidly attached, preventing further expansion perpendicular to the suture line. The fusion of sagittal, coronal, or lambdoid sutures results in characteristic changes in skull shape as the brain continues to expand but is constrained by prematurely fused sutures. The brain growth redirects toward patent sutures, causing compensatory overgrowth and distinctive deformities including frontal bossing, dolichocephaly, frontal flattening, or occipital flattening depending on which sutures are affected[17][22].

The heightened intracranial pressure that frequently develops in CSAN patients results from multiple mechanisms including restricted skull vault volume, impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption in regions of suture closure, venous outflow obstruction, and upper airway obstruction contributing to carbon dioxide retention[33][36]. Chronically elevated intracranial pressure can cause optic nerve atrophy and visual impairment, developmental delays, seizures, and in severe cases, irreversible brain damage[17][33][36]. The severity of intracranial hypertension correlates with the number of sutures involved and the degree of restriction in skull vault volume, with multisuture involvement carrying substantially higher risk of clinically significant pressure elevation[33].

## Cellular and Molecular Basis of Acanthosis Nigricans in CSAN

Acanthosis nigricans is a cutaneous manifestation characterized by symmetric, velvety, hyperpigmented plaques that commonly appear in skin folds such as the neck, axillae, groin, and inframammary fold[1][3][6]. In general populations, acanthosis nigricans is most commonly associated with insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but can also occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with internal malignancy or as a hereditary condition linked to genetic mutations[3][6][26]. In CSAN, acanthosis nigricans occurs as an inherent component of the syndrome, with the cutaneous manifestations directly attributable to the A391E mutation in FGFR3[1].

The pathophysiology of acanthosis nigricans involves abnormal proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts driven by dysregulated growth factor signaling[3][6][26]. In non-hereditary acanthosis nigricans associated with insulin resistance, the primary mechanism involves hyperinsulinemia leading to excessive activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors on keratinocytes and fibroblasts[3][20][26]. High circulating insulin concentrations displace IGF-1 from its binding proteins, increasing free IGF-1 levels that activate IGF-1 receptors and drive keratinocyte proliferation[3][20][26]. Insulin acting at high concentrations can directly bind to IGF-1 receptors, further amplifying this proliferative signal[3].

In hereditary forms of acanthosis nigricans, including CSAN, the underlying mechanism differs fundamentally from insulin resistance-associated disease. Familial acanthosis nigricans results from mutations in genes encoding fibroblast growth factor receptors, specifically FGFR3 in the case of CSAN[1][3]. The A391E mutation creates a constitutively active FGFR3 that signals autonomously in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, driving proliferation and differentiation of these cell populations even in the absence of extracellular growth factor stimulation[1][2]. The FGFR3 mutations that cause hereditary acanthosis nigricans result in inadequate stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptors in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, paradoxically leading to hyperkeratotic plaques on the flexural areas of the skin[1][3].

The manifestation of acanthosis nigricans specifically on flexural surfaces and skin folds reflects the biology of these specialized microenvironments. These areas experience increased friction, moisture, occlusion, and local accumulation of sweat and sebaceous secretions[3][26]. The mechanical environment of flexural areas may enhance the proliferative effects of dysregulated FGFR signaling through mechanotransduction mechanisms, while the occluded environment facilitates the development of the characteristic velvety plaques through impaired barrier function and altered lipid composition[3][43][46].

Histologically, acanthosis nigricans is characterized by papillomatosis (finger-like projections of the dermal papillae into the epidermis), hyperkeratosis (thickening of the stratum corneum), and minimal but characteristic hyperpigmentation[3]. The dermal papillae exhibit upward projections with thinning of the overlying epidermis, and unlike inflammatory skin conditions, there is typically minimal or absent dermal inflammatory infiltrate[3]. These histological changes reflect the fundamental pathophysiology: excessive proliferation of both epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, with keratinocytes undergoing accelerated differentiation and forming thick, darkly pigmented plaques of keratinized material[1][3][6].

The dysregulated FGFR3 signaling in keratinocytes affects multiple aspects of epidermal homeostasis. ERK1/2 pathway activation drives keratinocyte proliferation and cell cycle progression, while PI3K/AKT signaling promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis[46]. These effects shift the balance between proliferation and differentiation, allowing keratinocytes to accumulate in the epidermis rather than being sloughed off through normal differentiation and desquamation[1][3]. Additionally, dysregulated FGFR signaling affects the expression of tight junction proteins, lipid synthesis enzymes, and other components of the epidermal barrier, compromising barrier function and potentially contributing to the pruritus that some CSAN patients experience[43][46].

The A391E mutation in FGFR3 also affects dermal fibroblasts, which express FGFR3 and respond to FGF ligands[12][20]. Increased FGFR3 signaling in fibroblasts promotes their proliferation and alters their gene expression patterns, enhancing the production of extracellular matrix components, growth factors, and inflammatory mediators that can further stimulate epidermal keratinocyte proliferation through paracrine mechanisms[12][41]. This epithelial-mesenchymal interaction amplifies the local proliferative signal and contributes to the progressive accumulation of hyperkeratotic plaques.

## Tissue Distribution and Cell Type Specificity of FGFR3 Expression

Understanding which cell types express FGFR3 and how they respond to the A391E mutation is critical for comprehending CSAN pathophysiology. FGFR3 is expressed in multiple tissues throughout the body, including chondrocytes in the growth plate cartilage, osteoblasts and osteocytes in bone, keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts in skin, fibroblasts in other connective tissues, and selected neural and vascular cells[11][12][15][18][27]. The specific cell types affected by the A391E mutation are those in which FGFR3 is normally expressed at meaningful levels and where dysregulated signaling produces phenotypic consequences.

In the developing skeleton, FGFR3 is highly expressed in chondrocytes of the growth plate, particularly in resting and proliferating chondrocytes[15][18][27][30]. During normal development, FGFR3 signaling suppresses chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation, acting as a negative regulator of endochondral bone formation[15][18][27]. However, in the cranial vault, which develops through intramembranous ossification rather than endochondral ossification, FGFR3 appears to play a different role. The osteoprogenitor cells within cranial sutures express FGFR receptors, and dysregulated FGFR signaling promotes rather than inhibits osteogenic differentiation in this context[14][15][40][41].

In the epidermis, FGFR3 is expressed in keratinocytes, with particularly strong expression in suprabasal layers[12]. Keratinocytes normally respond to FGF ligands by modulating proliferation, differentiation, and barrier function[12][46]. In CSAN, the constitutively active A391E-FGFR3 continuously signals in keratinocytes, promoting proliferation and abnormal differentiation that manifest as hyperkeratotic plaques characteristic of acanthosis nigricans.

In the dermis, FGFR3 is expressed in fibroblasts[12]. Dermal fibroblasts normally respond to FGF signals by modulating their proliferation and extracellular matrix production. In CSAN, dysregulated FGFR3 signaling in dermal fibroblasts promotes proliferation and enhanced production of growth factors and extracellular matrix that contribute to the hyperplastic dermal component of acanthosis nigricans lesions. Additionally, fibroblasts secrete soluble mediators that can act in paracrine fashion on adjacent keratinocytes, further amplifying the cutaneous phenotype.

## Signaling Pathway Dysregulation in CSAN

The A391E mutation in FGFR3 leads to dysregulation of multiple interconnected signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. The primary activated pathways include the RAS-MAPK cascade, the PI3K-AKT pathway, STAT signaling, and PLCγ signaling[2][9][25][57]. Understanding how these pathways are dysregulated in different cell types and tissues provides insight into the dual craniofacial and cutaneous manifestations of CSAN.

The RAS-MAPK pathway, initiated by FRS2α phosphorylation and GRB2 recruitment, leads to activation of the small GTPase RAS at the cell membrane, which recruits and activates RAF kinase[25][57]. Activated RAF phosphorylates MEK (mitogen-activated kinase kinase), which then phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2 at the cytoplasm and nucleus[25]. In CSAN, the enhanced basal FGFR3 phosphorylation and increased efficiency of ligand-induced phosphorylation result in elevated FRS2α phosphorylation and sustained ERK1/2 activation even at low or absent ligand concentrations[2]. This constitutive ERK1/2 activation drives excessive cell proliferation in osteoprogenitor cells and keratinocytes, promoting premature osteogenic differentiation and keratinocyte hyperproliferation respectively[1][2][9].

The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is activated when PI3K is recruited to phosphorylated FRS2α through the adapter protein GAB1[25]. PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which recruits AKT to the cell membrane where it is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1 and mTORC2[25]. Activated AKT promotes cell survival through phosphorylation and inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins, promotes cell proliferation through mTORC1 activation and increased protein synthesis, and modulates metabolic pathways to support anabolic growth[20][25]. In CSAN, enhanced PI3K-AKT signaling suppresses keratinocyte apoptosis and enhances their survival and proliferation, contributing to epidermal hyperplasia in acanthosis nigricans lesions.

STAT signaling, particularly STAT1 and STAT3 activation, represents another critical dysregulated pathway in CSAN. FGFR3 directly phosphorylates and activates STAT1 and STAT3, which then enter the nucleus and bind to STAT-responsive elements in target gene promoters[25][57]. STAT1 activation in chondrocytes normally promotes expression of cell cycle inhibitors such as p21, suppressing proliferation[25][30]. However, in the context of CSAN where FGFR3 is constitutively active, this suppressive effect on growth is overwhelmed by the simultaneous activation of proliferative pathways like RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT, leading to net promotion of osteogenic differentiation and skeletal overgrowth.

The PLCγ pathway, activated by phosphorylation of PLCγ by the FGFR3 kinase domain, generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) through hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate[25][57]. IP3 diffuses through the cytoplasm and triggers release of calcium ions from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum, while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). These second messengers regulate numerous calcium-dependent and PKC-dependent processes including gene transcription, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cell secretion. In CSAN, dysregulated PLCγ signaling contributes to altered keratinocyte and fibroblast behavior, though this pathway's specific role in CSAN pathophysiology requires further investigation.

## Downstream Effects on Osteogenic Differentiation Pathways

The elevated ERK1/2 signaling resulting from the A391E mutation in FGFR3 produces multiple effects on genes controlling osteogenic differentiation. In osteoprogenitor cells and suture mesenchymal cells, ERK1/2 activation leads to enhanced acetylation and stabilization of Runx2, the master regulator of osteoblast differentiation[9][14][40]. This occurs through ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of coactivators that promote Runx2 acetylation, rendering it more stable and transcriptionally active. Runx2 then binds to osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements (OSE2) in the promoters of bone matrix protein genes including osteocalcin, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and type I collagen, driving their expression[40][41].

Elevated FGFR3 signaling also suppresses the expression of Twist1, a transcriptional regulator that normally antagonizes Runx2 function by directly binding to the Runt DNA-binding domain and preventing Runx2 from recognizing DNA[40]. This suppression of the Runx2 inhibitor further enhances osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, enhanced signaling upregulates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) expression, particularly BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7[14][41]. These secreted signaling molecules activate canonical BMP signaling in responding cells through their type I and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, leading to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad1/5/8[14][41]. Activated Smad complexes bind to Runx2 and act as coactivators, synergizing with Runx2 to drive osteogenic gene expression[41].

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also activated downstream of FGFR3 signaling through an ERK1/2-dependent mechanism. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 phosphorylates low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), a co-receptor for Wnt signaling[25]. This phosphorylation event activates the canonical Wnt signaling cascade, leading to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and stabilization of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Stabilized β-catenin enters the nucleus and associates with TCF/LEF transcription factors, activating Wnt target genes including those encoding osteogenic regulators[41]. Additionally, Wnt signaling directly activates expression of Runx2 and osterix (Osx), another key osteogenic transcription factor[40][41].

Osterix, also called Sp7, is a zinc-finger transcription factor that acts downstream of Runx2 to promote terminal osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix mineralization[40][41]. Enhanced FGFR3 signaling leads to increased expression and activity of Osterix, further promoting osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. The full cascade of osteogenic transcription factors and signaling pathways converges to drive differentiation of suture mesenchymal stem cells toward the osteoblast lineage, promoting the synthesis of bone matrix proteins and their subsequent mineralization, ultimately resulting in premature suture fusion.

## Downstream Effects on Keratinocyte Proliferation and Differentiation

In epidermal keratinocytes, the A391E mutation produces different phenotypic consequences than in bone cells, reflecting cell-type-specific contexts and gene expression patterns. The constitutively active FGFR3 signaling in keratinocytes drives proliferation through ERK1/2 activation, which phosphorylates and inactivates p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and upregulates cyclins and other cell cycle promoting proteins[46]. This enhanced proliferative signaling shifts keratinocytes from the quiescent G0 phase into active cell cycle progression, increasing the size of the basal stem cell compartment and the number of differentiating cells moving through the stratified epithelium[43][46].

Dysregulated FGFR signaling also affects the terminal differentiation program of keratinocytes. In normal skin, as keratinocytes move from basal layers to suprabasal and granular layers, they undergo terminal differentiation characterized by exit from the cell cycle, expression of differentiation-specific markers such as keratins 1 and 10 and involucrin, formation of the cornified envelope through cross-linking of structural proteins, and ultimately desquamation into the external environment[43][46]. Enhanced FGFR3 signaling impairs the terminal differentiation process by maintaining keratinocytes in a proliferative state and preventing their complete maturation[43][46]. This results in accumulation of partially differentiated keratinocytes that retain some proliferative capacity and form the thickened, hyperkeratotic plaques characteristic of acanthosis nigricans.

The epidermal barrier function is also compromised in CSAN. Normal keratinocyte differentiation involves upregulation of lipid biosynthetic enzymes, particularly those involved in synthesis of ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids that form the intercellular lipid matrix essential for barrier function[43][46]. Enhanced EGFR signaling—which can cross-activate from dysregulated growth factor receptors—decreases expression of lipid biosynthetic enzymes and tight junction proteins such as claudins and occludin[43][46]. This impaired barrier function contributes to the increased transepidermal water loss and pruritus observed in some CSAN patients. Additionally, the reduced expression of tight junction proteins affects cell-cell adhesion and intercellular communication, further compromising normal epidermal architecture[43][46].

## Temporal Onset and Clinical Progression

The clinical manifestations of CSAN typically emerge during infancy and early childhood, though the precise timing and severity vary among individuals. Craniosynostosis, the skeletal manifestation of CSAN, is often evident at birth or becomes apparent within the first two years of life as the skull shape becomes progressively abnormal with frontal bossing, hypertelorism, exophthalmos, and mandibular prognathism[1][13][19]. The premature fusion of sutures is typically not visible or only slightly visible at birth but gradually becomes pronounced as the abnormal ossification progresses[19]. The specific sutures involved determine the pattern of skull deformity, with sagittal suture fusion producing dolichocephaly (long, narrow head), bilateral coronal fusion producing brachycephaly (short, wide head), and unilateral coronal fusion producing asymmetric frontal flattening.

Acanthosis nigricans in CSAN demonstrates an early onset, with cutaneous manifestations frequently appearing within the first year of life and typically by age three to four years[1]. In a well-documented case of CSAN, acanthosis nigricans manifested by three months of age in flexural areas, particularly the neck, with progressive spread to involve the face, axillae, abdomen, back, chest, and extremities[1]. This very early onset distinguishes the acanthosis nigricans of CSAN from the adult-onset form typically associated with insulin resistance or malignancy, providing an important diagnostic clue to the syndromic nature of the condition. The cutaneous lesions are initially flat and velvety with darkened appearance, progressing to become palpable plaques with pronounced thickening and increased texture.

Additional cutaneous manifestations have been documented in CSAN patients beyond the classic acanthosis nigricans. These include melanotic nevi (benign pigmented moles), hypopigmented scars, sacral pits (small dimples in the sacral region), and verruca vulgaris (common warts)[1]. The occurrence of these varied cutaneous features emphasizes the broad effects of dysregulated FGFR3 signaling on epidermal and dermal development. Some patients experience pruritus (itching) and mild xerosis (dry skin) associated with the acanthosis nigricans, reflecting the compromised barrier function and altered stratum corneum composition[1].

The progression of craniosynostosis and associated complications continues throughout childhood and into adolescence if surgical interventions are not performed. Without surgical correction, premature suture fusion leads to progressive restriction of intracranial volume, elevated intracranial pressure, and potential complications including optic nerve atrophy and vision loss, developmental delays, and learning difficulties[17][33][36]. The upper airway obstruction resulting from mandibular prognathism and midface hypoplasia can cause sleep-disordered breathing, leading to nighttime oxygen desaturation and chronic carbon dioxide retention that further elevates intracranial pressure[33].

## Imaging and Histopathological Findings

Neuroimaging studies in CSAN patients reveal characteristic skeletal and soft tissue abnormalities. Computed tomography of the skull demonstrates premature fusion of cranial sutures, particularly involving the coronal sutures, with associated maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw), exophthalmos (forward protrusion of the eyeballs), and mandibular prognathism (forward protrusion of the lower jaw)[1]. The maxillary hypoplasia can be severe enough to cause functional problems with breathing and eating. Three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions provide detailed visualization of the craniofacial skeletal anatomy and help guide surgical planning. Brain imaging may reveal ventriculomegaly (enlarged ventricles), displacement of the cerebellar tonsils, descent of cerebellar structures into the foramen magnum, and evidence of elevated intracranial pressure[33]. Decreased cerebrospinal fluid spaces around the brain and a compressed appearance of the subarachnoid space indicate reduced intracranial compliance and elevated pressure[33][36].

Histological examination of acanthosis nigricans lesions reveals characteristic features distinct from other hyperkeratotic conditions. The epidermis demonstrates papillomatosis with finger-like projections of dermal papillae projecting deeply into the epidermis, accompanied by marked hyperkeratosis (thickening of the outermost layer of dead skin cells), and hyperpigmentation concentrated in the basal epidermal layer[3]. The dermal component shows dermal papillae with upward projections and an overlying epidermis that is thinned rather than thickened, a pattern sometimes called "reversed type II papillomatosis."[3] Importantly, the dermis typically lacks significant inflammatory infiltrate, distinguishing acanthosis nigricans from inflammatory dermatoses[3]. Immunohistochemical studies may reveal altered expression patterns of growth factors and their receptors, with enhanced FGFR3 expression in keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts compared to normal control skin[1].

## Molecular Diagnosis and Genetic Testing

Definitive diagnosis of CSAN requires genetic testing demonstrating the A391E mutation in the *FGFR3* gene. Nucleotide sequencing of exon 9 of the *FGFR3* gene, where the A391E mutation is located, reveals the pathogenic 1172C>A transversion[1]. The mutation can be detected through multiple molecular methods including Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing panels targeting known disease-causing variants, and whole exome or whole genome sequencing[1]. Genetic testing typically analyzes DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes, though direct analysis of affected skin tissue may reveal somatic variants that have arisen post-zygotically in individuals with segmental manifestations of CSAN.

The distinction between CSAN caused by FGFR3 mutations and classic Crouzon syndrome caused by FGFR2 mutations is clinically important. While both conditions cause craniosynostosis and craniofacial dysostosis, only CSAN includes the distinctive cutaneous finding of acanthosis nigricans and only CSAN results from FGFR3 mutations. Approximately 80% of classic Crouzon syndrome cases result from mutations in the *FGFR2* gene, particularly in the immunoglobulin-like domain III region[16][19]. The presence of acanthosis nigricans should prompt specifically targeting *FGFR3* exon 9 sequencing or, alternatively, panel-based sequencing of all four *FGFR* genes in patients with suspected FGFR-related craniosynostosis.

## Endocrine and Metabolic Abnormalities

While the primary manifestations of CSAN are skeletal and cutaneous, some patients exhibit abnormalities in endocrine and metabolic parameters. In documented cases, cortisol levels have been found to be lower than normal ranges, suggesting possible subtle hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction[1]. Conversely, other endocrine parameters including follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, testosterone, and prolactin have been documented as normal in affected individuals[1]. The significance of low cortisol levels in CSAN pathophysiology remains unclear and requires further investigation in larger patient cohorts to determine whether this represents a consistent feature or isolated finding.

## Complications and Long-term Sequelae

Untreated CSAN can result in multiple serious complications affecting quality of life and developmental outcomes. Elevated intracranial pressure represents the most significant potential complication, occurring in approximately two-thirds of patients with Crouzon syndrome and representing a high proportion of CSAN cases due to multisuture involvement[19][33]. Chronically elevated intracranial pressure can cause optic nerve atrophy through compression of the optic nerves where they pass through the optic canal in the sphenoid bone, leading to progressive visual impairment and potentially blindness if untreated[17][33][36]. Papilledema (swelling of the optic disc from increased intracranial pressure) is visible on ophthalmologic examination and indicates significant intracranial hypertension requiring urgent intervention[36].

Upper airway obstruction resulting from mandibular hypoplasia and midface retrusion can cause sleep-disordered breathing, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic hypoventilation[33]. During sleep, the abnormally positioned structures narrow the airway, causing episodes of apnea with oxygen desaturation and arousal[33]. Chronic intermittent hypoxemia and carbon dioxide retention contribute to elevated intracranial pressure and can cause pulmonary hypertension and right heart dysfunction in severe cases[33]. Additionally, the anatomic abnormalities can cause dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and feeding difficulties in infants, requiring close monitoring and sometimes tube feeding support.

Dental abnormalities are nearly universal in CSAN patients and include overcrowding of teeth, crossbite, anterior open bite, and high-arched palate resulting from the underlying maxillary hypoplasia and mandibular prognathism[13][22]. These dental and occlusal abnormalities require extensive orthodontic management and may necessitate orthognathic surgery to correct the underlying skeletal discrepancy.

Hearing loss occurs in a subset of CSAN patients, resulting from either conductive hearing loss due to middle ear abnormalities and narrow ear canals or from sensorineural hearing loss[13][22]. The anatomic abnormalities of the temporal bone can compress the middle ear structures or impair middle ear function through eustachian tube dysfunction.

Cognitive and developmental outcomes in CSAN are generally favorable compared to some other syndromic forms of craniosynostosis. Most CSAN patients have normal intelligence quotient, though subtle developmental delays may occur particularly if elevated intracranial pressure develops before surgical intervention[22][33]. Early diagnosis and timely surgical treatment to relieve intracranial hypertension and expand the skull vault are critical for preserving normal cognitive development[36].

## Surgical and Medical Management

The management of CSAN requires multidisciplinary input from pediatric neurosurgery, craniofacial/plastic surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and other specialists. The primary goal of surgical management is to expand the intracranial vault sufficiently to accommodate brain growth, relieve intracranial hypertension, and progressively reconstruct the skull and facial skeleton into more normal configuration[36].

Surgical intervention for craniosynostosis typically begins in infancy when the infant brain growth is maximal and surgical expandability is greatest. Various surgical techniques exist, including open surgical approaches with craniotomy and suturectomy, endoscopic-assisted approaches with gradual helmet remodeling, and distraction osteogenesis techniques[36]. The specific approach depends on the number of sutures involved, the severity of deformity, and institutional expertise. Single suture fusions may be managed with less extensive procedures, while multisuture involvement typically requires more comprehensive surgical approaches.

For acanthosis nigricans manifestations, topical treatments may provide symptomatic improvement. Keratolytic agents containing salicylic acid, urea, or alpha-hydroxy acids can help reduce the thickness of hyperkeratotic plaques[6]. Topical retinoids such as tretinoin or adapalene may improve the appearance through enhanced keratinocyte turnover and normalization of differentiation[6]. Procedural interventions including fractional carbon dioxide laser and chemical peels have been explored in small series with variable success[26]. However, unlike insulin resistance-associated acanthosis nigricans which may improve with weight loss and metabolic control, the hereditary form resulting from FGFR3 mutations typically persists and requires ongoing management strategies.

## Comparison with Other FGFR-Related Syndromes

CSAN represents one of several distinct syndromes caused by FGFR mutations that result in craniosynostosis and craniofacial dysostosis. Classic Crouzon syndrome, caused by FGFR2 mutations, produces similar craniofacial features including craniosynostosis, ocular hypertelorism, exophthalmos, beaked nose, midface hypoplasia, and mandibular prognathism, but lacks the distinctive acanthosis nigricans findings of CSAN and typically involves different mutation hotspots within the *FGFR2* gene[13][16][22]. Apert syndrome, also caused by FGFR2 mutations, shares the craniofacial features with Crouzon syndrome but additionally includes syndactyly (fusion of fingers and toes) and typically more severe intellectual disability[22]. Pfeiffer syndrome, another FGFR2-related condition, combines craniofacial features with digital abnormalities including broad big toes and thumbs. Muenke syndrome results from a specific FGFR3 mutation (P250R, distinct from the A391E mutation of CSAN) and causes coronal craniosynostosis with subtle hand and foot abnormalities and variable hearing loss[11][22].

The fact that different FGFR mutations produce distinct clinical syndromes reflects the specificity of mutation effects on receptor structure and function. The A391E mutation in FGFR3 transmembrane domain produces both craniosynostosis (like other FGFR mutations) and the distinctive acanthosis nigricans finding, suggesting that this particular mutation may affect FGFR3 signaling in a way that is particularly consequential for epidermal development compared to other FGFR mutations that primarily cause craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities.

## Current Understanding of Pathophysiological Mechanisms and Remaining Questions

Significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying CSAN, particularly through characterization of the A391E mutation's effects on FGFR3 activation and signaling[2][8]. The identification of both enhanced basal dimerization and increased phosphorylation efficiency as consequences of the mutation explains how this single amino acid change produces such substantial effects on receptor activation across a range of ligand concentrations[2][8]. The recognition that dysregulated FGFR signaling promotes osteogenic differentiation in cranial sutures while suppressing chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plate exemplifies the context-dependent nature of growth factor signaling in different developmental compartments[14][15][27][40].

However, several important questions remain regarding CSAN pathophysiology. First, while the skeletal manifestations of CSAN are well-explained by enhanced FGFR3 signaling in osteoprogenitors, the specific mechanisms by which the A391E mutation produces acanthosis nigricans remain incompletely characterized. The mutation itself does not fundamentally alter which ligands can bind FGFR3 or which downstream pathways are activated compared to wild-type receptors; rather, it amplifies the magnitude and baseline level of signaling. Whether this amplification is sufficient to produce acanthosis nigricans, or whether additional genetic or environmental factors contribute to the cutaneous phenotype, deserves investigation. Second, the tissue specificity of the cutaneous manifestations—why acanthosis nigricans appears predominantly in flexural areas rather than involving the entire integument—is incompletely understood and likely involves both local mechanical factors and tissue-specific gene expression patterns. Third, the temporal coordination of skeletal and cutaneous manifestations and why both emerge during infancy rather than later in development remains unclear and may relate to the developmental windows during which sutures are forming and epidermal differentiation is being established.

## Clinical and Research Implications

Understanding the pathophysiology of CSAN has important implications for clinical practice and future research directions. The definitive diagnosis of CSAN through *FGFR3* mutation testing is increasingly accessible and should be pursued in infants with craniosynostosis combined with characteristic cutaneous findings, given the distinct management implications compared to classic Crouzon syndrome. Early identification of CSAN in affected families through genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis enables early intervention and optimal outcomes. The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and high penetrance of CSAN mean that offspring of affected parents have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation, and genetic counseling regarding recurrence risks is appropriate.

From a therapeutic standpoint, the molecular understanding of CSAN pathophysiology opens potential avenues for targeted interventions beyond the current standard surgical and symptomatic approaches. FGFR inhibitors have been developed for cancer treatment and represent potential therapeutic agents for FGFR-related diseases, though their systemic effects on normal FGFR signaling and developmental processes would require careful evaluation[50]. Selective inhibition of specific downstream pathways, such as MEK inhibitors targeting the ERK1/2 cascade or PI3K inhibitors, might theoretically reduce pathological osteogenesis while preserving necessary physiologic functions, though this would require rigorous preclinical testing before clinical application. Additionally, understanding the role of negative feedback mechanisms in limiting FGFR3 signaling, such as the CBL-mediated ubiquitination pathway[25][57], might inform strategies to enhance endogenous negative regulation of the mutant receptor.

The study of CSAN exemplifies how a single point mutation can have profound consequences across multiple organ systems through its effects on fundamental growth factor signaling pathways. The skeletal and cutaneous manifestations, while clinically distinct, both arise from dysregulated FGFR3 signaling, highlighting the importance of considering pleiotropic effects of mutations on multiple tissues and developmental processes. Further research into the tissue-specific consequences of FGFR3 dysregulation and the molecular mechanisms linking the A391E mutation to acanthosis nigricans development will enhance understanding of both the syndrome itself and the broader roles of FGFR signaling in development and disease.

## Conclusion

Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans represents a rare but instructive genetic disorder combining premature fusion of cranial sutures with characteristic cutaneous hyperkeratotic plaques resulting from a single point mutation (1172C>A, p.Ala391Glu) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene. The A391E substitution in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3 produces a gain-of-function receptor exhibiting both enhanced ligand-independent dimerization and increased efficiency of kinase domain autophosphorylation, resulting in amplified signaling through RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, STAT, and other downstream cascades[1][2][8]. In skeletal tissues, dysregulated FGFR3 signaling promotes premature and excessive osteogenic differentiation of cranial suture mesenchymal cells through ERK1/2-mediated stabilization of Runx2, suppression of osteogenesis inhibitors like Twist1, and enhanced expression of bone morphogenetic proteins[9][14][40][41]. These coordinated effects drive premature suture fusion, restrict skull vault expansion, and lead to the characteristic craniofacial dysmorphology and potential complications of elevated intracranial pressure that define the skeletal manifestations of CSAN.

In epidermal tissues, the same dysregulated FGFR3 signaling produces enhanced keratinocyte proliferation and impaired terminal differentiation through ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT pathway activation, resulting in accumulation of hyperkeratotic material and development of the velvety, hyperpigmented plaques characteristic of acanthosis nigricans[1][2][3]. The preferential involvement of flexural areas reflects the local microenvironment and tissue-specific factors that amplify the proliferative effects of dysregulated FGFR signaling. Both skeletal and cutaneous manifestations typically emerge during infancy and early childhood, with early diagnosis through genetic testing and multidisciplinary management critical for optimizing long-term outcomes.

The pathophysiology of CSAN exemplifies fundamental principles of developmental biology and growth factor signaling, demonstrating how disruption of a single receptor at the molecular level propagates through multiple cellular pathways and tissues to produce complex clinical syndrome. Further research into tissue-specific responses to dysregulated FGFR signaling, the molecular mechanisms linking the A391E mutation to cutaneous manifestations, and development of targeted therapeutic approaches hold promise for improving outcomes in CSAN and advancing the broader understanding of FGFR-related disease pathophysiology.
