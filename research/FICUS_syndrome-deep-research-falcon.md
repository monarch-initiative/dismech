Disease Pathophysiology Research Template

Target Disease
- Disease Name: FICUS syndrome (Family Intensive Care Unit Syndrome)
- MONDO ID: Not identified in current biomedical ontologies; no entry found in standard disease catalogs, and the literature emphasizes the term lacks a universal definition and standardized measurement (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 1-2, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 7-8).
- Category: Psychosocial/health-services–related syndrome affecting family members of ICU patients; not a genetic disorder. There is no molecular or genetic pathophysiology described in the peer‑reviewed literature (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 2-3, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 5-6, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 7-8).

Pathophysiology description
Current understanding frames FICUS as a multidimensional syndrome comprising psychological, physical, and social impairments in family members during and after a loved one’s ICU admission. It overlaps conceptually with Post-Intensive Care Syndrome–Family (PICS‑F). There is no established molecular or cellular mechanism; rather, observed phenomena reflect stress-related psychological responses, sleep disruption, decision burden, and care-process factors within ICU settings (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 3-4, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3).

- Definitional status: “There is no universal definition for the term ‘FICUS’ in the research literature,” and specialized measurement tools are lacking (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 1-2, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 7-8).
- Symptom domains: Anxiety, depression, post‑traumatic stress symptoms, complicated grief, sleep disorders, stress, fatigue; cognitive and decision‑making difficulties are described (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 3-4, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 6-7).
- Process factors: Family exposure to patient delirium, high illness severity, invasive devices, and acute-onset illness are associated with higher symptom burden; these are context/care-process correlates, not molecular pathways (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3; Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-1769933) (kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3, gurbuz2023anxietyanddepression pages 2-3).

Core Pathophysiology
- Primary mechanisms: psychosocial stress responses to critical illness of a loved one; sleep disruption; information needs and communication challenges; surrogate decision-making load; exposure to distressing ICU phenomena (e.g., delirium) (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 5-6, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 6-7, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3).
- Dysregulated “pathways”: No canonical molecular pathways identified; rather, validated psychological constructs (anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms) measured with HADS, IES, and related instruments are used to characterize burden (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3; Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-1769933) (kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3, gurbuz2023anxietyanddepression pages 2-3).
- Affected cellular processes: Not applicable; FICUS is not defined by cellular pathobiology (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 7-8).

Key Molecular Players
- Genes/Proteins (HGNC): None implicated; no genetic etiology has been reported (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 7-8).
- Chemical Entities (ChEBI): Not applicable to etiology or treatment; research focuses on nonpharmacologic, family‑support interventions (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-024-08351-y) (felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 1-2, felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 2-3, felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 10-11).
- Cell Types (CL): Not applicable.
- Anatomical Locations (UBERON): Not applicable.

Biological Processes (for GO annotation)
Because FICUS is not a biological disease entity with molecular pathogenesis, GO biological process annotations are not appropriate. Published work operationalizes FICUS/PICS‑F using psychological symptom instruments (e.g., HADS, IES) rather than cellular or molecular processes (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3; Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 7-8).

Cellular Components
Not applicable; there are no established cellular-localization mechanisms for FICUS (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 7-8).

Disease Progression
- Initial trigger: ICU admission of a loved one; family exposure to high acuity care, uncertainty, and potential end-of-life decisions (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 3-4, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 6-7).
- Early phase: Elevated anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, acute stress within 48 hours to days of ICU admission; higher in families of delirious patients (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3).
- Subacute phase: Symptoms may persist at 30 days; higher PTSD scores have been observed in families of patients with delirium compared with non-delirium cohorts (mean PTSD score ~11.0 vs ~6.4 at day 30; p<0.001) (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2).
- Long-term phase: A substantial proportion of family members report persistent psychological symptoms and QoL impairments at 3–12 months after ICU discharge, with dyadic associations to the survivor’s symptoms (Jan 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-025-01420-8) (rai2025psychologicalsymptomsquality pages 1-2).

Phenotypic Manifestations
- Clinical phenotypes (PICS‑F domain): Anxiety (HADS), depression (HADS), PTSD symptoms (IES/PTSD‑C), sleep disturbance, fatigue, impaired decision-making; prevalence ranges reported include anxiety up to ~70%, depression ~35–70%, and PTSD ~33–54%, with variability across settings and measures (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 3-4).
- 2023–2024 quantitative data:
  - 2023 prospective cohort (Turkey): 84 families; anxiety symptoms in 52.4% and depression in 67.9%; higher odds with nasogastric tube presence and acute illness; greater depression when the patient died in ICU (Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-1769933) (gurbuz2023anxietyanddepression pages 2-3).
  - 2024 prospective study (Poland): At 30 days, families of delirious patients had higher PTSD scores (IES total; p=0.001) and higher intrusion/hyperarousal than controls; assessments at 48 h and 30 days (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2).
  - 2025 multicenter cohort (Australia): Approximately one‑third of family members had persistent psychological symptoms and QoL problems at 12 months; strong dyadic associations with patient symptoms (Jan 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-025-01420-8) (rai2025psychologicalsymptomsquality pages 1-2).

Predictors and Correlates
- Demographic/contextual: Female gender, low education, having a critically ill spouse/close relationship, lower resources/support, information deficits, younger age; care-process factors (acute onset illness, higher severity, invasive devices, delirium exposure) (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19; Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-1769933; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 6-7, gurbuz2023anxietyanddepression pages 2-3, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3).
- Baseline mental health: Prior anxiety/depression or acute stress increases risk (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 3-4).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritized 2023–2024)
- FICUS Trial (implementation and SAP): A multicomponent, nurse‑led interprofessional family support intervention is being evaluated in a cluster‑randomized superiority trial across 16 ICUs (8 per arm). Primary outcome is family satisfaction with ICU care (FS‑ICU‑24R) at discharge; secondary outcomes include quality of communication (QQPPI‑14), nurse support (ICE‑FPSQ‑14), and longitudinal HADS and IES measures at 3, 6, and 12 months. Recruitment completed January 2024; final follow‑up early 2025. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05280691; registered Feb 20, 2022). Statistical analysis plan specifies LMMs with cluster random effects and visit×treatment interactions; adherence requires ≥5 intervention contacts covering all core components (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-024-08351-y) (felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 1-2, felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 2-3, felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 7-9, felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 10-11).
- Observational evidence 2023–2024: Prospective studies quantify high anxiety/depression burdens and show increased PTSD symptoms among families of delirious patients; qualitative work highlights unmet needs and the importance of communication and support (Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-1769933; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (gurbuz2023anxietyanddepression pages 2-3, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- ICU family‑support programs: The FICUS multicomponent intervention operationalizes early engagement, psycho‑educational/relationship‑focused conversations, and structured interprofessional communication/shared decision-making, led by designated family nurses—now being implemented in a multicenter trial with tailored implementation strategies reported in 2023 (Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-023-10285-1) (felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 2-3, felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 11-12).
- Routine assessment: Use of HADS, IES, and PTSD‑related scales to screen family members for distress within 48 h of ICU admission and in follow‑up, particularly when patients have delirium (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Integrative review: Emphasizes lack of universal definition, the breadth of symptom domains, and need for standardized tools and interventions; positions FICUS within a broader PICS‑F framework and calls for time‑framed prevention and management plans (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 5-6, moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 7-8).
- Contemporary prospective studies with senior PICS/PICS‑F experts: The 2024 Scientific Reports study (co‑authored by E. Wesley Ely) underscores that family members have substantial early and persistent PTSD/anxiety/depression burdens and argues for proactive support strategies (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Anxiety/depression prevalence: 52.4% anxiety and 67.9% depression among family members in a 2023 prospective cohort; odds of anxiety/depression elevated with nasogastric tube and acute illness; higher depression if the patient died in ICU (Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-1769933) (gurbuz2023anxietyanddepression pages 2-3).
- PTSD symptom burden: Mean IES‑PTSD higher in families of delirious vs non‑delirious patients at 30 days (11.02 vs 6.42; p<0.001); increases in intrusion and hyperarousal domains observed (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2).
- Long‑term outcomes: Nearly one‑third of family members report persistent psychological symptoms and QoL impairments at 12 months; strong dyadic associations with survivor symptoms (Jan 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-025-01420-8) (rai2025psychologicalsymptomsquality pages 1-2).

Conclusion
FICUS syndrome, as used in recent literature, is a psychosocial syndrome affecting families of ICU patients, not a genetic or molecularly defined disease. Mechanistic discussion should focus on psychological stress, communication/decision challenges, and care-process exposures such as delirium, rather than molecular pathways. Contemporary research emphasizes standardized assessment, targeted family-support interventions (e.g., the ongoing FICUS trial), and longitudinal monitoring of anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, and QoL. No MONDO/OMIM/Orphanet entries or gene/protein/cellular mechanisms are currently supported by the evidence base (Sep 2020; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_243_19; Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-024-08351-y; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53968-3) (moradian2020familyintensivecare pages 7-8, felten2024multicomponentfamilysupport pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 1-2, kotfis2024thespectrumof pages 2-3).
