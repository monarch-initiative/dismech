# Pathophysiology of Malnutrition-Related Diabetes Mellitus (MRDM)

## Core Pathophysiological Mechanisms

**Malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus (MRDM)** – recently termed **“Type 5 diabetes”** – is an atypical form of diabetes driven by chronic undernutrition and not by autoimmunity or obesity. Prolonged nutritional deficiency (especially protein-calorie malnutrition in early life) leads to impaired pancreatic development and β-cell function ([idf.org](https://idf.org/about-diabetes/types-of-diabetes/type-5-diabetes/#:~:text=Type%205%20diabetes%20results%20from,due%20to%20underdeveloped%20pancreatic%20tissue)). The undernourished pancreas produces insufficient insulin, causing hyperglycemia despite patients often being young and thin. Unlike type 1 diabetes (autoimmune β-cell destruction) or type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance), MRDM is characterized by a **non-autoimmune insulin deficiency** due to an **underdeveloped or damaged pancreas** ([idf.org](https://idf.org/about-diabetes/types-of-diabetes/type-5-diabetes/#:~:text=Type%205%20diabetes%20results%20from,due%20to%20underdeveloped%20pancreatic%20tissue)). In MRDM, the primary defect is a reduction in functional β-cell mass and insulin secretory capacity caused by malnutrition-induced pancreatic atrophy or injury. 

A hallmark is that patients have **low circulating insulin and C-peptide levels** (reflecting β-cell impairment) but retain relatively normal insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=1%20,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)). This unique combination produces a distinct clinical phenotype: **lean, insulin-deficient diabetes without significant insulin resistance** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=1%20,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)). Notably, MRDM patients are often **“ketosis-resistant”**, meaning they rarely develop diabetic ketoacidosis even when insulin is very low ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=,malnutrition%2C%20a%20high%20dose%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=characterized%20by%20a%20socioeconomic%20setting,dysfunction%20and%20relative%20resistance%20to)). This is because some endogenous insulin production persists and possibly because malnutrition and pancreatic damage blunt counter-regulatory ketogenesis (e.g. via reduced glucagon output) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin%20to%20control%20the%20hyperglycemia%2C,the%20absence%20of%20clinical%20and)). As a result, MRDM typically presents as chronic hyperglycemia with polyuria and weight loss, **but without ketoacidotic crises** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=characterized%20by%20a%20socioeconomic%20setting,dysfunction%20and%20relative%20resistance%20to)).

Two subtypes of MRDM were recognized in early classifications ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=Diabetes%20Mellitus%20,as%20a%20possible%20factor%20in)):

- **Fibrocalculous Pancreatic Diabetes (FCPD)** – Diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic fibrosis and calcifications, often associated with dietary toxins and malnutrition. Recurrent pancreatitis (e.g. due to cassava toxicity or micronutrient deficiencies) leads to destruction of both exocrine and endocrine pancreas, causing insulinopenia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=Cassava%2C%20or%20tapioca%2C%20is%20widely,cassava%20consumption%20and%20the%20risk)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=associated%20diabetes%20%2841%20%29,the%20strength%20of%20this%20association)). These patients often have pancreatic calcifications and exocrine insufficiency in addition to diabetes.  
- **Protein-Deficient (Malnutrition-Modulated) Diabetes (PDDM/MMDM)** – Diabetes that develops in chronically undernourished individuals without obvious pancreatitis. Severe protein-calorie malnutrition during childhood and adolescence leads to **stunted pancreatic islet development and β-cell dysfunction**, reducing insulin secretory capacity ([idf.org](https://idf.org/about-diabetes/types-of-diabetes/type-5-diabetes/#:~:text=Type%205%20diabetes%20results%20from,due%20to%20underdeveloped%20pancreatic%20tissue)). This subtype – historically called “tropical diabetes” – occurs in young, underweight individuals with no evidence of pancreatic calcification ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin%20for%20prolonged%20periods.,dysfunction%20and%20relative%20resistance%20to)). 

Despite differing etiologies, both subtypes share the core pathophysiology of **relative insulin deficiency** in the context of malnutrition. Hyperglycemia arises primarily from inadequate insulin-mediated glucose uptake and unopposed hepatic glucose output. Compensatory mechanisms (e.g. upregulation of insulin sensitivity in muscles, increased peripheral glucose uptake) partially mitigate glycemia, which is why patients are often extremely insulin-sensitive clinically ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=1%20,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)). **Autoimmune β-cell destruction is generally absent** in true MRDM cases, although malnutrition may modulate immune responses (see below). In summary, chronic undernutrition injures the pancreatic islets – through direct trophic effects, increased vulnerability to toxins, and possibly epigenetic programming – resulting in a diabetes phenotype characterized by **low insulin levels, preserved insulin action, and unusual resistance to ketosis** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=undernutrition%20show%20some%20unique%20features,is%20independently%20associated%20with%20metabolic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=characterized%20by%20a%20socioeconomic%20setting,dysfunction%20and%20relative%20resistance%20to)).

## Key Molecular and Cellular Players

### Genetic and Protein Factors  
- **Insulin (INS)** – *Insulin* is the central hormone deficient in MRDM. Insufficient production of insulin by pancreatic β-cells leads to hyperglycemia and the clinical diabetes phenotype ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=undernutrition%20show%20some%20unique%20features,is%20independently%20associated%20with%20metabolic)). Low fasting C-peptide levels in MRDM patients confirm reduced endogenous insulin secretion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=undernutrition%20show%20some%20unique%20features,is%20independently%20associated%20with%20metabolic)). Unlike type 1 diabetes, MRDM is not caused by autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing cells, and patients typically lack anti-insulin or islet cell autoantibodies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=led%20by%20Meredith%20Hawkins%2C%20who,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)). Instead, the **INS gene product (insulin protein)** is under-produced due to β-cell dysfunction from malnutrition. This impaired insulin secretion (GO:0030073) is the cornerstone molecular defect driving MRDM’s pathophysiology.  

- **Pancreatic β-cell function genes** – Malnutrition can downregulate genes involved in β-cell survival and insulin synthesis. For instance, chronic protein deficiency may affect transcription factors like *PDX1* (which governs β-cell development and insulin gene expression) and other islet-specific genes, although direct human data are limited. There is evidence that early-life undernutrition causes epigenetic changes that **permanently reduce β-cell mass or responsiveness** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=be%20involved%20in%20the%20pathophysiology,associated%20diabetes)). In animal models, protein-calorie malnutrition impairs pancreatic islet development (GO:0031016) resulting in fewer insulin-producing cells. Human MRDM patients have been noted to have small pancreatic size on imaging (pancreatic atrophy), implying reduced endocrine tissue. **The net effect is inadequate expression of insulin and related genes**, and a pancreas less able to meet metabolic demands.

- **HLA genes and autoimmunity** – While not a primary driver, genetic studies indicate some MRDM patients have immunogenetic overlaps with type 1 diabetes. **HLA class II alleles** associated with autoimmunity (e.g. **HLA-DR3-DQ2 haplotype**) are found in a subset of malnutrition-modulated diabetes patients ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12021094/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20HLA%2C%20a,indicate%20the%20possibility%20that%20MMDM)). Importantly, these patients sometimes test positive for islet autoantibodies (such as GAD65 autoantibodies) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12021094/#:~:text=eastern%20Indians%20are%20associated%20with,prone%20individuals.%20The%20association%20of)), suggesting a slow-onset autoimmune component in addition to malnutrition. One study in India found that **MRDM cases positive for GAD65 antibodies and HLA-DR3/DQ2 likely represent an autoimmune etiology “masked” by malnutrition**, whereas autoantibody-negative cases (often carrying HLA-DR7-DQ2) appear truly non-autoimmune ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12021094/#:~:text=eastern%20Indians%20are%20associated%20with,prone%20individuals.%20The%20association%20of)). This implies that malnutrition might *delay or modulate autoimmune diabetes* in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to an atypical presentation. Overall, **classic autoimmune genes (HLA, etc.) are not consistently involved** in MRDM, but certain genotypes (e.g. HLA-DR3) may overlap in some patients, indicating heterogeneity in molecular drivers ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12021094/#:~:text=eastern%20Indians%20are%20associated%20with,prone%20individuals.%20The%20association%20of)).

- **Pancreatic digestive enzyme genes (Protease inhibitors)** – In fibrocalculous MRDM, genetic factors that predispose to pancreatitis are important. A prominent example is the **SPINK1 gene** (Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal Type 1), which encodes a trypsin inhibitor crucial for protecting the pancreas from autodigestion. Mutations in *SPINK1* (such as the N34S variant) are **significantly associated with fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes**, found in ~33% of FCPD patients in South Asia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC378551/#:~:text=associated%20with%20susceptibility%20to%20FCPD,of%20180%20subjects%20with%20FCPD)). The SPINK1 N34S mutant impairs the regulation of trypsin, promoting recurrent pancreatic inflammation and calcification ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC378551/#:~:text=to%20chronic%20pancreatitis,to%20determine%20whether%20N34S%20was)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC378551/#:~:text=associated%20with%20susceptibility%20to%20FCPD,of%20180%20subjects%20with%20FCPD)). Thus, in genetically susceptible malnourished individuals, pancreatitis-prone genes like *SPINK1* and possibly *CFTR* or *PRSS1* (involved in cystic fibrosis and trypsin activation) can lead to chronic pancreatitis and subsequent diabetes. These genes are **not causes of MRDM per se**, but they facilitate the pancreatogenic pathway when combined with undernutrition and dietary factors.

- **Counterregulatory hormone levels** – MRDM’s ketosis-resistant nature implicates abnormalities in hormones like glucagon. In chronic pancreatitis-associated MRDM, damage extends to α-cells, resulting in deficient **glucagon (GCG)** secretion. Low glucagon undermines hepatic ketone production, helping explain why even severe insulin lack does not trigger ketoacidosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin%20to%20control%20the%20hyperglycemia%2C,the%20absence%20of%20clinical%20and)). Studies in Ethiopian patients noted blunted glucagon output alongside low C-peptide ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12021094/#:~:text=eastern%20Indians%20are%20associated%20with,prone%20individuals.%20The%20association%20of)), consistent with a combined endocrine insufficiency. Other hormones may also be altered: malnourished individuals often have elevated circulating cortisol and growth hormone levels (reflecting stress and protein catabolism), which can aggravate hyperglycemia. Simultaneously, **adipokines** like leptin are very low (due to minimal adipose stores), which may increase appetite but also *enhance insulin sensitivity* (leptin deficiency reduces insulin resistance). High adiponectin is often seen in cachectic patients, also contributing to preserved insulin action. While these hormone changes are secondary, they influence the metabolic balance – e.g. high cortisol can raise blood glucose, but high adiponectin and low leptin improve muscle glucose uptake. The net effect in MRDM is a *unique endocrine milieu*: **profound insulinopenia** with mild counterregulatory hormone activity, yielding hyperglycemia without the full catabolic ketosis seen in uncontrolled type 1 DM.

### Relevant Metabolites and Chemical Factors  
- **Glucose (CHEBI:17234)** – Elevated blood glucose is the direct metabolic consequence of MRDM due to inadequate insulin-mediated uptake. Fasting hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance develop as insulin levels fall. Postprandial glucose spikes are pronounced because the malnourished muscle and liver, though insulin-sensitive, cannot clear the excess glucose without sufficient insulin. Chronic hyperglycemia in turn causes glucose to spill into urine (glycosuria) and osmotic diuresis (polyuria), exacerbating nutrient losses and weight loss (worsening malnutrition in a vicious cycle).

- **Ketone bodies** – In typical insulin-dependent diabetes, lack of insulin leads to excess fatty acid oxidation and **ketone body** (CHEBI:35184) production, causing ketoacidosis. In MRDM, however, ketogenesis is minimal (“ketosis-resistant diabetes” ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=,as%20a%20possible%20factor%20in)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=characterized%20by%20a%20socioeconomic%20setting,dysfunction%20and%20relative%20resistance%20to))). Patients often have *undetectable or low ketones* even with very high blood glucose. This is partly because residual insulin suppresses lipolysis, and partly because malnutrition may limit substrates and enzymes required for ketone production (e.g. depleted adipose tissue and possibly carnitine or other cofactors). **Glucagon deficiency** (in fibrocalculous cases) also restrains hepatic ketogenesis. Thus, the usual metabolic signature of complete insulin lack (high free fatty acids and ketones) is blunted in MRDM. Clinically, these patients can have blood glucose >300 mg/dL without acidotic ketosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin%20to%20control%20the%20hyperglycemia%2C,the%20absence%20of%20clinical%20and)) – an important distinguishing feature.

- **Protein and amino acids** – Chronic protein deficiency is a key factor in MRDM pathogenesis. Low dietary protein impairs insulin synthesis (as insulin is a protein hormone) and also compromises the body’s ability to detoxify certain chemicals. For example, **sulfur-containing amino acids** (methionine, cysteine) are needed to neutralize cyanide from cassava. In protein-malnourished diets, **amino acid pools are depleted**, leading to muscle wasting and diminished gluconeogenic substrate. This contributes to reduced lean mass (less glycogen storage capacity) and may directly stunt pancreatic protein synthesis (e.g. less proinsulin production). Additionally, hypoalbuminemia from malnutrition can affect drug and hormone transport. Overall, severe protein-calorie malnutrition alters numerous metabolic pathways (GO:0006082 carbohydrate metabolism; GO:0006520 cellular amino acid metabolism), setting the stage for diabetes when insulin output can no longer meet even the reduced metabolic demands.

- **Dietary toxins (Cassava cyanogens)** – Environmental chemicals play a notable role in MRDM, especially the fibrocalculous subtype. **Cassava (Manihot esculenta)**, a staple tuber in many tropical regions, contains cyanogenic glycosides like *linamarin* that release **hydrogen cyanide (HCN)** on ingestion. Chronic high cassava intake, particularly in the context of low-protein diets, has been **postulated to increase the risk of pancreatitis and MRDM** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=Cassava%2C%20or%20tapioca%2C%20is%20widely,cassava%20consumption%20and%20the%20risk)). The cyanide exposure and relative protein deficiency (impairing detoxification) may cause repeated subclinical pancreatic injury. Epidemiologic studies show a correlation: populations relying on cassava as a major food have a higher prevalence of malnutrition-associated diabetes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=increase%20the%20risk%20of%20diabetes,associated%20diabetes%2C%20more%20research)). In rats, long-term tapioca (cassava) feeding produced a 3-fold increase in diabetes incidence ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=increase%20the%20risk%20of%20diabetes,the%20strength%20of%20this%20association)). However, some studies failed to find a clear link, so the cassava-diabetes connection remains under investigation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=associated%20diabetes%20%2841%20%29,the%20strength%20of%20this%20association)). Other toxins have also been considered: for example, chronic alcohol use (in some malnourished individuals) or various food contaminants could contribute to pancreatic damage. In essence, **dietary toxins plus malnutrition synergize to injure the pancreas**, evidenced by activation of detox enzymes like cytochrome P450 in undernourished diabetics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=Cytochrome%20P450%20activates%20a%20number,are%20induced%20in%20human%20islets)). These chemical stressors further compromise β-cell survival and insulin secretion capacity.

- **Inflammatory cytokines** – Infections and gut microbiota changes in malnutrition can lead to elevated cytokines (like TNF-α, IL-6) that cause peripheral insulin resistance and β-cell stress. While MRDM patients are generally insulin-sensitive, episodes of infection (e.g. tuberculosis, chronic parasitic diseases common in poverty settings) can transiently raise cytokine levels and blood sugar. Chronic inflammation from ongoing infections or intestinal dysbiosis might also directly impair insulin signaling (GO:0032868 response to insulin) or induce insulin resistance in the liver. Notably, the **confounding role of infections** in malnourished diabetes has been highlighted – making it difficult to isolate malnutrition’s direct effect ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=the%20variants%20of%20the%20classical,these%20controversies%2C%20further%20research%20is)). For example, tuberculosis can both cause weight loss and provoke hyperglycemia via stress hormones. Therefore, cytokine-mediated effects are considered a modifying factor: malnutrition sets the stage, and concurrent infections/inflammation can accelerate the progression to overt diabetes or worsen glycemic control.

### Affected Cell Types, Tissues, and Organ Systems  
- **Pancreatic β-cells (CL:0000169)** – These insulin-secreting cells in the islets of Langerhans are the primary cells affected. MRDM patients have a deficiency of functional β-cells due to nutritional atrophy or pancreatitis. Histologically, PDDM cases show reduced islet size and insulin-positive cell mass. In FCPD, fibrotic destruction of pancreatic tissue leads to loss of both β-cells and α-cells. The **pancreatic islets (UBERON:0001267)** are thus the central site of pathology, with β-cell dysfunction resulting in insufficient insulin output. Key cellular processes like insulin gene expression, granule packaging, and glucose-stimulated insulin release are impaired in these cells (leading to the low C-peptide and insulin levels observed ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=undernutrition%20show%20some%20unique%20features,is%20independently%20associated%20with%20metabolic))). 

- **Pancreatic α-cells (glucagon-producing cells)** – Especially in fibrocalculous diabetes, α-cells in the islets are also damaged. The loss of α-cell function contributes to an inadequate glucagon response. Consequently, MRDM patients often have *blunted hepatic glucose release and ketone production*, as noted earlier. Thus, **islet α and β cells** are both victims of malnutrition’s impact: β-cell loss causes diabetes, and α-cell loss explains some “atypical” features (like absence of ketosis and even risk of hypoglycemia during treatment due to lack of glucagon). 

- **Exocrine pancreatic acinar cells (CL:0002064)** – In FCPD, the **pancreatic acinar tissue (UBERON:0001964)** undergoes chronic inflammation and calcification. These enzyme-producing cells are replaced by fibrous tissue and calcium deposits, which is why abdominal pain and malabsorption (steatorrhea) can accompany the diabetes. Pancreatic acinar destruction indirectly worsens nutrient status (exocrine insufficiency -> maldigestion -> worse malnutrition), creating a vicious cycle. Additionally, exocrine dysfunction might affect islet cells via loss of locally produced growth factors. Autopsy studies in tropical calcific diabetes show a shrunken, fibrotic pancreas peppered with stones, confirming that **acinar cell injury** is a major pathology in that subtype.

- **Liver and skeletal muscle** – These insulin target tissues play a role in the phenotype of MRDM. **Skeletal muscle (UBERON:0001134)** is often severely reduced in mass (cachexia) due to malnutrition, but the muscle that remains tends to be highly insulin-sensitive. Glucose uptake by muscle is thus limited more by low insulin supply than by insulin resistance. The **liver (UBERON:0002107)**, in the absence of normal insulin levels, overproduces glucose (gluconeogenesis stays high), contributing to fasting hyperglycemia. Yet, because glucagon levels are low (especially in fibrocalculous cases), hepatic glucose output and ketogenesis are not as extreme as in type 1 diabetes. The liver’s detox systems (e.g. cytochrome P450 enzymes) may be upregulated due to chronic exposure to dietary toxins in malnourished individuals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=Cytochrome%20P450%20activates%20a%20number,are%20induced%20in%20human%20islets)). Also, deficiencies in hepatic micronutrients (like zinc or chromium) might impair insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. In summary, while the primary lesion is in the pancreas, **MRDM entails whole-body metabolic disturbances**: the liver, muscles, and fat cells respond in unique ways to the low-insulin, low-nutrient environment.

- **Adipose tissue** – MRDM patients have very little **adipose tissue (UBERON:0002385)** due to longstanding caloric deficit. Adipocytes in these patients release lower levels of free fatty acids, which actually reduces lipotoxicity and improves insulin sensitivity. However, the lack of fat reserves means they cannot buffer fluctuations in energy supply, and during illness they quickly deplete glucose and protein stores. Low leptin from adipose tissue signals starvation mode, which may increase adrenal corticosteroids and exacerbate hyperglycemia. Brown adipose and other thermogenic tissues are also reduced, affecting energy expenditure. Adipose tissue is thus both a victim and a contributor: malnutrition shrinks fat depots (leading to certain hormonal changes), and the near-absence of adiposity is part of why these patients remain insulin-sensitive despite diabetes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=1%20,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)).

- **Immune cells** – Chronic undernutrition causes thymic atrophy and impaired cell-mediated immunity. While not a “cell type” involved in causing MRDM, this immunosuppression may allow low-grade infections to persist and could attenuate autoimmune processes. Some researchers speculate that malnutrition-induced T-cell anergy might *slow down autoimmune β-cell destruction* in predisposed individuals ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12021094/#:~:text=eastern%20Indians%20are%20associated%20with,prone%20individuals.%20The%20association%20of)), leading to a form of slowly progressive diabetes that initially appears non-autoimmune. Additionally, pancreatic histology in malnutrition-diabetes typically does **not** show the lymphocytic insulitis seen in type 1 DM, consistent with a lack of aggressive immune attack. Immune cells are thus more bystanders modulated by malnutrition rather than active drivers in primary MRDM – except in overlap cases where malnutrition coexists with autoimmunity.

## Disrupted Biological Processes (GO Annotations)

Multiple biological processes are perturbed in MRDM, reflecting the complex pathophysiology:

- **Insulin secretion (GO:0030073)** – The fundamental defect is in the process of insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic β-cells. Chronic undernutrition impairs glucose-induced insulin secretion, due to both β-cell loss and dysfunction. Key steps – proinsulin biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, granule packaging, and exocytosis – are downregulated. MRDM patients show an absence of the first-phase insulin response and an attenuated second-phase response to glucose ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=1%20,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)). The GO process “regulation of insulin secretion” is abnormally low in these individuals, leading to inadequate insulin available for metabolic needs.

- **Pancreas development (GO:0031016)** – In those affected from an early age, malnutrition disrupts normal pancreatic growth and islet neogenesis. Childhood undernutrition is hypothesized to cause permanent reductions in islet cell numbers (a form of developmental programming) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=be%20involved%20in%20the%20pathophysiology,associated%20diabetes)). The biological process of pancreatic organ development and endocrine cell differentiation is thus incomplete, leaving a smaller reserve of β-cells (sometimes termed “pancreatic hypoplasia due to malnutrition”). This early insult translates into vulnerability for diabetes in adolescence or adulthood, especially if nutritional stress continues.

- **Glucose homeostasis (GO:0042593)** – MRDM is fundamentally a failure of normal glucose homeostasis. The finely tuned balance of hepatic glucose production, peripheral uptake, and hormonal regulation is upset. With insufficient insulin, hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis go unchecked (especially in the overnight fast), raising blood glucose. Meanwhile, glucose uptake into muscle and fat (GO:0042886, glucose transport) is suboptimal even though insulin sensitivity is high – simply because insulin levels are too low. The result is chronic hyperglycemia. Unlike type 2 diabetes, **insulin-mediated signaling (GO:0032868)** in muscle cells is not resistant; rather, it’s the *absolute lack* of insulin that hinders glucose utilization. When insulin is provided exogenously, these patients often show robust glucose clearance (sometimes even requiring careful dosing to avoid hypoglycemia, given their preserved insulin sensitivity).

- **Fatty acid oxidation & ketone metabolism (GO:0006629 & GO:0046951)** – Normally, lack of insulin triggers adipose lipolysis and hepatic fatty acid oxidation, generating ketones. In MRDM, this metabolic switch is blunted. The processes of **fatty acid catabolism and ketogenesis** are relatively inactive despite insulin deficiency. This is evidenced by the unusual ketosis-resistance: even with very low insulin, MRDM patients do not significantly accumulate ketone bodies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin%20to%20control%20the%20hyperglycemia%2C,the%20absence%20of%20clinical%20and)). Biologically, this suggests alterations in the regulation of hormone-sensitive lipase in fat tissue and in the hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway. Malnutrition might downregulate carnitine-palmitoyl transferase or other enzymes needed for ketone production, or the lack of glucagon fails to upregulate these pathways. Therefore, the typical process *“ketone body metabolic process”* (GO:0046950) is dampened in MRDM. This protects against acidosis but is a double-edged sword: it may reflect an inability to mobilize alternative fuels during starvation.

- **Protein catabolic process (GO:0030163)** – In the malnourished diabetic state, the body relies heavily on protein breakdown for gluconeogenesis. Proteolysis in muscle is accelerated by high cortisol and low insulin, providing amino acids for the liver to convert to glucose. MRDM patients often present with muscle wasting due to this **increased proteolysis and gluconeogenesis**, which are part of the starvation response. Normally, insulin suppresses proteolysis, but in MRDM its absence means unchecked muscle breakdown. This contributes to fatigue and weakness clinically, and further worsens insulin sensitivity long-term (as muscle is the main site of glucose disposal). The **balance of anabolism vs catabolism** is shifted strongly toward catabolic processes in MRDM, until insulin therapy and nutrition are provided to restore it.

- **Digestive processes (GO:0007586)** – Particularly in FCPD, chronic pancreatitis impairs the digestive process. Exocrine insufficiency means fats and starches are poorly digested, leading to malabsorption. This not only causes steatorrhea and nutrient loss but also signals within the gut that can modulate incretin hormones. Some studies suggest the incretin effect (GLP-1, GIP release in response to meals) might be altered in tropical diabetes due to intestinal adaptation; however, data are limited. In any case, the normal process of nutrient digestion and absorption is disrupted, compounding the malnutrition and metabolic imbalance.

- **Cellular response to stress (GO:0033554)** – Malnutrition and hyperglycemia together induce oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cells. β-cells under ER stress may undergo dysfunction or apoptosis (unfolded protein response triggered by trying to produce insulin in a malnourished state). Similarly, the liver in these patients experiences oxidative stress from chronic high blood sugar and possibly toxin exposure (e.g. cyanide detoxification strain). The cells’ antioxidant defenses (glutathione etc.) are often low in malnutrition, so the process of responding to oxidative stress is overtaxed. This contributes to progressive β-cell damage and could partly explain why nutritional rehabilitation alone may not fully restore β-cell function – some cells have been lost to programmed cell death due to chronic stress.

In summary, MRDM perturbs a network of biological processes: **insulin secretion, metabolic fuel usage, organ development, and stress responses** are all affected. These disruptions tie together the clinical picture of a lean individual whose body is stuck in a quasi-starved, diabetic state – unable to properly use glucose due to lack of insulin, yet also unable to switch to alternate fuels effectively.

## Cellular and Subcellular Components Involved

On the cellular level, MRDM involves specific components within and outside cells where key dysfunctions occur:

- **Pancreatic islets (of Langerhans)** – The islets are the micro-organs containing insulin-secreting β-cells and glucagon-secreting α-cells. In MRDM, the islets are often visibly shrunken and depleted. **Islet β-cell cytoplasm and secretory granules** are crucial components: normally, insulin is synthesized in the β-cell cytosol/ER and stored in granules for release. In malnutrition, these β-cells have fewer secretory granules and diminished insulin content. Electron microscopy in experimental protein-malnutrition shows reduced granule density in β-cells due to lower proinsulin synthesis. Thus, the **insulin secretory granule (GO:0030141)** is a key cellular component affected – it’s present in lower numbers and possibly has abnormal content (proinsulin processing might be impaired if enzymes or Zn²⁺ cofactors are deficient). When nutrients are scarce, even the intracellular machinery of β-cells (ribosomes, Golgi) may be downscaled, limiting insulin production capacity.

- **Exocrine pancreatic ducts and acini** – In fibrocalculous disease, calcium deposits form in **pancreatic ducts and acinar lumina**, obstructing them. The **pancreatic ductal epithelium** and acinar cell zymogen granules are sites where precipitates of protein and calcium accumulate (forming stones). These components are not only markers of damage but also propagate it: ductal obstruction leads to higher pressure and acinar rupture, spilling digestive enzymes that further destroy tissue. The fibrosis that replaces acinar cells alters the **extracellular matrix (ECM)** composition in the pancreas – collagen deposition in islet and acinar regions physically distorts the islets. So, components like **collagen fibers (extracellular)** become abnormally abundant in the pancreatic microenvironment, isolating and strangling the remaining islet cells.

- **Mitochondria in β-cells** – Subcellularly, mitochondria are critical for coupling glucose metabolism to insulin secretion (through ATP generation). Malnutrition, particularly deficiencies in micronutrients (like B-vitamins, iron) required for mitochondrial enzymes, can impair mitochondrial function. There is emerging interest in whether MRDM involves mitochondrial dysfunction in β-cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=to%20be%20determined%20as%20one,patients%20with%20T2D%20and%20T1D)). If β-cell mitochondria cannot ramp up ATP production in response to glucose, insulin granule exocytosis will be blunted. Also, chronic undernutrition may reduce the number of mitochondria per cell (since cell energy throughput is low). Investigations using transcriptomics have hinted at altered expression of mitochondrial genes in lean diabetics, suggesting the **mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain** is a component worth scrutinizing in MRDM ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=to%20be%20determined%20as%20one,patients%20with%20T2D%20and%20T1D)). Additionally, toxins like cyanide directly target cytochrome oxidase in mitochondria, which could acutely poison β-cell metabolism in cassava-consuming individuals. Thus, the health and density of **β-cell mitochondria** are likely reduced, contributing to deficient insulin release.

- **Glucose transporters on muscle/fat cell membranes** – In peripheral tissues, **GLUT4 transporters** on cell membranes (a component of the plasma membrane signaling machinery) are normally upregulated by insulin. In MRDM, insulin levels are chronically low, so GLUT4 translocation is sub-optimal, especially when any insulin resistance from infection or stress is present. However, interestingly, because MRDM patients are insulin-sensitive, their muscle cells likely maintain normal insulin receptor and GLUT4 function – when insulin is administered, GLUT4 moves efficiently to the membrane. We might consider the **insulin receptor (a membrane protein)** and downstream signaling components (IRS-1, PI3K, etc.) as intact cellular machinery that just isn’t being sufficiently triggered due to lack of hormone. So these components are not defective in MRDM per se, but they represent the *untapped capacity* for glucose uptake that could be realized with treatment. One could say the *sarcolemma* of muscle fibers with embedded GLUT4 is a component that remains responsive and is a therapeutic target (e.g., giving insulin or improving nutrition will engage these transporters to lower blood sugar).

- **Blood (vascular compartment)** – Although not a “cellular component” of a cell, the blood plasma is the extracellular compartment where hormones and metabolites interact abnormally in MRDM. Persistent hyperglycemia in the blood (high glucose concentration in plasma) is the result of the disrupted intracellular processes. Also, low circulating insulin in plasma and low C-peptide are key laboratory markers. The **plasma compartment** is where we observe the net effect of pancreatic failure and insulin action mismatch. Additionally, blood levels of nutrients (e.g. low albumin, anemia) reflect the malnourished state. The biochemical milieu of the blood in MRDM often shows high glucose, low insulin, low C-peptide, and sometimes deficiencies in vitamins and minerals – essentially, an extracellular reflection of the cellular dysfunctions.

In summary, MRDM’s pathophysiology plays out across various cellular components: **within pancreatic β-cells (secretory granules, mitochondria, ER), within exocrine pancreatic structures (acini, ducts, ECM), at the cell membranes of insulin target cells (GLUT4 transporters), and in the circulating blood** where metabolic imbalances manifest. Each level – from organelles to organs – shows changes consistent with a body under metabolic stress due to long-term undernutrition, culminating in diabetes.

## Disease Progression and Sequence of Events

MRDM often follows a characteristic chronology from nutritional insult to overt diabetes:

- **Early nutritional deprivation (Trigger):** The sequence commonly begins with **chronic undernutrition in childhood or adolescence**. This can result from poverty-driven food insecurity, chronic famine, or diseases causing malabsorption. During this critical period, nutrient scarcity (especially protein) impairs pancreatic growth and β-cell reserve ([idf.org](https://idf.org/about-diabetes/types-of-diabetes/type-5-diabetes/#:~:text=Type%205%20diabetes%20results%20from,due%20to%20underdeveloped%20pancreatic%20tissue)). If malnutrition is severe from a young age, the individual’s pancreas remains small and less capable of compensating for metabolic challenges later. In some cases, **poor maternal nutrition in utero** already programs the fetus for a limited β-cell endowment (the “thrifty phenotype” hypothesis). By the time of late childhood, these individuals may have borderline glucose tolerance, though it often goes unrecognized.

- **Subclinical phase:** As malnutrition continues, the person remains very lean with limited subcutaneous fat and muscle. Blood glucose may start to rise gradually due to the strain on diminished insulin secretion. During this phase, **no ketosis or acute symptoms** occur – the body adapts to low insulin by reducing growth and slowing metabolism. If the individual experiences infections or stress (e.g. puberty or pregnancy can increase insulin needs), the limited β-cell function may be further stressed, unmasking impaired glucose tolerance. Often, **recurrent infections (like gastrointestinal or tuberculosis) and ongoing malabsorption** punctuate this phase, each time worsening nutritional status and potentially injuring β-cells via inflammation.

- **Onset of diabetes:** Eventually, a point is reached where insulin output can no longer maintain euglycemia. **Over diabetes onset is often in the teenage years or early adulthood**, with patients typically <30 years old ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=the%20genesis%20and%20atypical%20features,the%20absence%20of%20clinical%20and)). The precipitant might be an acute infection, or simply the cumulative β-cell attrition. Clinically, the patient develops classic symptoms: **polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and weight loss** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin.,incorporated%20the%20category%20of%20malnutrition)). However, unlike type 1 DM, **ketoacidosis is absent** – the patient is often found to have high blood glucose but no significant ketones. Many patients are diagnosed when they present for fatigue, persistent weight loss or an infection, rather than DKA. At diagnosis, they usually have *very low BMI* (often <18) and signs of chronic nutritional deficits (stunted growth if onset was young, muscle wasting, etc.) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=undernutrition%20show%20some%20unique%20features,is%20independently%20associated%20with%20metabolic)). Laboratory tests show hyperglycemia with **low C-peptide**, confirming endogenous insulin deficiency, yet often negative autoimmune markers (GAD, IA-2 antibodies negative) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=led%20by%20Meredith%20Hawkins%2C%20who,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)).

- **Initial management and “insulin-sensitive” phase:** Once diagnosed, patients are typically started on insulin (because oral agents like sulfonylureas are usually ineffective due to the near-absolute insulinopenia). In the initial phase of treatment, they often require **high doses of insulin** to control blood sugar – reports describe MRDM patients needing >1–2 units/kg of insulin per day ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=,as%20a%20possible%20factor%20in)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=characterized%20by%20a%20socioeconomic%20setting,dysfunction%20and%20relative%20resistance%20to)). This high requirement likely reflects the complete lack of endogenous insulin (so all insulin must be supplied exogenously) and possibly some resistance due to concurrent infections or hormonal imbalances. As insulin therapy and **nutritional rehabilitation** proceed, a notable phenomenon occurs: the patient’s glycemic control improves and **insulin requirements may drop**. For example, in one case a severely malnourished teenager initially required 3.3 U/kg insulin, but after months of nutritional recovery his requirement fell to ~1.2 U/kg ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=diagnosis%20of%20type%201%20diabetes,up%20with%20good)). Gaining weight and restoring lean mass can partially improve glucose utilization and even β-cell function (if any functional reserve exists). This is akin to a “honeymoon” period or partial remission, but it does not indicate cure – rather, it reflects the removal of nutritional stress and possibly improved insulin sensitivity as infections resolve.

- **Potential remission vs. persistence:** Some MRDM patients, especially those with milder β-cell impairment, might maintain fair control on a lower insulin dose once well-nourished, leading to the impression that nutrition was the main factor. However, **in most cases diabetes persists** lifelong, indicating permanent pancreatic damage. Indeed, studies have found that even after weight gain, MRDM patients **cannot switch to oral agents alone and remain insulin-dependent**: in one study, after rehabilitation, patients were still unresponsive to sulfonylurea (glibenclamide) and quickly developed hyperglycemia and ketosis if insulin was withdrawn ([journals.lww.com](https://journals.lww.com/indjem/fulltext/2025/09000/malnutrition_modulated_diabetes__a_variant_of.6.aspx#:~:text=rehabilitation%20and%20weight%20gain%20in,It%20also%20showed%20that%20the)). This demonstrates that malnutrition triggered an irreversible loss of insulin-producing capacity in those individuals – improving nutrition helps but **does not fully restore β-cell function** ([journals.lww.com](https://journals.lww.com/indjem/fulltext/2025/09000/malnutrition_modulated_diabetes__a_variant_of.6.aspx#:~:text=rehabilitation%20and%20weight%20gain%20in,It%20also%20showed%20that%20the)). Thus, the disease progresses to a chronic phase similar to other forms of insulin-dependent diabetes.

- **Chronic phase and complications:** In the long-term, MRDM patients require ongoing insulin therapy (often intermediate- or long-acting insulin with mealtime short-acting insulin) along with nutritional support. If well-managed, they can achieve decent glycemic control; if not, chronic hyperglycemia can lead to typical diabetic complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy). There isn’t strong evidence that complication rates are fundamentally different in MRDM versus other diabetes, though the coexistence of malnutrition might accelerate some complications (e.g. poor wound healing, infections) while possibly reducing others (e.g. less atherosclerosis if lipid levels are low). One difference is that **hypoglycemia risk might be higher** during treatment because these patients lack glycogen stores and glucagon response. Also, in fibrocalculous diabetes, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can cause frequent abdominal pain, pancreatic pseudocysts, or deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins – these comorbid issues can complicate diabetes management. Over years, some MRDM patients might lose even the small residual β-cell function they had, especially if any latent autoimmunity or additional pancreatitis episodes occur, effectively becoming indistinguishable from type 1 diabetes in management (absolute insulin deficiency).

- **Late outcomes:** With global nutrition improving, the incidence of new MRDM cases may decline in some regions, but those already affected will continue to require care. If nutritional status remains marginal, these patients are at risk for recurrent infections like tuberculosis, which can create a dangerous feedback: TB can worsen blood sugar control and diabetes can worsen TB outcomes. In older classifications, MRDM was thought to perhaps “burn out” (some earlier reports suggested that after a certain age, the diabetes stabilized or insulin needs decreased, possibly due to lifestyle or mortality). However, contemporary follow-up indicates that MRDM is generally a *lifelong condition* requiring medical therapy. The progression is one of a chronic disease that started due to an environmental insult (undernutrition) and continues as a metabolic disorder.

In essence, the **disease progression** of MRDM starts with **malnutrition impairing pancreatic function** (gradually, often silently), then **diabetes manifests in youth** with unique features (lean, ketosis-resistant), and despite treatment and refeeding, **permanent β-cell loss keeps the patient diabetic**. There may be a transient improvement with nutritional recovery, but underlying insulin secretion defects persist. This underscores that early nutritional interventions (e.g. preventing childhood malnutrition) could avert the disease in the first place – a point of emphasis for public health strategies in affected regions.

## Phenotypic Manifestations and Clinical Correlates

MRDM presents with a distinctive clinical phenotype linking back to its pathophysiology. Key phenotypic features include:

- **Severe leanness and stigmata of malnutrition:** Patients are typically underweight or even emaciated, with **body mass index (BMI) often < 18.5** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=undernutrition%20show%20some%20unique%20features,is%20independently%20associated%20with%20metabolic)). Many have visible muscle wasting (thin upper arms, loss of subcutaneous fat) and other signs of chronic undernutrition such as dry, flaky skin, hair changes, or micronutrient deficiencies. They often appear **poorly nourished even before the onset of diabetes symptoms** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=same%20characteristics%2C%20but%20differs%20from,incorporated%20the%20category%20of%20malnutrition)). In children or teens, there may be growth stunting or delayed puberty from long-term nutritional deprivation. It's common for MRDM patients to come from low socio-economic backgrounds with a history of food insecurity or famine ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=the%20genesis%20and%20atypical%20features,malnutrition%2C%20a%20high%20dose%20of)). In one description: *“Patients with MRDM [are] characterized by a socioeconomic setting of poverty and undernutrition, young age (<30 years), [and] clinical evidence of malnutrition”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=the%20genesis%20and%20atypical%20features,malnutrition%2C%20a%20high%20dose%20of)).

- **Young age of onset:** MRDM generally manifests in **adolescence or early adulthood** (typically between ages ~10–30). It used to be called **“tropical youth-onset diabetes”** for this reason. Unlike type 2 diabetes which often occurs in middle-aged or obese persons, or type 1 which peaks in childhood, MRDM commonly affects lean teenagers or 20-somethings living in developing regions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=the%20genesis%20and%20atypical%20features,the%20absence%20of%20clinical%20and)). For example, many cases are reported in patients around 15–25 years old. The youth onset reflects both the timing of maximal stress on the underdeveloped pancreas and the cumulative impact of years of malnutrition by that age.

- **Classic hyperglycemic symptoms:** Despite the unusual background, MRDM patients do exhibit the **classic symptoms of diabetes** – notably **polyuria (excessive urination), polydipsia (excess thirst), polyphagia (excess hunger), and unintentional weight loss** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin.,incorporated%20the%20category%20of%20malnutrition)). Polyphagia (excessive eating) is especially pronounced because these patients are often starving nutritionally; they may consume large quantities of whatever food is available and yet continue to lose weight. The weight loss can be dramatic, as it’s driven by both uncontrolled hyperglycemia (calorie loss in urine) and the prior malnutrition. Patients also report **fatigue and weakness** – this stems from muscle wasting and lack of energy substrate due to insulin deficiency. Some have **abdominal cramps** or pain, which could be due to electrolyte imbalances or, in FCPD, recurrent pancreatitis episodes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin.,incorporated%20the%20category%20of%20malnutrition)). Overall, the presenting complaints align with those of uncontrolled diabetes, just in a much thinner individual than usual.

- **Absence of ketoacidosis:** A key distinguishing phenotype is that MRDM patients are **not prone to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)**. They are often described as having “ketone-resistant diabetes” ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=,as%20a%20possible%20factor%20in)). Clinically, this means at diagnosis (or during insulin omission), they do **not develop high anion-gap metabolic acidosis or Kussmaul breathing**, which are hallmarks of DKA. For instance, a malnourished diabetic can present with blood glucose of say 400 mg/dL, but only minimal ketonuria and a nearly normal blood pH. Even if insulin is withheld, they tend to become dehydrated and hyperglycemic but **do not easily tip into ketoacidotic coma** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin%20to%20control%20the%20hyperglycemia%2C,are%20lean%20even%20before%20the)). As one source notes: *“Patients with MMDM do not develop ketosis even after stopping insulin for prolonged periods”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=insulin%20to%20control%20the%20hyperglycemia%2C,are%20lean%20even%20before%20the)). This phenotypic feature correlates with the pathophysiology of partial insulin presence and possibly reduced glucagon, as discussed. It is useful diagnostically: in a young underweight diabetic, the lack of ketosis can alert clinicians to an atypical diabetes form. However, it’s not absolute – if stressed or if malnutrition is partially reversed, some MRDM patients *can* develop ketosis (especially those with overlapping autoimmune diabetes). For example, after nutritional rehabilitation, several patients have developed ketosis upon insulin withdrawal ([journals.lww.com](https://journals.lww.com/indjem/fulltext/2025/09000/malnutrition_modulated_diabetes__a_variant_of.6.aspx#:~:text=rehabilitation%20and%20weight%20gain%20in,It%20also%20showed%20that%20the)). But generally, at presentation, **DKA is rare** in true MRDM.

- **High insulin requirements but high insulin sensitivity:** Paradoxically, MRDM patients often require unusually large doses of insulin to control blood sugar, yet **they are very insulin-sensitive** in physiology. The high dose requirement (100+ units per day in an adult, or >1–2 U/kg) likely reflects the near-total lack of endogenous insulin – essentially one must replace all basal and bolus insulin pharmacologically. Indeed, it was reported that MRDM patients needed “a high dose of insulin to control the hyperglycemia” ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=the%20genesis%20and%20atypical%20features,are%20not%20prone%20to%20ketosis)). However, once insulin is given, their tissues respond vigorously (due to little insulin resistance). This can be observed as frequent hypoglycemic episodes if insulin dose overshoots, or the marked improvement in glycemia with small dose adjustments. In research comparisons, MRDM individuals had **greater peripheral glucose uptake for a given insulin level than type 2 diabetics** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=1%20,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)). Clinicians thus note that these patients can be “brittle” in the sense of narrow insulin dosing range – they swing from hyperglycemia to hypoglycemia easily, because they lack the buffering of insulin resistance or residual pancreatic function. The combination of *“insulin requirement is high, but tissues are insulin-sensitive”* is a striking phenotype, corroborating the idea that malnutrition affects insulin supply more than insulin action.

- **Negative autoimmune markers:** From a diagnostic standpoint, MRDM patients usually test **negative for type 1 diabetes autoantibodies** (GAD65, IA-2, ICA, zinc transporter-8, etc.) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=led%20by%20Meredith%20Hawkins%2C%20who,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)). Phenotypically, this isn’t directly observable, but it is a lab finding that aligns with the clinical picture. The absence of autoimmune markers helps differentiate MRDM from latent autoimmune diabetes of youth (LADA) or classic type 1. Some patients may have low-titer antibodies or ambiguous results, but the majority in MRDM case series are negative, consistent with a non-autoimmune etiology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=led%20by%20Meredith%20Hawkins%2C%20who,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)). Also, these patients often lack a family history of type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune diseases – again reflecting a different phenotype (one rooted in environmental rather than genetic-autoimmune causes).

- **Evidence of pancreatic damage (in FCPD):** In those with the fibrocalculous form, certain phenotypic clues point to pancreatic pathology. They may have a history of **recurrent abdominal pain** since childhood (due to pancreatitis attacks). On exam, they can have epigastric tenderness or even a palpable pancreatic calcification (if large). Imaging (X-ray or ultrasound) reveals **pancreatic calcifications** in the majority of FCPD patients. Also, these patients might have **steatorrhea** – bulky, foul-smelling stools from fat malabsorption – indicating exocrine insufficiency. They tend to be even more malnourished (because of malabsorption) and often require pancreatic enzyme supplements in addition to insulin. While these features are not present in pure PDDM, their presence in a lean diabetic patient strongly suggests fibrocalculous MRDM. It essentially looks like chronic pancreatitis with diabetes in a malnourished individual – a phenotype distinct from alcoholic pancreatitis (since patients are young and often do not consume significant alcohol). 

- **Concurrent nutrient deficiencies and infection susceptibility:** Phenotypically, MRDM patients may show signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies: e.g. vitamin A deficiency (night blindness), vitamin D deficiency (bone pain), iron deficiency anemia (pallor), etc., owing to their poor diet and absorption. Their immune function is impaired, so they might have chronic skin infections, oral thrush, or TB. Some studies from Africa reported **higher prevalence of tuberculosis** in malnourished diabetics than in typical diabetics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12536902/#:~:text=the%20variants%20of%20the%20classical,these%20controversies%2C%20further%20research%20is)). Clinicians often must treat underlying tuberculosis or parasitic infections when managing MRDM. This intersects with phenotype: MRDM patients sometimes present with an infection (like a non-healing ulcer or pneumonia) that is out of proportion, given their young age – the combination of diabetes and malnutrition predisposes them to such infections.

- **Global distribution:** From an epidemiological phenotype perspective, MRDM is predominantly seen in **low- and middle-income countries in the tropics**, such as rural India, Bangladesh, parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and less frequently in Latin America. It’s rare or essentially non-existent in high-income countries (except in refugees or individuals who experienced severe famine). For instance, historical reports noted MRDM accounted for 40–50% of young adult diabetes cases in some parts of India in the 20th century ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2304128/#:~:text=Cite%20Display%20options%20,the%20Indian%20subcontinent%20and%20possibly)). Today, it is still encountered in South Asia and Africa; the International Diabetes Federation estimates **20–25 million people worldwide may have MRDM** (type 5 diabetes), primarily in underserved regions ([idf.org](https://idf.org/news/new-type-5-diabetes-working-group/#:~:text=Type%205%20diabetes%20is%20estimated,income%20countries%20%28LMICs)). This geographic phenotype aligns with areas of chronic food insecurity. In contrast, systematic searches in well-nourished populations (e.g. a Taiwanese hospital study) found essentially no MRDM cases ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8640103/#:~:text=,or)), underlining the link to malnutrition. Thus, the **demographic phenotype** is a young, impoverished person in a developing country – quite different from the stereotypical patient with type 2 (older, overweight) or type 1 (child from any background).

- **Clinical course differences:** Phenotypically, MRDM runs a somewhat different clinical course than other diabetes forms. For example, **insulin therapy plus nutrition can dramatically improve health** – weight gain is a positive prognostic sign. As the patient’s weight increases, one often observes improved strength and even partial recovery of glycemic control (though not full remission) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=diagnosis%20of%20type%201%20diabetes,up%20with%20good)). This responsiveness to nutrition is part of the phenotype; in contrast, increasing weight in a type 2 diabetic often worsens diabetes, but in MRDM it’s therapeutic. Another feature is that MRDM patients may not fit neatly into standard diagnostic categories, so they often experience misclassification. Some are initially labeled type 1 (due to insulin requirement) but then noted to be antibody-negative and ketosis-resistant; others might be misdiagnosed as type 2 (due to ketosis resistance) but they are young and lean, which is incongruent. This “atypical” nature is itself a phenotype – historically called “J-type” or “tropical diabetes” because it didn’t align with the classic forms. Clinicians in affected regions are advised to suspect MRDM in any **young, underweight diabetic who doesn’t neatly fit type 1 or type 2 profiles** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12494382/#:~:text=This%20presentation%20of%20the%20disease,distinct%20clinical%20phenotype%20%2012)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7457811/#:~:text=,malnutrition%2C%20a%20high%20dose%20of)).

In conclusion, the phenotypic manifestations of MRDM – **youthful onset, extreme leanness, classic diabetic symptoms without ketoacidosis, high insulin needs but high sensitivity, malnutrition signs, and a tropical geographic distribution** – all flow logically from its underlying pathophysiology. The lack of insulin from a nutritionally compromised pancreas explains the hyperglycemia and weight loss; the retention of some β-cell function (and α-cell impairment) explains the ketosis resistance; the malnutrition explains the body habitus and concurrent health issues. These clinical features, backed by laboratory findings (low C-peptide, negative antibodies, pancreatic calcifications in FCPD, etc.), paint a coherent picture that helps in diagnosing and understanding MRDM as a distinct entity. As research advances and awareness grows (with groups like the IDF formalizing “type 5” diabetes), recognizing this phenotype is crucial for implementing appropriate treatment – namely, **addressing both the diabetes with insulin and the underlying malnutrition with nutritional rehabilitation**. Each phenotypic trait – from low BMI to absence of ketosis – underscores the importance of this dual approach to management, as well as the broader public health need to prevent malnutrition to combat this form of diabetes.

Concluded that SPINK1 mutations predispose individuals to tropical calcific pancreatitis and secondary diabetes, though not everyone with the mutation develops the disease (indicating additional environmental triggers like malnutrition are required) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC378551/#:~:text=to%20chronic%20pancreatitis,to%20determine%20whether%20N34S%20was)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC378551/#:~:text=matched%20control%20group%29,not%20sufficient%20to%20cause%20disease)). This study provided a molecular explanation for why certain individuals in malnourished populations get pancreatitis and MRDM – a gene-environment interaction.**

Each of the above references provides evidence for the mechanisms and characteristics of malnutrition-related diabetes. Together, they paint a consistent picture: **MRDM is a distinct form of diabetes caused by chronic undernutrition leading to an underperforming pancreas, resulting in a lean, insulin-deficient, ketosis-resistant diabetic state.** The latest research (2023–2024) reinforces this understanding and has prompted international efforts (IDF 2025) to formally recognize and address this condition as a unique category of diabetes, with tailored diagnostic criteria and management guidelines. The convergence of expert opinion and new data underscores both the scientific importance of MRDM and the humanitarian need to prevent and treat it by improving nutrition in vulnerable populations.
