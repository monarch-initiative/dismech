### 1. Core Pathophysiology  
Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome is fundamentally an **epigenetic disorder** caused by loss-of-function variants in the **KMT2A** gene (also known as **MLL**). KMT2A encodes a histone methyltransferase that normally adds methyl groups to lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) at gene promoters, a modification associated with active transcription ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3415539/#:~:text=Steiner%20syndrome%20%28WSS%29,anomaly%20syndromes%2C%20and%20further)). **De novo heterozygous mutations** in KMT2A (typically nonsense or frameshift) lead to **haploinsufficiency**, meaning only one functional copy of this critical enzyme is available ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3415539/#:~:text=Steiner%20syndrome%20%28WSS%29,anomaly%20syndromes%2C%20and%20further)). As a result, the overall **H3K4 methylation** level is reduced, disrupting the normal chromatin state and **deregulating gene expression** across many developmental pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3415539/#:~:text=is%20predicted%20to%20result%20in,anomaly%20syndromes%2C%20and%20further)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35163737/#:~:text=without%20known%20genetic%20variants,phenotypic%20spectrum%20of%20the%20disease)). In the original discovery, mutant KMT2A transcripts were shown to undergo nonsense-mediated decay, confirming that **reduced KMT2A dosage** (rather than a dominant-negative effect) is the disease mechanism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3415539/#:~:text=a%20histone%20methyltransferase%20that%20regulates,regulation%20of%20histone%20modification%20in)). *“These findings…provide additional evidence for the role of haploinsufficiency of histone-modification enzymes in multiple-congenital-anomaly syndromes”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3415539/#:~:text=is%20predicted%20to%20result%20in,anomaly%20syndromes%2C%20and%20further)), establishing WSS as a disorder of insufficient epigenetic “writing” activity during development. 

Because KMT2A is a master regulator of gene transcription, its deficiency leads to **widespread transcriptional dysregulation**. WSS belongs to a class of neurodevelopmental disorders called **chromatinopathies**, caused by mutations in chromatin regulators ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10941593/#:~:text=The%20KMT2A%20gene%20encodes%20a,anal%20fistula%20as%20a%20related)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11431573/#:~:text=disorders%20called%20chromatinopathies,Whole%20exome)). The downstream effect is an imbalance in the expression of hundreds of genes involved in growth, development, and cell function. For example, patient-derived cells show altered expression of known KMT2A target genes – including cell-cycle regulators **CDKN2C** (p18) and **CDKN1B** (p27), and developmental transcription factors like **HOXA9**, **MEIS1**, and **SIX2** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20target%20genes%20of,between%20control%20and%20KMT2A%20mutated)). Many of these genes are crucial for organ development and cell proliferation, explaining the multi-system features of WSS. A **global DNA methylation profiling** study found that WSS patients have a distinctive “epi-signature” with *global reduction of DNA methylation* at numerous loci (notably at homeobox gene promoters) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35163737/#:~:text=without%20known%20genetic%20variants,phenotypic%20spectrum%20of%20the%20disease)). This suggests that KMT2A mutations cause broad epigenomic changes beyond histones alone, reinforcing the idea that **epigenetic misregulation underlies the diverse manifestations** of WSS ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35163737/#:~:text=without%20known%20genetic%20variants,phenotypic%20spectrum%20of%20the%20disease)). 

In summary, the core pathophysiology of WSS is a **failure of proper histone H3K4 methylation and chromatin activation**, due to KMT2A haploinsufficiency ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3415539/#:~:text=Steiner%20syndrome%20%28WSS%29,anomaly%20syndromes%2C%20and%20further)). This leads to **perturbed transcriptional programs** during embryonic and postnatal development. Key developmental genes are improperly expressed, resulting in abnormalities in cell fate, proliferation, and tissue formation. The concept is exemplified by the designation of WSS as a *Mendelian Disorder of the Epigenetic Machinery (MDEM)* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=phenotype%20in%20WDSTS%20is%20treatable,candidate%20for%20future%20therapeutic%20strategies)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=Introduction)) – a genetic disease where an epigenetic regulator is impaired. Crucially, unlike many structural genetic defects, epigenetic alterations are potentially **reversible**, since aberrant chromatin states could be reversed by other enzymatic “erasers” or targeted therapies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11431573/#:~:text=Mutations%20in%20genes%20coding%20for,82%2C37)). This opens the door for future mechanism-based treatments to possibly **restore normal gene expression** in WSS, an area of active research.

### 2. Key Molecular Players  
- **Genes/Proteins:** The causative gene is **KMT2A (HGNC:7132)**, which encodes the lysine methyltransferase 2A (aliases: MLL, TRX1). KMT2A is a large multi-domain protein (3,969 amino acids) that contains a SET domain conferring **histone H3K4 methyltransferase** activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3415539/#:~:text=Steiner%20syndrome%20%28WSS%29,anomaly%20syndromes%2C%20and%20further)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11431573/#:~:text=prevalence%20of%20,The%20KMT2A%20protein)). It is part of a **chromatin-modifying complex** (COMPASS) that includes other cofactors (e.g. WDR5, ASH2L, RBBP5, DPY30) required for efficient H3K4 trimethylation on histone tails. No other gene has been definitively linked to WSS; heterozygous **KMT2A** pathogenic variants are sufficient to cause the full syndrome ([search.clinicalgenome.org](https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/conditions/MONDO%3A0011518#:~:text=Wiedemann,%28Source)). In rare cases, large 11q23.3 deletions encompassing KMT2A also result in WSS, underscoring that losing KMT2A function is key ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12502264/#:~:text=developmental%20delay%20varied%20among%20the,the%2010%20variants%20were%20novel)). The **KMT2A protein** normally localizes to the nucleus and binds DNA at target gene promoters/enhancers to activate transcription. Some **missense mutations** in WSS can perturb critical domains (e.g. the CXXC DNA-binding domain or SET domain), leading to mislocalization of the protein or loss of interaction with chromatin ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=splice%20variant%20c.11322,different%20functional%20domains%20and%20suggested)). The net effect is a **reduction of KMT2A function**, identified as the principal disease-driving mechanism ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=patient%27s%20fibroblasts%20compared%20to%20controls,causing%20mechanism)). Secondary molecular players are the downstream targets of KMT2A – for instance, reduced KMT2A activity can cause lower expression of **HOX genes** and **cell cycle inhibitors**, which in turn contribute to developmental defects ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20target%20genes%20of,between%20control%20and%20KMT2A%20mutated)). Notably, **HOXA9** and **MEIS1**, targets of KMT2A important in hematopoiesis and development, are downregulated in patient fibroblasts ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20target%20genes%20of,between%20control%20and%20KMT2A%20mutated)), which may relate to some skeletal and immune features. Likewise, **SIX2**, a transcription factor for kidney development, is a KMT2A target whose diminished expression could explain renal anomalies observed in some individuals ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20target%20genes%20of,between%20control%20and%20KMT2A%20mutated)). 

- **Chemical Entities:** KMT2A’s enzymatic activity uses the universal methyl donor **S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)** as a cofactor to methylate histones (producing S-adenosylhomocysteine as a byproduct). Thus, SAM (CHEBI:15414) is directly involved in the histone methylation reaction catalyzed by KMT2A. There are currently no small-molecule therapies that directly increase KMT2A activity; however, the **epigenetic dysregulation** in WSS suggests potential targets. For example, inhibitors of H3K4 demethylases or global chromatin-modifying drugs could, in theory, compensate for reduced H3K4 methylation. In the laboratory, **histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors** and other epigenetic drugs have been tested in related chromatinopathies (e.g. Kabuki syndrome) to rebalance gene expression ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40956618/#:~:text=Wiedemann,To%20explore%20whether%20the%20neurological)). No specific metabolite abnormality is known in WSS, but **recombinant human Growth Hormone (rhGH)** is a relevant therapeutic *chemical* used in practice to treat short stature in WSS patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=Four%20patients%20had%20short%20stature%2C,retardation%2C%20intellectual%20delay%2C%20distinctive%20facial)). For instance, treating WSS children with rhGH for several years can significantly improve height (by ~1–2 standard deviations) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=Four%20patients%20had%20short%20stature%2C,retardation%2C%20intellectual%20delay%2C%20distinctive%20facial)), indicating that hormonal therapy can modulate one downstream phenotype (growth failure) despite the underlying molecular lesion. 

- **Cell Types:** Given its role in development, KMT2A is critical in many cell types, but **neuronal cells** are especially impacted. WSS is characterized by developmental delay and intellectual disability, implying that **neurons (CL:0000540)** and neural progenitors in the developing brain are key affected cells. Studies in model organisms confirm this – mice with Kmt2a haploinsufficiency have impaired neuronal function, particularly in **hippocampal neurons** linked to memory formation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=phenotype%20in%20WDSTS%20is%20treatable,candidate%20for%20future%20therapeutic%20strategies)). **Fibroblasts (CL:0000057)** from WSS patients have been used to demonstrate molecular defects (showing altered expression of KMT2A target genes) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20target%20genes%20of,between%20control%20and%20KMT2A%20mutated)), indicating that even connective tissue cells exhibit the epigenetic dysregulation. In the endocrine system, **pituitary cells** are likely affected: some WSS patients have growth hormone deficiency and pituitary hypoplasia, suggesting that KMT2A mutations perturb pituitary development or function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=disorders,Otherwise%2C%20zebrafish)). Additionally, **immune cells** (particularly B lymphocytes) can be impacted – a subset of patients show hypogammaglobulinemia (low immunoglobulin levels) and recurrent infections ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27320412/#:~:text=Jones%20and%20co,%C2%A9%202016%20Wiley)), pointing to defective B-cell or plasma cell function. Other cell types that may be involved include **cardiomyocytes** (in those with congenital heart defects) and **renal epithelial cells** (in those with kidney anomalies), although these have not been studied in detail. In general, cell types with high rates of proliferation or complex differentiation during development (neurons, hematopoietic cells, chondrocytes, etc.) are vulnerable when KMT2A-regulated gene expression is disrupted. 

- **Anatomical Locations:** WSS affects multiple organs, reflecting KMT2A’s broad role. Key anatomical locations include the **brain (UBERON:0000955)** – WSS individuals often have mild structural changes or at least functional impairment in the central nervous system, correlating with intellectual disability and, in some cases, seizures ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27320412/#:~:text=Jones%20and%20co,%C2%A9%202016%20Wiley)). The **facial region/skull (head)** is prominently affected, as evidenced by distinct craniofacial dysmorphisms (e.g. wide nasal bridge, downslanting palpebral fissures) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=additional%20congenital%20anomalies,hypotonia)). Consistently, Kmt2a^+/− mice show **craniofacial abnormalities** paralleling the human facial phenotype ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=phenotype%20in%20WDSTS%20is%20treatable,candidate%20for%20future%20therapeutic%20strategies)). The **skeletal system (bones and vertebrae)** is involved – patients often have short stature, and some have vertebral segmentation anomalies ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=hypertrichosis%20cubiti%20%28,renal)). This suggests KMT2A-driven defects in bone growth plates or embryonic somite development. The **skin and hair** are another anatomical focus: WSS’s hallmark “**hairy elbows**” (hypertrichosis cubiti) and generalized hypertrichosis indicate skin appendage (hair follicle) dysregulation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=spaced%20eyes%2C%20long%20eyelashes%2C%20wide,renal)). The **elbows** and distal limbs show this excessive hair growth, an unusual phenotype likely tied to ectodermal developmental pathways. The **heart (UBERON:0000948)** can be involved, as congenital heart defects (e.g. septal defects) are reported in some WSS cases ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)), implying that cardiac developmental genes (potentially regulated by histone methylation) are affected. The **kidneys (UBERON:0002113)** and **urogenital system** are occasionally involved (renal malformations, uterine anomalies in females) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)). Finally, the **endocrine system**, particularly the **pituitary gland (UBERON:0000007)**, may be anatomically small (hypoplastic) in some individuals with WSS who present with growth hormone deficiency ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=disorders,Otherwise%2C%20zebrafish)). In sum, WSS does not confine to a single organ – it spans multiple anatomical systems (brain, skeleton, integument, etc.), consistent with KMT2A’s role in regulating developmental genes across the body ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10941593/#:~:text=The%20KMT2A%20gene%20encodes%20a,anal%20fistula%20as%20a%20related)). 

### 3. Biological Processes (GO) Disrupted  
WSS disturbs several fundamental **biological processes**. The primary disruption is in **chromatin organization and modification** (GO:0016568) – specifically **histone H3-K4 methylation** and the downstream process of **transcriptional activation**. KMT2A is a “writer” that deposits H3K4 methylation marks associated with active genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3415539/#:~:text=Steiner%20syndrome%20%28WSS%29,anomaly%20syndromes%2C%20and%20further)). Consequently, **regulation of gene expression, DNA-templated** (GO:0010468) is impaired in WSS. Many genes that should be turned on at certain times or in certain tissues are insufficiently expressed, leading to cascading effects on cellular functions. For example, the misregulation of **HOX transcription factors** affects **anterior/posterior pattern specification** (GO:0009952) during embryogenesis, contributing to skeletal and craniofacial anomalies. Likewise, altered expression of CDKN1B/CDKN2C implicates processes like **cell cycle arrest** and **cell proliferation** (GO:0007050, GO:0042127) – consistent with observed growth deficiencies and possibly the pituitary hypoplasia (since cell proliferation in the pituitary may be reduced) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=disorders,Otherwise%2C%20zebrafish)). 

**Neurodevelopmental processes** are particularly impacted. Disruption in KMT2A’s function interferes with **neuronal differentiation** (GO:0030182) and **synapse formation**. Although the precise gene targets in neurons are still being characterized, KMT2A is known to regulate genes important for neuron morphogenesis and plasticity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=...10.1016%2Fj.celrep.2017.06.072.%20,14.Fahrner%20JA)). In WSS mouse models, loss of Kmt2a led to defective expression of genes involved in neuronal connectivity and autism-risk pathways, correlating with abnormal **learning or memory processes** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=demonstrated%20core%20features%20of%20WDSTS,candidate%20for%20future%20therapeutic%20strategies)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40956618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L130%20overlapping%20rescued,containing%20Kmt2a)). Thus, processes like **memory consolidation** and **synaptic transmission** are likely affected, explaining cognitive deficits. 

Additionally, **organ development (organogenesis)** processes are broadly perturbed. This includes **heart development** (GO:0007507), **kidney development** (GO:0001822), and **skeletal system development** (GO:0001501). Clinically, some WSS patients have congenital heart defects and kidney malformations ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)), suggesting that gene networks governing cardiogenesis and nephrogenesis (possibly involving transcription factors and signaling molecules) are improperly regulated. For instance, reduced SIX2 expression (a kidney developmental gene) may impair normal nephron formation, aligning with reported renal anomalies ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20target%20genes%20of,between%20control%20and%20KMT2A%20mutated)). Similarly, vertebral fusion anomalies in WSS ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)) point to disruptions in **somite segmentation** and **bone mineralization** processes (GO:0001503). 

**Metabolic and immune processes** can also be secondary affected processes. While WSS is not classically a metabolic disorder, the broad epigenetic dysregulation can impact metabolic gene expression in some tissues. Some patients exhibit feeding difficulties and failure to thrive ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12502264/#:~:text=observed%20phenotypes%20included%20failure%20to,1%2F10%29%20who%20had)), which may reflect underlying metabolic inefficiencies or endocrine problems (like growth hormone pathways). Immune system processes, such as **B cell differentiation** and **antibody production**, are involved in cases where immunodeficiency occurs ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27320412/#:~:text=Jones%20and%20co,%C2%A9%202016%20Wiley)). The KMT2A protein has known roles in hematopoietic stem cells, so its haploinsufficiency likely disrupts **hematopoiesis** (GO:0030097) and **immune response** pathways, consistent with observed low immunoglobulin levels and poor antibody responses in some individuals ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27320412/#:~:text=Jones%20and%20co,%C2%A9%202016%20Wiley)). 

In summary, WSS disrupts a network of biological processes centered on **epigenetic regulation of transcription**. This leads to downstream aberrations in developmental pathways (pattern formation, organ development), **cell cycle control**, **neurodevelopment**, and even **hormonal and immune system processes**. All these can be traced back to the failure of proper chromatin marking (H3K4 methylation) and the resultant mis-timing or mis-level of gene expression in development.

### 4. Cellular Components Involved  
At the subcellular level, KMT2A carries out its function in the context of specific **cellular components**. The primary location is the **cell nucleus (GO:0005634)**, where KMT2A associates with DNA and histone proteins. Within the nucleus, KMT2A is localized to **chromatin (GO:0000785)** – particularly at **promoter regions of DNA** within nucleosomes. The enzyme is part of large chromatin-bound complexes, so key cellular structures include the **nucleosome** (the DNA-histone unit) and **euchromatin regions** of the genome (where active gene transcription occurs). In WSS, due to certain mutations, the **subnuclear localization** of KMT2A can be altered – one study noted a mutant protein had a “disturbed subcellular distribution,” possibly indicating mislocalization away from chromatin foci ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=splice%20variant%20c.11322,different%20functional%20domains%20and%20suggested)). This suggests that normally KMT2A is found in specific nuclear compartments (e.g. at **transcription factories or nuclear subdomains**) and that mutation can shift it, perhaps into the nucleoplasm in a diffuse or aggregated form, impairing its function. 

The **COMPASS complex** that KMT2A belongs to is often recruited to **promoter chromatin** via DNA-binding motifs (like the CXXC domain that binds unmethylated CpG DNA) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=splice%20variant%20c.11322,different%20functional%20domains%20and%20suggested)). Therefore, the **promoter/enhancer regions** of target genes are critical cellular locales of action. KMT2A also interacts with general transcription machinery, so components like the **RNA polymerase II holoenzyme** and **transcriptional co-activator complexes** (e.g. the SEC – super elongation complex, in which wild-type MLL1 participates) are indirectly part of the functional cellular milieu affected by KMT2A haploinsufficiency. 

Beyond the nucleus, some effects of KMT2A loss might manifest in other cellular compartments secondarily. For example, neurons from WSS models may have abnormal **synaptic structures** (which are part of the **plasma membrane** and **postsynaptic density** compartments) as a downstream consequence of nuclear transcriptional changes. However, the pathology originates in the nucleus. There is no evidence that KMT2A localizes to mitochondria or other organelles, so the pathology is not believed to stem from those components. It is worth noting that KMT2A has multiple isoforms, and some isoforms might have differing nuclear vs. cytoplasmic distributions. But overall, **nuclear chromatin** is the key cellular component where WSS pathology is initiated. 

In patients, biopsied cell studies (e.g. fibroblast culture) show that KMT2A target gene repression is observed **in the nucleus**, consistent with a chromatin-based defect ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20target%20genes%20of,between%20control%20and%20KMT2A%20mutated)). On a tissue level, one could consider the **extracellular matrix** or structural components being affected indirectly (for example, poor bone matrix due to altered expression of collagen-modifying enzymes), but these effects are down-stream. The **pathophysiological locus is the genome within the nucleus** of developing cells, where KMT2A normally would tag histones. Thus, the cellular component annotation for WSS centers on the chromatin/nuclear environment – specifically, the **nucleosome (GO:0000786)** and **histone H3K4me3 marks** (which themselves can be considered part of chromatin components) that are deficient. 

### 5. Disease Progression  
**Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome is a congenital, static neurodevelopmental condition**, rather than a progressively degenerative disease. The pathogenic process begins very early – **from the embryonic stage**, when the zygote/embryo has only one functional KMT2A allele. During embryogenesis, as cells differentiate, the insufficient H3K4 methylation leads to subtle mis-regulation of developmental genes. This results in **abnormal patterning and organogenesis**: for instance, improper HOX gene expression can alter body segment development, contributing to vertebral and skeletal anomalies present at birth ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=hypertrichosis%20cubiti%20%28,renal)). Similarly, early brain developmental processes (neurogenesis and synapse formation) are affected, laying the ground for later intellectual disability. By the time of birth, many WSS features are already in place – babies may have low birth weight or length (reflecting prenatal growth restriction), distinctive facial dysmorphism, and possibly congenital malformations (like heart or kidney defects if they occurred) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)). Notably, hypertrichosis (excess hair) might not be obvious in the newborn but tends to develop in infancy or early childhood (hairy elbows typically become evident a bit later as the child grows) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=spaced%20eyes%2C%20long%20eyelashes%2C%20wide,renal)). 

Throughout infancy and early childhood, **developmental delays** become apparent. Milestones like sitting, walking, or talking can be delayed due to central nervous system effects. The **intellectual disability** in WSS ranges from mild to moderate; cognitive development plateaus at a lower level than peers. There is *no clear neurodegeneration* – rather, the neurodevelopment simply does not progress normally from the start. Many children require early intervention for speech and motor skills. Some features can evolve with age: for example, **growth deficiency** often persists, and without intervention, many affected children remain short in stature relative to age norms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12502264/#:~:text=observed%20phenotypes%20included%20failure%20to,1%2F10%29%20who%20had)). About half of patients are eventually diagnosed with **growth hormone (GH) deficiency**, which, if present, may further impede growth until treated ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=disorders,Otherwise%2C%20zebrafish)). Treatment with GH in childhood can improve linear growth, as reported in case series ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=Four%20patients%20had%20short%20stature%2C,retardation%2C%20intellectual%20delay%2C%20distinctive%20facial)), although it doesn’t change other aspects of WSS. 

Certain phenotypic aspects may emerge or be noticed later. **Hypertrichosis cubiti** (hairy elbows) tends to be a characteristic finding in childhood; it may lessen around puberty in some cases, but often patients continue to have more body hair than typical. **Behavioral issues** (if present, such as attention deficits or autistic features) might become more evident in school-age years, reflecting the underlying neurodevelopmental impact. **Epilepsy** has been reported in some individuals ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27320412/#:~:text=Jones%20and%20co,%C2%A9%202016%20Wiley)) – seizures, if they occur, often begin in childhood, though not all patients have epilepsy. **Immune dysfunction** (e.g. low immunoglobulins) would usually be recognized in early childhood due to recurrent infections ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27320412/#:~:text=Jones%20and%20co,%C2%A9%202016%20Wiley)); such patients might need immunoglobulin replacement or prophylactic antibiotics, and these immune issues can persist into later life if not treated ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Immune%20dysfunction%20%20,Family%2FCommunity)). 

As patients reach adolescence and adulthood, the syndrome’s features continue but may **stabilize**. Adults with WSS typically have the same core issues (intellectual disability, characteristic facial appearance, short stature) and do not develop new major symptoms related to the syndrome ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=,PubMed%3A%2030549396)). There is scant literature on **WSS in adulthood**, but available reports indicate that individuals can live into adulthood, and the dysmorphic features may become subtler with age while the cognitive and growth aspects remain ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=,PubMed%3A%2030549396)). Importantly, WSS itself is not known to reduce lifespan dramatically, especially with supportive care; many issues (feeding difficulties, heart defects) can be managed medically. The “progression” is thus more accurately the developmental trajectory: **initial insult in early development**, followed by lifelong manifestations without a degenerative course. That said, ongoing care is often needed for developmental disabilities. Recent data from a 2019 follow-up of adults indicate that endocrine issues like GH deficiency should be monitored, and some patients might have challenges with obesity or metabolic health in adulthood if diet and exercise are not managed (possibly due to reduced muscle tone and activity levels). 

Excitingly, **preclinical research suggests a developmental therapeutic window**. A 2025 study using a WSS mouse model demonstrated that if **Kmt2a function is restored in utero (mid-gestation)**, many neurological deficits can be prevented or “rescued” ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=demonstrated%20core%20features%20of%20WDSTS,candidate%20for%20future%20therapeutic%20strategies)). Specifically, by reactivating the silenced Kmt2a allele in embryonic neural progenitors, researchers normalized gene expression and the mice did not develop the typical memory and learning problems ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40956618/#:~:text=neurological%20phenotypes%20were%20rescued%20upon,the%20midpoint%20of%20in%20utero)). This finding implies that the disease process, at least for the brain, has a critical period: intervening before or during mid-gestational brain development can **halt the progression of neurological impairment** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40956618/#:~:text=neurological%20phenotypes%20were%20rescued%20upon,the%20midpoint%20of%20in%20utero)). In human terms, this raises the possibility that future therapies (such as in utero epigenetic or gene therapies) might alter the developmental course of WSS if applied very early. Currently, however, intervention is mainly postnatal and supportive, so the clinical course for patients is relatively set after birth. Going forward, the concept of a **“therapeutic window” before mid-gestation** offers hope that WSS progression could be modified for the next generation of patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=demonstrated%20core%20features%20of%20WDSTS,candidate%20for%20future%20therapeutic%20strategies)). 

### 6. Phenotypic Manifestations and Mechanistic Links  
WSS presents a distinct constellation of **clinical phenotypes** that reflect the underlying molecular defects in development. The **key manifestations** include developmental delay, intellectual disability, short stature, hypertrichosis (excess hair), characteristic facial dysmorphisms, and various organ anomalies ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=additional%20congenital%20anomalies,renal)). Each of these can be tied to the disruption of specific biological processes: 

- **Neurodevelopmental Impairment:** Virtually all individuals with WSS have **developmental delay** and later **intellectual disability** of varying degree ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12502264/#:~:text=observed%20phenotypes%20included%20failure%20to,1%2F10%29%20who%20had)). This is a direct outcome of the epigenetic dysregulation in the developing brain. Critical genes for neuron maturation, synaptic connectivity, and cognitive function are under-expressed. For example, KMT2A regulates a suite of genes important for learning and memory (some overlapping with autism spectrum disorder genes) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40956618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L130%20overlapping%20rescued,containing%20Kmt2a)). When these genes are not properly activated, it leads to deficits in neuronal circuit formation and plasticity. Clinically, this corresponds to delayed milestones (sitting, talking) and long-term cognitive impairment. Notably, **mouse models** support this connection: Kmt2a^+/− mice have **memory deficits and learning problems**, which were traced to dysregulated neuronal gene expression and could be rescued by restoring Kmt2a in neural cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=demonstrated%20core%20features%20of%20WDSTS,candidate%20for%20future%20therapeutic%20strategies)). Some WSS patients also exhibit **hypotonia** (low muscle tone) in infancy ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)), likely due to central neurological dysfunction as well as reduced muscle fiber growth, tying in the neuromotor aspects of the syndrome.

- **Short Stature and Growth Hormone Axis:** About 70–90% of WSS patients have **short stature or growth retardation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12502264/#:~:text=observed%20phenotypes%20included%20failure%20to,1%2F10%29%20who%20had)). This phenotype arises from both intrinsic growth plate abnormalities and endocrine dysfunction. KMT2A’s role in gene regulation extends to the pituitary gland and other growth-related tissues. Several patients have been found to have **growth hormone (GH) deficiency**, indicating that pituitary somatotroph cells might be underdeveloped or functioning suboptimally ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=disorders,Otherwise%2C%20zebrafish)). It’s hypothesized that KMT2A haploinsufficiency in pituitary progenitors leads to **pituitary hypoplasia**, reducing GH output ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=disorders,Otherwise%2C%20zebrafish)). One study noted *“WSS is associated with GH deficiency…, which hinders KMT2A histone lysine methyltransferase activity, thereby affecting gene transcription and cell proliferation, and may ultimately lead to pituitary hypoplasia”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=disorders,Otherwise%2C%20zebrafish)). This creates a vicious cycle: poor epigenetic regulation impairs pituitary growth, leading to low GH, which further compromises growth and possibly KMT2A activity in growth plates. Clinically, treating patients with rhGH often improves their height, confirming that part of the short stature is due to treatable hormonal insufficiency ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=Four%20patients%20had%20short%20stature%2C,retardation%2C%20intellectual%20delay%2C%20distinctive%20facial)). Additionally, direct effects on bones (through misregulation of **HOX genes and growth factor genes**) likely contribute to short stature and skeletal anomalies. For instance, some WSS patients have **vertebral fusion or scoliosis**, suggesting developmental patterning errors in the spine ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)).

- **Hypertrichosis (Excess Hair):** A hallmark of WSS is **hypertrichosis cubiti**, or “hairy elbows,” often accompanied by generalized hypertrichosis on the back and limbs ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=spaced%20eyes%2C%20long%20eyelashes%2C%20wide,renal)). About 60–100% of patients show this unusual phenotype ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=spaced%20eyes%2C%20long%20eyelashes%2C%20wide,renal)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12502264/#:~:text=observed%20phenotypes%20included%20failure%20to,1%2F10%29%20who%20had)). The mechanism is not fully understood, but it likely involves **ectodermal developmental pathways**. Hair growth patterns are regulated by a balance of signals for follicle activation vs. dormancy. KMT2A might control genes in dermal papilla cells or keratinocytes that keep hair growth in check in certain areas. When KMT2A is haploinsufficient, these genes (possibly inhibitors of hair follicle cycling) might be under-expressed, leading to excessive hair production. Interestingly, hypertrichosis is also seen in some other chromatinopathies, hinting that epigenetic regulation is important for hair follicle patterning. The “hairy elbows” are so distinctive that earlier it was considered pathognomonic for WSS ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=hypertrichosis%20cubiti%20%28,epilepsy%2C%20ophthalmologic%20anomalies%2C%20congenital%20heart)), and while we now know it’s not in every single case, its strong association highlights a link between KMT2A and skin appendage development. There is no specific treatment for the hypertrichosis beyond cosmetic hair removal; it is a benign but diagnostically useful trait. 

- **Facial Dysmorphism:** WSS patients have a recognizable **facial phenotype**: thick flared eyebrows, long eyelashes, hypertelorism (wide-spaced eyes), downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal tip, thin upper lip vermilion, and overall coarse facial features ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=additional%20congenital%20anomalies,hypotonia)). These traits indicate **craniofacial developmental abnormalities**. The midface and orbital development in embryogenesis is guided by neural crest cells and HOX/PAX gene networks, many of which are likely regulated by chromatin state. For example, improper timing of facial bone gene expression could result in the midface retrusion or nasal bridge differences seen in WSS. The fact that Kmt2a-deficient mice have craniofacial defects provides a direct parallel, strongly suggesting that the facial dysmorphisms stem from perturbed gene expression in cranial neural crest derivatives ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12581663/#:~:text=phenotype%20in%20WDSTS%20is%20treatable,candidate%20for%20future%20therapeutic%20strategies)). These dysmorphic features do not typically affect function (aside from possible dental misalignment or strabismus in some individuals), but they underscore the role of epigenetics in sculpting facial anatomy. 

- **Congenital Anomalies:** A subset of WSS individuals have **structural malformations** in various organs. Examples include **congenital heart defects** (such as septal defects or valve anomalies), **kidney malformations** (e.g. renal duplex system or calyceal dilatation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=familial%20hypertrichosis%20cubiti%20or%20,In%202000%2C%20Dr%20CE))), **genitourinary anomalies** (like uterine malformations), and **vertebral segmentation defects** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)). These malformations, though not present in every case, reveal that **organ-specific developmental programs** can be affected by KMT2A haploinsufficiency. For instance, heart development requires precise expression of transcription factors and signaling molecules (NKX2-5, TBX5, etc.), and subtle epigenetic dysregulation could lead to mild heart defects. Similarly, vertebral formation involves Hox gene segmental expression – disruption there aligns with the fusion anomalies noted in WSS ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Other%20clinical%20features%20include%20feeding,renal)). **Renal anomalies** might relate to downregulation of genes like SIX2 during kidney organogenesis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29203834/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20target%20genes%20of,between%20control%20and%20KMT2A%20mutated)). Though these anomalies vary widely, their presence in WSS (even if infrequent) highlights that no organ system is entirely spared from the effects of KMT2A-related dysregulation. Each anomaly can often be traced to embryologic development gone awry in the first trimester when those organs form. Management of these anomalies (surgery for heart defects, etc.) is part of WSS care, but recognizing their possibility is important for screening new patients. 

- **Immune Dysfunction:** Emerging evidence indicates some WSS patients have **immune system dysfunction**, particularly B-cell related. Cases of **hypogammaglobulinemia** (low IgG/IgA) and recurrent infections have been documented ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27320412/#:~:text=Jones%20and%20co,%C2%A9%202016%20Wiley)). In one report, a boy with WSS had such immunodeficiency alongside the typical WSS features, expanding the known phenotype ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27320412/#:~:text=Jones%20and%20co,%C2%A9%202016%20Wiley)). The mechanistic link here is that KMT2A plays a role in hematopoietic cell gene regulation (MLL/KMT2A was originally studied in leukemia biology). KMT2A likely regulates genes for B cell development (for example, it targets **MEIS1**, which is involved in hematopoiesis). Haploinsufficiency could impair the maturation of B lymphocytes or the class-switch recombination needed for normal antibody levels. This results in an immunodeficiency akin to Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) in some patients, with low immunoglobulins and poor response to infections ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27320412/#:~:text=complex%20phenotype%20overlapping%20WSS%20but,%C2%A9%202016%20Wiley)). For patients, this means unusual susceptibility to infections (especially sinopulmonary infections). The immune issues underscore that WSS is not purely neurodevelopmental but can affect the immune organ development (bone marrow, thymus). Treatment may involve immunoglobulin replacement and has to be managed by immunologists ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Immune%20dysfunction%20%20,Family%2FCommunity)). 

In conclusion, WSS manifests as a **multi-system developmental syndrome**. The unifying theme behind the phenotype is **global dysregulation of developmental genes** due to an epigenetic machinery defect. As one review succinctly noted, *“WSS is a chromatinopathy, exhibiting a diverse clinical phenotype that impacts multiple anatomical regions such as the head, skeleton, skin, and nervous system”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10941593/#:~:text=The%20KMT2A%20gene%20encodes%20a,anal%20fistula%20as%20a%20related)). The diverse clinical features – from hairy elbows to short stature to learning disability – all interconnect with the loss of KMT2A’s regulatory influence during development. Each phenotype, when mapped back, correlates with a known role of histone H3K4 methylation in controlling gene networks: brain development for cognition, endocrine axis for growth, ectodermal development for hair, and so on. By studying these manifestations, researchers continue to learn which gene pathways KMT2A governs. This not only helps in managing WSS (e.g., anticipating endocrine or immune problems) but also provides broader insight into how epigenetic regulation orchestrates human development. Future therapies may aim at **targeted epigenetic editing or gene therapy** to correct the root cause, but for now, clinicians address the phenotypes individually – developmental support for learning issues, growth hormone for short stature, and so forth ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12224386/#:~:text=Four%20patients%20had%20short%20stature%2C,retardation%2C%20intellectual%20delay%2C%20distinctive%20facial)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580718/#:~:text=Immune%20dysfunction%20%20,Family%2FCommunity)). WSS stands as a striking example of how a single gene encoding a chromatin regulator can have **ripple effects across the entire organism**, leading to a recognizable syndrome with varied but connected manifestations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10941593/#:~:text=The%20KMT2A%20gene%20encodes%20a,anal%20fistula%20as%20a%20related)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3415539/#:~:text=is%20predicted%20to%20result%20in,anomaly%20syndromes%2C%20and%20further)).
