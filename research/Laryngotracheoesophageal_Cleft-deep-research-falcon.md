Disease Pathophysiology Research Template

Target Disease
- Disease Name: Laryngotracheoesophageal Cleft (LTEC)
- MONDO ID: 
- Category: Complex

Pathophysiology description
Laryngotracheoesophageal cleft is a congenital foregut partitioning defect in which the posterior larynx/trachea remain abnormally continuous with the esophagus. Current developmental evidence indicates that proper separation of the anterior foregut into respiratory (ventral) and esophageal (dorsal) lineages requires tightly coordinated dorsoventral patterning of endoderm and splanchnic mesenchyme, mediated by reciprocal signaling between SHH/GLI, WNT/β-catenin, BMP (and its antagonist NOG), FGF, and retinoic acid pathways, and executed by transcription factors that assign dorsal esophageal identity (SOX2) and ventral respiratory fate (NKX2-1/TTF1). Disruption of these networks alters epithelial–mesenchymal growth and septation, leading to a spectrum of tracheoesophageal malformations that includes LTEC, esophageal atresia, and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2).

- Dorsal–ventral endodermal patterning. Dorsal foregut epithelium expresses SOX2 and ventral epithelium expresses NKX2-1; animal and human-pathology syntheses indicate that reduced SOX2 causes loss of dorsal identity (risking esophageal agenesis), whereas reduced NKX2-1 causes loss of ventral identity (tracheal agenesis). Ventral BMP4/SMAD activity suppresses SOX2 dorsoventrally; mesenchymal WNT2/2b instructs Nkx2-1 respiratory fate in the ventral foregut. These patterning programs are repeatedly cited as required for tracheo-esophageal separation (Orphanet J Rare Dis, Mar 2024, doi:10.1186/s13023-024-03106-z; Front Cell Dev Biol, Oct 2022, doi:10.3389/fcell.2022.1022457) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).
- Epithelial–mesenchymal crosstalk. Retinoic acid from mesoderm promotes endodermal SHH expression; SHH activates GLI2/GLI3 in mesenchyme to regulate WNT, BMP, and FGF10, coordinating mesenchymal differentiation (tracheal cartilage vs esophageal smooth muscle) with epithelial growth. RA–HH–WNT–BMP–FGF feedback ensures correct septation and branching; perturbations in any tier can yield foregut connection defects (Front Cell Dev Biol, 2022, doi:10.3389/fcell.2022.1022457; Laryngeal/vocal fold atlas, 2024) (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96, lunga2024cellularatlasof pages 92-96).
- Cell-type and timing context. Single-cell and cross-atlas analyses show that foregut malformation–associated genes are most enriched in lateral plate mesoderm at E8.75–E9.0 in mouse and in specific epithelial, fibroblast, and progenitor/basal cell subsets in human embryos, reinforcing that LTEC originates during the narrow window of foregut specification and septation (Scientific Reports, Feb 2024, doi:10.1038/s41598-024-53098-w) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2).
- Clinical correlation and spectrum. Case-level human data support the foregut maldevelopment origin of LTEC and its association with other foregut anomalies; for example, a type III LTEC presented with a gastric polypoid lesion comprised of bronchial-type respiratory epithelium/cartilage, interpreted as ectopic respiratory tissue arising from the same abnormal foregut developmental event (Surgical Case Reports, May 2023, doi:10.1186/s40792-023-01650-7) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 9-10).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Mechanistic synthesis distinguishing agenesis vs atresia. A 2024 rare-disease synthesis disentangles tracheal agenesis from atresia and re-emphasizes dorsoventral patterning/SOX2 vs NKX2-1 identity, BMP4/SMAD suppression of dorsal fate, and mesenchymal WNT2/2b induction of respiratory progenitors. It highlights compartmentalization via localized epithelial and mesenchymal proliferation along lateral mid-lines as a morphogenetic mechanism for separation (Orphanet J Rare Dis, Mar 2024, doi:10.1186/s13023-024-03106-z) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2).
- Single-cell resolution of risk loci and timing. A 2024 systems study maps 29 foregut malformation genes plus interactors, nominating FOXF1/FOXC1 and SOX2 across mouse/human datasets and pinpointing lateral plate mesoderm and early foregut endoderm as the most relevant lineages/stages (Sci Rep, Feb 2024, doi:10.1038/s41598-024-53098-w) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2).
- Laryngeal epithelial/mesenchymal lineage dynamics. A 2024 cellular atlas of laryngeal/vocal fold development records prominent Shh/Wnt/RA activity in early laryngeal embryogenesis, Shh peak around E11.5, and Gli2/3 expression within neural crest–derived mesenchyme—supporting the cross-talk model at the laryngeal end of the foregut (2024 atlas) (lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96, lunga2024cellularatlasof pages 92-96).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic framing and surgical planning leverage the shared developmental origin of LTEC with other foregut anomalies (TEF, atresia), informing comprehensive evaluation for associated malformations. In a 2023 case, recognition of aspiration and recurrent pneumonia prompted endoscopic diagnosis of a type III LTEC, guiding surgical timing and approach; histology of a concurrent gastric lesion confirmed ectopic respiratory (bronchial) tissue, underscoring global foregut patterning errors (Surgical Case Reports, May 2023, doi:10.1186/s40792-023-01650-7) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 9-10).
- Translational insight from patterning pathways. Clinical genetics increasingly screens patterning pathway genes and RA metabolism (e.g., ALDH1A2) in severe congenital anomaly syndromes; while not LTEC-specific, these data strengthen the rationale to consider RA–HH–WNT–BMP axes in diagnostic algorithms for complex foregut anomalies (contextualized in Front Cell Dev Biol 2022; Laryngeal atlas 2024) (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96, lunga2024cellularatlasof pages 92-96).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- “Dorsal expression of SOX2 and ventral expression of NKX2-1 establish patterning; reduced SOX2 causes loss of dorsal identity … while reduced NKX2-1 causes loss of ventral identity” and separation requires “compartmentalization with local proliferation of epithelial and mesenchymal cells along lateral mid-lines,” synthesizing animal and human findings (Orphanet J Rare Dis, 2024, doi:10.1186/s13023-024-03106-z) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2).
- Reviews emphasize that mesodermal RA induces endodermal SHH, which signals via GLI2/3 to modulate mesenchymal WNT/BMP/FGF10 and thereby epithelial–mesenchymal coordination for foregut morphogenesis; perturbations reactivate these pathways in disease (Front Cell Dev Biol, 2022, doi:10.3389/fcell.2022.1022457) (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).
- Cross-atlas integrative analyses nominate FOXF1/FOXC1 and SOX2 as top regulators in the key lineages/time windows for esophageal malformations, providing a cell-type–specific and temporal framework for hypothesis generation in LTEC (Sci Rep, 2024, doi:10.1038/s41598-024-53098-w) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- While LTEC incidence statistics were not reported in the retrieved 2023–2024 sources, the 2023 case report documents clinically relevant complications (frequent vomiting, aspiration pneumonia) and a confirmed type III LTEC on laryngoscopy at 30 days of life, with operative and histologic correlation (Surg Case Rep, May 2023, doi:10.1186/s40792-023-01650-7) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 9-10).

1. Core Pathophysiology
- Primary mechanisms: Failed foregut partitioning due to disrupted dorsoventral patterning of the anterior foregut epithelium and mesenchyme. SOX2 establishes dorsal esophageal identity; NKX2-1 establishes ventral respiratory identity. BMP4/SMAD suppresses SOX2 ventrally; mesenchymal WNT2/2b promotes Nkx2-1+ respiratory fate. RA induces endodermal SHH; SHH→GLI2/3 in mesenchyme modulates FGF10, WNT, BMP to coordinate growth, septation, and mesenchymal differentiation. Mispatterning yields persistent laryngo-tracheo-esophageal communication (LTEC) (Orphanet J Rare Dis 2024; Front Cell Dev Biol 2022) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).
- Dysregulated pathways: SHH/GLI, WNT/β-catenin (WNT2/2b), BMP (BMP4) with NOG antagonism, FGF (FGF10), Retinoic acid signaling. Single-cell/atlas work implicates FOXF1 and FOXC1 in mesenchymal programs (Sci Rep 2024; Laryngeal atlas 2024) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2, lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96, lunga2024cellularatlasof pages 92-96).
- Cellular processes affected: Endodermal fate specification, epithelial tube morphogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal signaling, mesenchymal patterning (cartilage vs smooth muscle), localized proliferation at separation planes (Orphanet J Rare Dis 2024; Front Cell Dev Biol 2022) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).

  - NKX2-1/TTF1 (ventral respiratory identity) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).
  - SHH; GLI2, GLI3 (endoderm→mesenchyme signaling axis) (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96, lunga2024cellularatlasof pages 92-96).
  - WNT2/2B and β-catenin pathway (mesenchyme→endoderm respiratory induction) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).
  - BMP4 and NOG (ventral BMP signaling and antagonism affecting SOX2; NOG misexpression linked to atresia in compiled evidence) (beuchat2025modélisationdelœsophage pages 73-76, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).
  - FOXF1/FOXC1 (mesenchymal SHH-responsive TFs implicated in lung/foregut malformations; enriched in EM gene sets) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).
  - FGF10 (mesenchymal mitogen regulated by SHH/RA/TGFβ programs, essential for bud growth) (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).
  - BARX1 (foregut mesenchymal TF that locally suppresses WNT to control septation) (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 11-11).
- Chemical entities (CHEBI): Retinoic acid (CHEBI:26538) as mesodermal morphogen; Vitamin A/retinol derivatives regulated by ALDH1A2 (contextual RA–HH link) (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, beuchat2025modélisationdelœsophage pages 73-76).
- Cell types (CL): Foregut endodermal epithelial progenitors; respiratory epithelial progenitors; splanchnic mesoderm/mesenchymal progenitors; neural crest–derived mesenchyme in larynx (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96, lunga2024cellularatlasof pages 92-96, maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2).
- Anatomical locations (UBERON): Anterior foregut (UBERON:0001040); larynx (UBERON:0001737); trachea (UBERON:0003126); esophagus (UBERON:0001043); tracheal mesenchyme; laryngeal mesenchyme (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96, lunga2024cellularatlasof pages 92-96).

3. Biological Processes (for GO annotation)
- Foregut morphogenesis; dorsal–ventral pattern specification; epithelial tube morphogenesis; epithelial cell fate commitment; regulation of Wnt signaling; Hedgehog signaling; retinoic acid biosynthetic process; epithelial–mesenchymal signaling; mesenchymal cell differentiation; trachea morphogenesis; larynx development (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 11-11).

4. Cellular Components
- Sites of action include: apical/basolateral plasma membrane signaling hubs in endodermal epithelium (WNT/BMP/SHH reception), ciliary structures in mesenchymal cells transducing SHH–GLI signaling, extracellular space and ECM where morphogens distribute; mesenchymal niches adjacent to the foregut tube where FOXF1/FOXC1 and FGF10 operate (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96).

5. Disease Progression (sequence of events)
- Initiation: During E8.75–E9.0 (mouse), RA primes endodermal SHH; dorsoventral patterning is established (SOX2 dorsal; NKX2-1 ventral) under BMP and WNT cues (Sci Rep 2024; Front Cell Dev Biol 2022) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).
- Partitioning/septation: Localized epithelial and mesenchymal proliferation along lateral mid-lines accomplishes separation; GLI2/3-driven mesenchymal programs regulate cartilage vs smooth muscle adoption; BARX1 locally suppresses WNT to allow septation (Orphanet J Rare Dis 2024; Front Cell Dev Biol 2022) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 11-11).
- Disruption: Altered dosage of SOX2 or NKX2-1, aberrant BMP/RA/WNT/SHH/FGF signaling, or mesenchymal TF (FOXF1/FOXC1) dysfunction leaves persistent communication across laryngo-tracheo-esophageal compartments (LTEC) with downstream aspiration and feeding complications (Orphanet J Rare Dis 2024; Surg Case Rep 2023) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 9-10).

6. Phenotypic Manifestations
- Key clinical phenotypes: Aspiration, recurrent pneumonia, dysphagia/feeding difficulties, respiratory distress; LTEC is frequently associated with additional foregut anomalies and, in syndromic contexts, broader cardio-craniofacial features. Case-level pathology has documented ectopic respiratory tissue in the stomach in association with LTEC, reflecting aberrant foregut patterning and migration (Surgical Case Reports, May 2023, doi:10.1186/s40792-023-01650-7) (maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 9-10). Developmental reviews add that TEF/atresia and congenital laryngeal webbing co-occur within this developmental field defect (2024 laryngeal atlas; Front Cell Dev Biol 2022) (lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3).

| NKX2-1 (TTF1) | Ventral respiratory fate TF / WNT-induced respiratory progenitor program | Specifies ventral respiratory identity (trachea/lung); loss reduces ventral identity leading to tracheal agenesis or failed separation. | Ventral foregut endoderm respiratory progenitors (CL: respiratory epithelial progenitors) | Trachea, larynx, lung primordium (UBERON: trachea, larynx, lung) | Pfeifer et al., Orphanet J Rare Dis 2024 (doi:10.1186/s13023-024-03106-z); Eenjes et al., Front Cell Dev Biol 2022 (doi:10.3389/fcell.2022.1022457); Maj et al., Sci Rep 2024 (doi:10.1038/s41598-024-53098-w) (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2) | Ventral foregut patterning; respiratory system development; epithelial cell differentiation |
| SHH / GLI2 / GLI3 axis | Hedgehog signaling pathway (SHH → GLI transcriptional effectors) | Endoderm-derived SHH signals to surrounding mesenchyme activating GLI2/3, which regulate mesenchymal factors (WNT, BMP, FGF10) that coordinate epithelial–mesenchymal interactions required for septation and cartilage/smooth muscle patterning. | Foregut endoderm (SHH-expressing) and splanchnic mesenchyme (CL: splanchnic mesoderm, mesenchymal progenitors) | Anterior foregut, tracheal mesenchyme, laryngeal mesenchyme (UBERON: anterior foregut, trachea) | Eenjes et al., Front Cell Dev Biol 2022 (doi:10.3389/fcell.2022.1022457); Lunga 2024 (cellular atlas) (eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, lunga2024cellularatlasofb pages 92-96) | Hedgehog-activated signaling; regulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation; epithelial–mesenchymal signaling during foregut development |
| WNT2 / WNT2B - β-catenin | WNT signaling / canonical β-catenin pathway | Mesenchymal WNT2/2b induce Nkx2-1+ respiratory progenitors and promote ventral respiratory fate; WNT activity interacts with BMP/RA/SHH to sculpt dorsal–ventral identity. | Splanchnic mesoderm and foregut endoderm progenitors (CL: splanchnic mesenchyme, endodermal progenitors) | Anterior foregut, prospective trachea (UBERON: anterior foregut, trachea) | Pfeifer et al., Orphanet J Rare Dis 2024; Eenjes et al., Front Cell Dev Biol 2022 (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3) | Regulation of canonical Wnt signaling; induction of respiratory progenitor fate; epithelial tube morphogenesis |
| BMP4 / NOG (Noggin) | BMP signaling (BMP4) and antagonist Noggin (TGF-β superfamily) | Ventral BMP4/SMAD signaling contributes to suppression of SOX2 ventrally; Noggin (BMP antagonist) misexpression perturbs foregut progenitor programming and can lead to atresia/failure of proper separation. | Foregut epithelium and adjacent mesenchyme (CL: foregut epithelium, mesenchymal progenitors) | Anterior foregut, esophagus/trachea junction (UBERON: anterior foregut, esophagus, trachea) | Literature syntheses and experimental reports cited in Beuchat/compiled review and Eenjes 2022 noting BMP4 effects and Noggin misexpression links (beuchat2025modélisationdelœsophage pages 73-76, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3) | Regulation of BMP-mediated signaling; negative regulation of epithelial differentiation; epithelial cell fate specification |

*Table: Compact reference table summarizing principal genes/pathways implicated in foregut partitioning and LTEC-related anomalies, with mechanistic roles, affected cell types and anatomical sites, evidence (recent sources/DOIs), and suggested GO biological processes for ontology mapping.*

Notes and limitations
- Human genotype–phenotype correlations specifically for LTEC remain sparse in the 2023–2024 sources retrieved here; however, the convergent developmental model and shared foregut field defects strongly support mechanistic extrapolation from TEF/EA and tracheal agenesis/atresia to LTEC. Where direct LTEC molecular pathology data are unavailable, we cite adjacent high-confidence mechanisms and cell-level atlases with explicit scope statements (pfeifer2024trachealagenesisversus pages 1-2, eenjes2022lungepitheliumdevelopment pages 1-3, maj2024singlecellanalysisreveals pages 1-2).
