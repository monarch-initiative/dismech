### 1. Core Pathophysiology  
Urticaria (hives) is fundamentally an immune-mediated **mast cell** disorder of the skin. The hallmark is activation and **degranulation** of dermal mast cells, leading to the rapid release of vasoactive mediators like **histamine**, which cause transient, localized edema (wheals) and erythema ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,lasting%20lesions)). Mast cells reside around superficial skin blood vessels and nerves; when triggered (by immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms), they release histamine, **platelet-activating factor (PAF)**, **leukotrienes**, **prostaglandins**, and cytokines that induce **vasodilation** and increase vascular permeability, allowing plasma to leak into tissues ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,lasting%20lesions)) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,13.%5E%7B1%7D%20These)). This process creates the characteristic *wheal-and-flare* lesion – a raised, blanching center (edema) with surrounding redness (flare) – and stimulates sensory nerves to produce **pruritus** (itch) ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,lasting%20lesions)). There is an immediate phase (<30 minutes) driven by histamine and lipid mediators, followed by a late phase (4–8 hours) of sustained inflammation due to cytokine release (e.g. **TNF**, **IL-4**, **IL-5**) which can prolong lesions ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,lasting%20lesions)). 

**Mast cells are the central effectors in urticaria**, but the upstream triggers of mast cell activation vary. In acute allergic urticaria, an external allergen cross-links allergen-specific **IgE** bound to mast cell FcεRI receptors (a classic type I hypersensitivity reaction), prompting degranulation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40845419/#:~:text=Mast%20cell%20activation%20and%20degranulation,synthesis%20of%20newly%20formed%20mediators)). In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), external triggers are absent and **autoimmune mechanisms** often drive mast cell activation ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=In%20CSU%2C%20an%20external%20trigger,17%20%2C%20%2024)). *“Previous studies have found that mast cell activation is the central link in the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria. Genetics, autoimmune, coagulation disorders, and infection may also be involved in the pathophysiological process… more immune and non-immune mechanisms have been gradually revealed, such as the interaction of immune cells in the microenvironment of urticaria, intestinal flora and metabolism, neuroimmunity, environmental factors and hormones.”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10929888/#:~:text=Chronic%20urticaria%20is%20very%20common,interaction%20of%20immune%20cells%20in)) This underscores that while mast cell degranulation is the final common pathway, multiple upstream factors (autoantibodies, complement, coagulation cascades, etc.) contribute to CSU’s complex pathobiology. 

**Autoimmune urticaria:** About half of CSU cases are thought to be autoimmune in origin ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=In%20CSU%2C%20an%20external%20trigger,17%20%2C%20%2024)). Two main autoimmune endotypes are recognized: **type I autoimmunity (autoallergic CSU)** and **type IIb autoimmunity (autoimmune CSU)** ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=In%20CSU%2C%20an%20external%20trigger,17%20%2C%20%2024)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=Subsequent%20advances%20led%20to%20the,32)). In *type I (autoallergic) CSU*, patients produce pathogenic IgE antibodies against self-antigens (*autoallergens*). These IgE autoantibodies bind to mast cell FcεRI, just like IgE against external allergens, and trigger chronic degranulation ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=involving%20either%20immunoglobulin%20G%20%28IgG%29,23%2C%2018)). Notably, IgE autoantibodies to thyroid antigens (e.g. **thyroid peroxidase**, TPO) and the cytokine **interleukin-24 (IL-24)** have been identified; *“IgE anti-IL-24 is present in approximately 70–80% of patients with CSU, and its serum concentration in patients correlates with disease activity”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=thyroglobulin%20,44)). This indicates that autoallergic IgE responses to endogenous proteins (such as IL-24 or TPO) can drive chronic hives. In *type IIb CSU*, patients harbor IgG (and occasionally IgM/IgA) autoantibodies targeting either the IgE antibody or the high-affinity IgE receptor **FcεRI** on mast cells and basophils ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=involving%20either%20immunoglobulin%20G%20%28IgG%29,23%2C%2018)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=with%20CSU%3A%20type%20I%20autoimmunity,32)). These IgG autoantibodies chronically activate mast cells through FcεRI signaling or by fixing **complement** on the mast cell surface ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=with%20CSU%3A%20type%20I%20autoimmunity,32)). Complement activation (classical pathway) releases **C5a**, an anaphylatoxin that can further induce mast cell and basophil degranulation via C5a receptors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=coupled%20receptor%20X2%20,4R%CE%B1)). Thus, type IIb autoimmunity leads to continuous mast cell stimulation by autoantibodies (often IgG_1/IgG_3), independent of IgE ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=with%20CSU%3A%20type%20I%20autoimmunity,32)). Patients with type IIb (IgG-mediated) urticaria tend to have more severe, refractory disease; *it is now known that patients with type IIb autoimmunity are more prone to develop long-standing disease* ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Although%20urticaria%20is%20a%20relatively,prone%20to%20develop%20long%20standing)) and have higher rates of concomitant autoimmune conditions (e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=CSU%20is%20also%20associated%20with,their%20presence%20on%20clinical%20evaluation)). Indeed, **antithyroid antibodies** (e.g. anti-thyroperoxidase or anti-thyroglobulin) are detected in ~27% of CSU patients ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=CSU%20is%20also%20associated%20with,their%20presence%20on%20clinical%20evaluation)), and *“the presence of thyroid autoantibodies supports the autoimmune process in CSU.”* ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=inflammation%20,Current%20international%20urticaria%20guidelines)) This association suggests a predisposition to autoimmunity, although thyroid autoantibodies themselves may not directly cause hives in most cases. Numerous other autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Sjögren’s, etc.) have been reported at higher frequency in CSU patients ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=CSU%20is%20also%20associated%20with,their%20presence%20on%20clinical%20evaluation)), reinforcing that loss of immune tolerance is an important theme in chronic urticaria pathogenesis. 

**Non-immunologic and adjunctive mechanisms:** In many CSU patients (including those without detectable autoantibodies), mast cells can also be activated through non-IgE pathways. One key pathway involves the mast cell’s Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor, **MRGPRX2**. Certain drugs (opioids, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, neuromuscular blockers) and neuropeptides (such as **substance P**) can directly activate skin mast cells via MRGPRX2, causing so-called *“pseudo-allergic” or neurogenic urticaria* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=Of%20growing%20interest%20is%20the,36%7D%20Its)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1243%20nerve%20endings,mast%20cells%20and%20peripheral%20sensory)). MRGPRX2 is highly expressed on skin mast cells and is **upregulated in patients with CSU**, especially in severe cases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=Of%20growing%20interest%20is%20the,36%7D%20Its)). As one article notes, *“MRGPRX2… is highly expressed in mast cells of patients with CSU and over-regulated in severe forms of the disease, participating in degranulation mechanisms called pseudoallergic/neurogenic.”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=Of%20growing%20interest%20is%20the,36%7D%20Its)) This receptor can be triggered by endogenous peptides (e.g. **VIP**, **cathelicidin LL-37**, eosinophil granule proteins) and stress-related neuropeptides, linking psychological stress or local neural reflexes to mast cell activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=%28MRGPRX2%29%20%20,37)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1243%20nerve%20endings,mast%20cells%20and%20peripheral%20sensory)). The result is mast cell degranulation independent of IgE. Additionally, **coagulation pathways** may play a role in amplifying urticarial inflammation: tissue injury or mast cell tryptase can activate the plasma kinin–coagulation cascade, generating **bradykinin** and fibrin by-products. Bradykinin is a potent vasoactive peptide that increases vascular permeability (similar to histamine). Elevated levels of cleaved high–molecular-weight kininogen (a marker of bradykinin release) have been observed in CSU patients during flares ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31899843/#:~:text=Results%3A%20One%20hundred%20seventeen%20samples,dependent%20on%20the%20presence%20of)), at levels comparable to hereditary angioedema, suggesting that the kallikrein–kinin system is transiently activated in chronic urticaria. This may contribute to severe episodes of **angioedema** or augment histamine-mediated leakage. Other factors such as **infection** and the **gut microbiome** have been investigated: chronic infections (H. pylori, hepatitis viruses, etc.) are associated with a minority of CSU cases ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=A%20variety%20of%20chronic%20infections,%5B22)), and dysbiosis of gut flora or metabolic changes might influence systemic immune tone ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10929888/#:~:text=or%20delayed%20treatment,interaction%20of%20immune%20cells%20in)). There is also evidence for **neuroimmune crosstalk** – stress and neural stimuli can trigger peripheral nerves to release substance P and **CGRP**, which in turn provoke mast cells (via MRGPRX2 and NK-1 receptors) and amplify inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1243%20nerve%20endings,mast%20cells%20and%20peripheral%20sensory)). In summary, while the final pathway in urticaria is mast cell degranulation in the skin, this can be instigated by diverse mechanisms: classical allergen/IgE binding, IgE or IgG autoantibodies, complement activation, direct mast cell agonists, or even coagulation and neural pathways. Chronic urticaria is thus a complex interplay of the **immune system**, **skin microenvironment**, and sometimes systemic factors.

### 2. Key Molecular Players  
- **Genes/Proteins:**  *FCER1A* – high-affinity IgE receptor α chain on mast cells and basophils (central to degranulation; target of IgG autoantibodies in type IIb autoimmune urticaria) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=with%20CSU%3A%20type%20I%20autoimmunity,32)). *IGH (IGHE)* – immunoglobulin heavy chain ε gene encoding **IgE**; IgE antibodies (including autoallergic IgE) bind FcεRI and trigger mast cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=with%20CSU%3A%20type%20I%20autoimmunity,32)). *IL24* – **interleukin-24**, a cytokine recently identified as a common autoallergen in CSU (~70% of patients have IgE anti-IL-24) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=thyroglobulin%20,44)). *TPO* – **thyroid peroxidase**, a self-antigen (thyroid enzyme) implicated as an IgE autoallergen in some CSU cases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=Type%20I%2FaaUCE%20is%20inherent%20in,44)); IgE anti-TPO can activate basophils in vitro, linking thyroid autoimmunity to hives. *KIT* – mast cell growth factor receptor (c-Kit); essential for mast cell development and survival. *C5AR1* – **C5a receptor**; expressed on mast cells and basophils, triggers degranulation in response to complement C5a ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=coupled%20receptor%20X2%20,4R%CE%B1)). (A genetic polymorphism in *C5AR1* (–1330T) has been associated with increased CSU susceptibility ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10929888/#:~:text=%CE%B1%E5%88%86%E6%B3%8C%E3%80%82%E8%A1%A5%E4%BD%93C5a%E5%8F%97%E4%BD%931%28complement%20component%205a%20receptor%201%EF%BC%8CC5AR1%29,70%5D%7D%EF%BC%8C%E8%A1%A8%E6%98%8E%E8%A1%A8%E8%A7%82%E9%81%97%E4%BC%A0%E5%AD%A6%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E5%8F%82%E4%B8%8ECSU%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%91%E7%94%9F%E5%92%8C%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%E3%80%82miRNA)).) Other cytokines implicated include *IL4*, *IL5*, *IL13*, *IL6*, *TNF* – produced by Th2 cells and mast cells, they perpetuate inflammation and IgE production ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,13.%5E%7B1%7D%20These)). Elevated *IL-6* and *TNF* levels are often found in active CSU lesions, reflecting an ongoing immune response.  

- **Chemical Entities:**  **Histamine** – the principal mediator of urticaria (a biogenic amine stored in mast cell granules) ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,lasting%20lesions)). Histamine binds H1 receptors on endothelium causing vasodilation and endothelial junction opening, leading to plasma leakage (edema), and stimulates H1 receptors on nerves causing itch ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,lasting%20lesions)). **Leukotrienes** (e.g. LTC₄, LTD₄) – lipid mediators synthesized from mast cell arachidonic acid; they prolong increases in vascular permeability and can cause bronchospasm. **Prostaglandin D₂** – another mast cell-derived lipid mediator, causes vasodilation and recruits immune cells. **Platelet-activating factor (PAF)** – a phospholipid mediator released by mast cells; highly vasoactive and chemotactic, implicated in severe urticaria ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,13.%5E%7B1%7D%20These)). **Bradykinin** – a vasoactive peptide generated via plasma kallikrein; contributes to angioedema by increasing vascular permeability. Studies show bradykinin-forming activity is elevated during CSU flares ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31899843/#:~:text=Results%3A%20One%20hundred%20seventeen%20samples,dependent%20on%20the%20presence%20of)), suggesting it has a role in the swelling (especially in deeper tissues). **Complement fragments** (C5a, C3a) – anaphylatoxins that can directly trigger mast cells; C5a in particular is a bridge between complement activation and histamine release in autoimmune urticaria ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=coupled%20receptor%20X2%20,4R%CE%B1)). **Eosinophil granule proteins** (e.g. major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein) – released by eosinophils in lesions; these can cause additional mast cell activation and tissue damage. **Neuropeptides** (Substance P, CGRP) – released from cutaneous nerves under stress or physical stimuli; they bind mast cell receptors (MRGPRX2 or NK-1) and can provoke neurogenic inflammation (wheals exacerbated by stress) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1243%20nerve%20endings,mast%20cells%20and%20peripheral%20sensory)).  

- **Cell Types:**  **Mast cells** – the primary effector cells in urticaria ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,that)). These tissue-resident granulocytes (CL:0000097) release histamine and other mediators upon activation, directly causing the wheals and angioedema. **Basophils** – circulating granulocytes with similar IgE receptors; in CSU they show reduced count (basopenia) due to activation and tissue recruitment ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=Different%20authors%20have%20described%20the,peripheral%20blood%20of%20these%20patients)). Basophils can release histamine and IL-4, and are also triggered by autoantibodies in type IIb CSU ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=involving%20either%20immunoglobulin%20G%20%28IgG%29,23%2C%2018)). **CD4⁺ T cells** – especially **Th2 cells**, which produce IL-4, IL-13, IL-5 that support IgE production and eosinophil activation ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,13.%5E%7B1%7D%20These)). Th2-polarized T cells are often found in urticarial lesions (Th2 > Th1/Th17) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,13.%5E%7B1%7D%20These)) and may drive the allergic/autoinflammatory milieu. **B cells and plasma cells** – source of IgE and IgG autoantibodies; in CSU, autoreactive B cells (e.g. against IL-24 or thyroid antigens) underlie the autoantibody production. **Eosinophils** – frequent in chronic urticaria skin biopsies, especially in more severe cases ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,13.%5E%7B1%7D%20These)). They release inflammatory mediators (MBP, ECP) that can further degranulate mast cells and cause tissue edema; eosinophil enzymes (e.g. peroxidase) might also serve as autoantigens (IgE autoantibodies against eosinophil peroxidase have been reported ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=Type%20I%2FaaUCE%20is%20inherent%20in,44))). **Neutrophils** – present in a subset of lesions (termed neutrophil-rich urticaria); they release proteases (e.g. MMP-9) and reactive oxygen species, contributing to tissue injury and vasodilation. Neutrophilic urticaria is often more refractory and may indicate underlying systemic inflammation. **Monocytes/Macrophages** – occasionally infiltrate lesions; they can produce cytokines (IL-6, IL-1) and aid in tissue remodeling. **Endothelial cells** – though not immune cells, they are key targets of mast cell mediators. Endothelial cells lining dermal venules respond to histamine (via H1 receptors) by contracting and separating at junctions, allowing fluid and cells to extravasate. They also upregulate adhesion molecules to recruit leukocytes. **Sensory nerve fibers** – C-fiber neurons in the skin that carry itch signals. They express H1/H4 and NK-1 receptors; histamine and substance P from urticaria lesions activate these nerves, causing itching and neurogenic flare. Nerves also release neuropeptides that feed back to mast cells, creating a positive feedback loop in chronic urticaria ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1243%20nerve%20endings,mast%20cells%20and%20peripheral%20sensory)).  

- **Anatomical Locations:**  **Skin (cutaneous tissues)** – the primary site of urticarial pathology (UBERON:0002097). Wheals can occur on any skin surface, often appearing on the trunk, limbs, or neck. The **superficial dermis** is where the edema of hives forms, as fluid extravasates around superficial **post-capillary venules** ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,that)). *“Urticaria is primarily mediated by dermal and subcutaneous skin mast cells, along with perivascular (around small skin venules) and perineural cellular infiltrate.”* ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,10%7D%20Activated%20MCs)) Thus, the **dermal microvasculature** and surrounding connective tissue are central in lesion formation. In **angioedema**, the swelling extends deeper into the **subcutis** or submucosa (e.g. lips, eyelids), reflecting similar processes acting on deeper vessels ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,that)). **Perivascular spaces** in the dermis become filled with serum and inflammatory cells during a wheal. **Perineural areas** (around cutaneous nerves) are often sites where mast cells cluster, which may explain the neurally mediated components of urticaria (itch and stress-induced flares) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,10%7D%20Activated%20MCs)). No internal organs are directly affected in ordinary urticaria, but in severe episodes or cholinergic urticaria, widespread vasodilation can cause hypotension (as part of anaphylaxis). Importantly, urticaria lesions are transient with no permanent tissue damage to the skin – the edema resolves without scarring once mediators subside. (In contrast, chronic *urticarial vasculitis*, a different entity, involves small-vessel inflammation with lasting lesions.) 

### 3. Biological Processes (GO)  
- **Mast cell activation & degranulation:** The pivotal event in urticaria is mast cell activation, which can occur via immunologic triggering (FcεRI aggregation by antigen–IgE complexes) or non-immunologic stimuli (MRGPRX2 agonists, etc.). Activated mast cells undergo exocytosis of granules (*degranulation*), releasing preformed inflammatory mediators into the tissue ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,lasting%20lesions)). This process (GO:0043303) is the effector phase that produces the wheal. 

- **FcεRI signaling pathway:** The high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) signaling cascade is a key upstream process. When an allergen or autoantigen cross-links IgE bound to FcεRI on mast cells, it triggers a tyrosine kinase cascade (Lyn, Syk, **Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK)**, etc.), calcium influx, and activation of phospholipase Cγ, leading to granule release and synthesis of lipid mediators ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40845419/#:~:text=reactions%20outside%20the%20context%20of,synthesis%20of%20newly%20formed%20mediators)). This IgE-dependent signaling underlies both classical allergic urticaria and the autoallergic (type I) CSU endotype. Consistently, blocking IgE–FcεRI interactions (e.g. with omalizumab) can halt this pathway and resolve symptoms in many patients. 

- **Complement activation:** In autoimmune CSU (type IIb), IgG antibodies form immune complexes on the mast cell surface and activate the classical complement pathway. **Complement C5** is cleaved, releasing **C5a**, which binds to C5a receptors on mast cells and basophils to induce further degranulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=coupled%20receptor%20X2%20,4R%CE%B1)). This complements (pun intended) the direct action of the autoantibodies. Complement activation (GO:0006956) amplifies inflammation by recruiting leukocytes and increasing vascular permeability. Elevated serum C5a and C5aR-positive cell infiltrates are reported in severe CSU, supporting the role of this process. 

- **Inflammatory cytokine production:** Beyond immediate histamine release, mast cells and Th2 cells in urticaria produce cytokines that sustain inflammation (GO:0001816). For example, mast cells secrete **TNFα**, **IL-4**, **IL-5**, **IL-8 (CXCL8)** hours after degranulation ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,lasting%20lesions)). IL-4 and IL-5 promote *IgE* production and *eosinophil* recruitment, respectively, creating a positive feedback loop for allergic inflammation. **IL-6** from mast cells or monocytes can drive acute phase responses and endothelial activation. These cytokines prolong the urticarial reaction beyond the initial 1–2 hours and can cause late-phase swelling or flare. Chronic urticaria lesions show an influx of **T cells**, **eosinophils**, and **neutrophils** driven by such cytokine and chemokine signals ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,13.%5E%7B1%7D%20These)). 

- **Leukocyte chemotaxis and activation:** Chemokines and secondary mediators released in urticaria guide additional immune cells into the skin (GO:0050900). For instance, mast cell-derived **CCL2 (MCP-1)** and **CXCL8 (IL-8)** attract monocytes and neutrophils; **eotaxins** and IL-5 recruit **eosinophils**. Once present, these cells become activated: eosinophils release toxic granule proteins (e.g. MBP, ECP) that can further injure endothelium and stimulate mast cells, while neutrophils release **proteases** (e.g. elastase, MMP-9) that increase vascular leakage by degrading extracellular matrix and cleaving cell junctions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10929888/#:~:text=match%20at%20L365%20angioedema%3A%20an,adenosine%20is%20linked%20to%20disease)). This coordinated cellular infiltration contributes to more severe or persistent lesions and is especially prominent in chronic autoimmune urticaria ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,13.%5E%7B1%7D%20These)). 

- **Regulation of vascular permeability:** The process of **plasma extravasation** (GO:0043114) underlies the formation of urticarial wheals. Histamine and PAF cause **endothelial cells** to contract and separate at their tight junctions, increasing capillary permeability within minutes ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,that)). This allows fluid, plasma proteins, and small molecules to leak into the interstitial space of the dermis, forming the characteristic **edema** of hives. Simultaneously, vasodilation (widening of arterioles) occurs via H1-receptor mediated endothelial nitric oxide release, leading to the redness (flare) surrounding a wheal. The degree of permeability change determines the size of the wheal; in angioedema, permeability increases in deeper vessels as well, causing more diffuse, ill-defined swelling. The body normally counter-regulates this – e.g. epinephrine or adrenergic signals tighten endothelial junctions – but in urticaria the pro-permeability signals predominate until mediators dissipate or are blocked (e.g. by antihistamines). 

- **Neuroimmune signaling:** There is a bidirectional interplay between the nervous system and immune processes in urticaria. Cutaneous nerve activation (GO:0023019 signaling) by histamine leads to itch sensation and neurogenic inflammation (vasodilation via axon reflex). Conversely, stress or physical stimuli can cause peripheral nerves to release neuropeptides (substance P, CGRP) that act on mast cells (via NK1R and MRGPRX2) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1243%20nerve%20endings,mast%20cells%20and%20peripheral%20sensory)). This neuroimmune loop can exacerbate urticaria in response to heat, exercise, or stress (as seen in cholinergic urticaria and stress-induced flares). Thus, processes like **“response to stress”** and **“neuropeptide signaling”** are also relevant, although they are secondary modulators of the core mast cell response. 

### 4. Cellular Components (subcellular/localization)  
- **Mast cell secretory granules:** These are membrane-bound cytoplasmic granules that store preformed mediators (histamine, heparin, tryptase, etc.). Upon mast cell activation, granule membranes fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents (exocytosis) ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,that)). The granules’ contents diffuse into the extracellular space in the dermis, initiating the wheal/flare response. Granule exocytosis is visible ultrastructurally as the classical “piecemeal degranulation” or complete emptying in activated mast cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40845419/#:~:text=Mast%20cell%20activation%20and%20degranulation,synthesis%20of%20newly%20formed%20mediators)). 

- **Plasma membrane receptors:** Key signaling components are localized to the mast cell surface. The **high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI)** is a tetrameric receptor complex on the plasma membrane that when aggregated initiates intracellular signaling for degranulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=with%20CSU%3A%20type%20I%20autoimmunity,32)). Similarly, **MRGPRX2** is a G-protein coupled receptor embedded in the mast cell membrane; it can be on the cell surface or endosomal compartments and triggers Ca²⁺-dependent degranulation when ligands (drug molecules, neuropeptides) bind ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=match%20at%20L873%20the%20development,subsequent%20degranulation%20and%20further%20cytokine)). **C5a receptors (C5AR1)** on mast cell and basophil membranes bind the complement fragment C5a and are another surface trigger for release ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=coupled%20receptor%20X2%20,4R%CE%B1)). In target cells (endothelia, nerves, etc.), membrane receptors mediate the response to mast cell mediators: e.g. **H1 histamine receptors** on endothelial cell membranes cause changes in the cytoskeleton that open intercellular junctions; H1 receptors on sensory neuron membranes initiate nerve firing (itch). 

- **Endothelial junctions and basement membrane:** In dermal microvessels, endothelial cells are connected by tight and adherens junction proteins (e.g. VE-cadherin). These junctional complexes are part of the cellular component that gets disrupted by urticarial mediators. When histamine binds endothelial H1 receptors, intracellular calcium rises in the endothelial cell, causing **contraction of actin–myosin** and gap formation between cells. The **basement membrane** underlying the endothelium normally acts as a filter; however, in urticaria, increased hydrostatic pressure and enzymatic degradation (by proteases like tryptase and MMP-9) make the basement membrane leaky, permitting plasma and cells to pass into the dermis. Fibrin deposition is occasionally noted, indicating that the basement membrane and extracellular matrix are involved in the leakage and clotting that occur in lesional skin. 

- **Perivascular and perineural spaces:** These are anatomical microenvironments but can be considered the “site of action” for released mediators. Mast cells often reside in **perivascular spaces** – immediately adjacent to post-capillary venules in the dermis – and in **perineural locations** – near small cutaneous nerves ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,10%7D%20Activated%20MCs)). Thus, when mast cell granules release contents, the *extracellular space* around blood vessels and nerves is where mediators like histamine, bradykinin, and substance P exert their effects. Edema fluid accumulates in the loose connective tissue of these spaces. In urticaria, one can think of the *dermal interstitium* (particularly around vessels) as a compartment that swells due to endothelial leak. This space is also where incoming inflammatory cells migrate and where complement components diffuse. 

- **Immunological synapses:** Although not a classical organelle, points of contact between immune cells are important in CSU. For example, the interaction between activated **T cells** and **B cells** (in lymphoid tissue or perhaps in spleen/lymph nodes) leads to the class-switching and production of IgE autoantibodies (this involves cell-surface molecules like CD40/CD40L, IL-4 receptor, etc.). In lesions, contacts between mast cells and nerves (sometimes termed “neuromuscular junction–like” contacts) and between mast cells and eosinophils/basophils occur, allowing localized cell-to-cell signaling. These contact sites can be viewed as transient cellular microenvironments essential for orchestrating the chronic inflammatory response. (For instance, eosinophils can bind to mast cells via integrins and release MBP directly onto them, which can be considered a localized intercellular interaction site.)  

### 5. Disease Progression  
Urticaria can be conceptualized in phases, although not as clearly demarcated as some diseases. The **initiating phase** depends on the subtype: in IgE-mediated acute urticaria, initial *sensitization* to an allergen occurs (production of IgE by B cells under T-cell help), then upon re-exposure, the allergen rapidly triggers mast cells to degranulate within minutes, causing immediate hives. In chronic urticaria, an initial trigger may be less obvious; it could involve the spontaneous development of autoantibodies (IgG or IgE) or mast cell hyper-responsiveness. This might be precipitated by an infection or other stressors in some cases, breaking tolerance and leading to autoimmunity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10929888/#:~:text=or%20delayed%20treatment,interaction%20of%20immune%20cells%20in)). Once the pathogenic antibodies or aberrant mast cell signaling pathways are established, the disease enters an **active phase**. The active phase of chronic spontaneous urticaria is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheals (and often angioedema) occurring frequently (almost daily or at least weekly) for **6 weeks or longer** ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20generally%20classified%20as,heat%2C%20sunlight%2C%20vibration%20and%20pressure)). During this phase, mast cells remain primed and hypersensitive; even minor stimuli (exercise, heat, stress, or slight pressure on the skin) might provoke degranulation. Patients often have fluctuating disease activity, with periods of relative quiescence and periods of exacerbation. Flares can last several hours to days, and individual lesions typically appear and resolve within 24 hours ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20a%20common%20disorder%2C,10)), only to recur elsewhere. 

If an underlying autoimmune endotype is present, the disease progression can be more **persistent and severe**. For example, patients with IgG anti-FcεRI (type IIb CSU) often have hives and swelling that respond poorly to antihistamines and require advanced therapies; their disease might continue unabated for many months or years until the autoantibodies diminish. By contrast, patients with idiopathic (non-autoimmune) CSU or inducible urticaria may experience more intermittent disease and can sometimes identify and avoid triggers (e.g. cooling the skin to prevent cholinergic urticaria flares). Over time, many cases of chronic urticaria will enter a **resolution phase**. Spontaneous remission is reported in a significant fraction of patients as years pass – about 50% of CSU cases remit within 1–5 years, though others relapse or persist longer ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20a%20morbid%20condition%2C,So%2C%20we%20should%20treat%20urticarias)). One study noted most chronic urticaria cases last between 1 and 4 years, whereas physical urticarias (like dermographism) tend to endure longer (5–12 years on average) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20a%20morbid%20condition%2C,So%2C%20we%20should%20treat%20urticarias)). The **mechanism of remission** is not fully understood; it may involve the natural waning of autoantibody production or restoration of immune tolerance, as well as replacement of hyperactive mast cell populations. Some patients experience a stepwise improvement (less frequent or less intense hives over time), while others have an abrupt cessation of symptoms. 

Throughout disease progression, external factors can modulate the course. Stress and hormonal changes (e.g. pregnancy, thyroid dysfunction) can exacerbate hives in predisposed individuals, possibly by lowering the threshold for mast cell activation. Concurrent infections or inflammation might temporarily worsen urticaria due to broadly heightened immune activity. These influences do not necessarily change the fundamental mechanism but can push a subclinical condition into active flaring. There are no universally recognized “stages” of urticaria (unlike, say, cancer stages), but clinicians do distinguish **acute urticaria** (<6 weeks, often self-limited) from **chronic urticaria** (≥6 weeks) as a pivotal time-based progression ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20generally%20classified%20as,heat%2C%20sunlight%2C%20vibration%20and%20pressure)). In chronic cases, one can further categorize patients by **disease endotype**: e.g. autoimmune vs idiopathic. This has practical implications, as autoimmune (especially type IIb) urticaria often requires more aggressive or targeted therapy and tends to run a longer course ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Although%20urticaria%20is%20a%20relatively,prone%20to%20develop%20long%20standing)). By recognizing the endotype, clinicians can anticipate the potential chronicity and choose appropriate interventions (e.g. omalizumab for autoallergic IgE-mediated CSU, or immunosuppressants for severe IgG-mediated CSU). 

In summary, urticaria progression typically starts with an initial immune dysregulation (allergic sensitization or autoimmunity) leading to mast cell priming, followed by a chronic active phase with recurrent mediator release in the skin, and eventually a resolution in which immune activation wanes. Many patients have a remission within a few years; however, a subset (especially with autoimmune urticaria) can have a protracted relapsing course spanning many years ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20a%20morbid%20condition%2C,So%2C%20we%20should%20treat%20urticarias)). Even in remission, some individuals retain a tendency for urticarial reactions under extreme provocation (e.g. severe stress or infection), indicating an enduring hyper-reactivity that slowly normalizes. Importantly, chronic urticaria is not typically progressive in the sense of causing escalating permanent damage – instead its “progression” is a pattern of recurring reversible episodes, which either resolve spontaneously or with treatment intervention.

### 6. Phenotypic Manifestations  
Clinically, urticaria is characterized by **transient, itchy wheals** on the skin, often accompanied by **angioedema**. A wheal (hive) is a raised, circumscribed area of edema with an erythematous (red) rim and a pale center, usually appearing and disappearing within hours. *“Urticaria is a common disorder characterized by recurrent, pruritic (itchy) lesions with pale centers (wheals) that usually subside within 24–48 hours”* ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=,can%20be%20associated%20with%20angioedema)) ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20a%20common%20disorder%2C,10)). The wheals can range from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter and tend to be oval or map-like in shape; they blanch under pressure. **Pruritus** (itch) is a prominent symptom and can be intense, caused by histamine and other pruritogens activating cutaneous nerve endings ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20the%20primary,lasting%20lesions)). Patients often describe worse itching at night or with warmth (due to increased blood flow). Scratching the skin may provoke new hives via the Koebner phenomenon (also known as dermographism if linear). Angioedema is a deeper swelling of the subcutaneous or submucosal tissue, often affecting the eyelids, lips, face, distal extremities, or genitalia. It may occur with or without urticarial wheals. In histamine-mediated angioedema (as seen in chronic urticaria), there is frequently itch or a burning sensation and it resolves within 24–48 hours; in contrast, bradykinin-mediated angioedema (as in C1-inhibitor deficiency) is typically painful, non-itchy, and more prolonged. In chronic urticaria, about **40–60%** of patients experience angioedema at some point ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=millimeters%20to%20several%20centimeters%20in,5)), which can cause disfigurement (e.g. periorbital swelling) and discomfort, but usually no lasting harm. 

Urticarial lesions can appear anywhere on the skin surface. Common sites include the trunk, arms, legs, and face, but lesions are often widespread and migratory. Individual wheals tend to last <1 day at a given spot, but new wheals can continuously erupt in different locations day after day. The total daily hive count can vary from just a few isolated lesions to dozens covering large areas. Lesions often worsen in the evening or with heat. One distinguishing feature is the *evanescent* nature of hives – they leave no scars or pigmentation changes once resolved (though persistent scratching may cause transient post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or excoriations). Urticaria is essentially a clinical syndrome, and diagnosis is made by recognition of these typical lesion characteristics and temporal pattern. 

There are several phenotypic subtypes of urticaria:  
- **Acute urticaria:** hives lasting <6 weeks, often with an identifiable trigger such as a food allergy, drug reaction, or infection. Lesions can be extensive, sometimes accompanied by systemic anaphylactic symptoms if allergen exposure is large. Acute urticaria is typically self-limited once the trigger is removed.  
- **Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU):** hives (often with angioedema) recurring almost daily for >6 weeks with no consistent external trigger. This is the classic chronic “idiopathic” urticaria described above, which is frequently autoimmune in nature. Patients have ups and downs in hive severity, and the disease impacts quality of life due to unpredictability and persistent itch ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20a%20morbid%20condition%2C,So%2C%20we%20should%20treat%20urticarias)). They may have periods of remission and relapse. Thyroid autoimmunity or other autoimmune markers may be present.  
- **Chronic inducible urticaria:** a group of physical urticarias and other stimulus-provoked urticarias. In these, lesions are reliably triggered by specific environmental or physical factors. For example, **dermographism** (also called urticaria factitia) is elicited by mechanical stroking or scratching of the skin – within minutes, linear wheals appear at the scratched sites. **Cold urticaria** is triggered by cold exposure (e.g. ice, cold air or water) – affected skin develops red, swollen hives upon re-warming. **Cholinergic urticaria** is triggered by elevated core body temperature (exercise, hot showers, stress), producing numerous small (2–3 mm) hives with a surrounding flush. Other inducible types include **solar urticaria** (triggered by UV or visible light), **heat urticaria**, **vibratory urticaria**, and **delayed pressure urticaria** (swelling hours after sustained pressure on skin). In these subtypes, the phenotype is tied to the trigger: e.g. dermatographic urticaria features linear wheals, pressure urticaria causes deep swelling at pressure sites (soles, waist under tight belt), etc. Mechanistically, physical forces or stimuli cause mast cell degranulation often through localized release of neuropeptides or direct activation (in some cases via MRGPRX2). Inducible urticarias may coexist with CSU.  

Beyond the skin signs, **systemic symptoms** are typically absent in ordinary chronic urticaria. Patients are generally not ill (no fever or internal organ involvement solely from chronic hives). However, the chronic itch and visible welts significantly affect patients’ **quality of life**. Sleep disturbance from nighttime itching is common, and patients often report anxiety, depression, or social embarrassment. One study highlighted that *urticaria is a morbid condition, adversely affecting the patient’s quality of life*, especially when wheals are persistent ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20a%20morbid%20condition%2C,So%2C%20we%20should%20treat%20urticarias)). Unlike anaphylaxis, chronic urticaria does not usually progress to life-threatening reactions (except in rare instances where severe hives overlap with anaphylactic triggers). Patients with CSU do have higher rates of other allergic conditions (like sinusitis or atopic dermatitis) and autoimmune conditions, which can contribute to overall morbidity. 

In summary, the phenotype of urticaria is defined by **episodic, short-lived, pruritic wheals and/or deeper swellings**. These clinical manifestations are direct reflections of the underlying pathophysiology: histamine and mediator release in the skin cause the itching, redness, and edema that characterize hives. Angioedema represents the same process in deeper tissues. The variability in triggers and chronicity creates a spectrum of presentations, but all share the common feature of mast cell–mediated dermal edema. Effective therapies (like antihistamines, omalizumab, etc.) relieve symptoms by targeting these mediators or their production, underscoring how tightly the phenotype is linked to the molecular mechanisms. Each hive that flares on the skin’s surface is essentially a visible imprint of mast cell activation beneath.  

**Evidence:** The mechanistic insights and associations above are supported by a range of studies: for example, the autoimmune nature of CSU is evidenced by the presence of IgG anti-FcεRI or IgE in roughly 40–50% of patients ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=In%20CSU%2C%20an%20external%20trigger,17%20%2C%20%2024)), the discovery of IgE autoantigens like IL-24 (PMID: 29208545) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=and%20IgE%20anti,44)), and improvements seen with anti-IgE therapy (omalizumab) ([aacijournal.biomedcentral.com](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-024-00931-6#:~:text=%2A%20Second,for%20more%20severe%2C%20chronic%20cases)). Histological analyses of lesional skin show a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils surrounding dilated venules, consistent with the described immune cell recruitment ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775323003962#:~:text=Urticaria%20is%20primarily%20mediated%20by,13.%5E%7B1%7D%20These)). Elevated serum D-dimer and c-Kininogen levels correlate with severe disease and angioedema, implicating coagulation/bradykinin pathways ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31899843/#:~:text=Results%3A%20One%20hundred%20seventeen%20samples,dependent%20on%20the%20presence%20of)). Clinical trials of novel agents targeting MRGPRX2 and Siglec-8 (on mast cells/eosinophils) are underway, reflecting the current understanding of these cells’ central role ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=G,127%7D%20Fujisawa)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12539477/#:~:text=histamine%20release%3B%20this%20effect%20is,CSU.%5E%7B128)). Such findings from recent research (2021–2024) continue to refine our understanding of urticaria pathophysiology and guide mechanism-based treatments.
