## Pathophysiology of Dorsalgia (Back Pain)

**Disease Name:** Dorsalgia (back pain)  
**MONDO ID:** MONDO:0021060 (general back pain) – *Category: Complex Disease*

**Overview:** Dorsalgia refers to pain in the back (dorsal spine region), encompassing a broad spectrum of etiologies including muscular, skeletal, intervertebral disc, and nervous system origins. In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), “Dorsalgia” (code M54) is a general diagnosis for back pain of unspecified cause ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=Kingdom%20,pain%20are%20at%2030%20loci)). It is a **complex disorder** with multifactorial pathophysiology – mechanical wear-and-tear, inflammation, and neurogenic processes all contribute to disease onset and progression. Below, we detail the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying dorsalgia, focusing on how structural spine changes lead to pain, the key biochemical pathways involved, and how these changes translate into clinical symptoms.

### 1. Core Pathophysiology and Mechanisms  
Dorsalgia typically arises from a combination of **mechanical damage** to spinal structures and subsequent **biological responses** (inflammation and neural sensitization). The initiating event is often an acute injury or chronic microtrauma to the spine ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=generates%20the%20pain%20in%20cLBP%2C,facet%20joint%20pain%2C%20sacroiliac%20joint)). Such insults may include: **(a)** **Intervertebral disc degeneration or herniation**, **(b)** **Facet joint osteoarthritis**, or **(c)** **Muscle-ligament strains** – all of which can co-occur ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=either%20produce%20serious%20spinal%20injury%2C,is%20illustrated%20in%20%2023)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=three%20sources%3A%20,A%20summary%20of%20the)). These structural injuries trigger a cascade of degenerative and inflammatory processes that cause pain: 

- **Intervertebral Disc Degeneration:** The intervertebral discs undergo age- and stress-related degeneration characterized by loss of proteoglycans, dehydration, and collagen fiber breakdown in the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=Intervertebral%20disc%20degeneration%20is%20an,root%20ganglion%2C%20or%20smaller%20nerves)). Biomechanical overload (e.g. bending or lifting) can cause annular fissures or **disc herniation**, where disc material protrudes outward ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=misalignment%2C%20can%20lead%20to%20disc,a%20loss%20of%20aggrecan%20and)). A herniated or bulging disc can mechanically compress or irritate adjacent nerve roots or the dorsal root ganglion, activating nociceptive (pain-sensing) fibers and producing back pain and radicular pain down the limb ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=misalignment%2C%20can%20lead%20to%20disc,a%20loss%20of%20aggrecan%20and)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=or%20distension%20of%20the%20nerve,68)). Disc degeneration also leads to structural instability (disc height loss) which alters spine biomechanics and places abnormal stress on facet joints and ligaments ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=stability%20of%20the%20spine%2C%20which,trauma%2C%20causing%20pain%20to%20persist)).

- **Inflammation and Biochemical Cascades:** Degenerating disc tissue secretes pro-inflammatory mediators that drive a **catabolic** cascade in the spine ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)). Cytokines such as **tumor necrosis factor-alpha** (TNF-α) and **interleukin-1 beta** (IL-1β) are elevated in degenerated discs and facet joints, where they activate the **NF-κB signaling pathway** in resident cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)). This leads to increased production of matrix-degrading enzymes – e.g. **matrix metalloproteinases** (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13) and aggrecanases (ADAMTS family) – which **break down collagen and aggrecan** in the disc extracellular matrix, exacerbating structural degeneration ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)). *“Current evidence converges to TNF-α, NF-κB signaling, and ROS-induced pro-inflammation”* as key drivers of painful disc degeneration ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=with%20pain%20outcomes,Major%20weaknesses%20in%20the)). The inflammatory milieu also includes **prostaglandins** (e.g. PGE₂) and **bradykinin**, which sensitize local nerve endings and produce pain. Herniated disc fragments can incite an immune response: infiltration of macrophages, T-cells, and neutrophils into the disc occurs, especially when nucleus pulposus tissue extrudes beyond the annulus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4151534/#:~:text=from%20degenerating%20discs%20promote%20infiltration,mediated%20degenerative%20cascade.%20Taken%20together)). These immune cells release additional cytokines and chemokines, amplifying the inflammatory cascade ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4151534/#:~:text=from%20degenerating%20discs%20promote%20infiltration,mediated%20degenerative%20cascade.%20Taken%20together)). This **localized inflammation** in the spine correlates with pain severity – for example, high TNF-α levels in disc tissue are strongly associated with greater pain intensity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,PERSPECTIVE%3A%20This%20scoping)).

- **Nerve Ingrowth and Sensitization:** Healthy intervertebral discs are mostly **aneural** (lacking nerve supply) except for the outer annulus. With degeneration, disc tissues secrete **neurotrophic factors** that spur pathologic nerve growth. Notably, **nerve growth factor** (NGF) and **brain-derived neurotrophic factor** (BDNF) produced by disc cells and infiltrating immune cells induce the sprouting of new sensory nerve fibers and blood vessels into deeper regions of the degenerated disc ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4151534/#:~:text=cascade,mediated%20degenerative%20cascade.%20Taken%20together)). *“In this inflammatory milieu, neurogenic factors – in particular nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) – generated by disc and immune cells induce expression of pain-associated cation channels in [dorsal root ganglia neurons]. Depolarization of these channels is likely to promote discogenic and radicular pain and reinforce the cytokine-mediated degenerative cascade.”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4151534/#:~:text=microvasculature%20and%20nerve%20fibers%20arising,new%20targets%20for%20treating%20symptomatic)). The ingrowth of nociceptive nerves (and accompanying neovascularization) into inner annulus and nucleus pulposus is a hallmark of **discogenic back pain** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=water%20content%20and%20disc%20height,68)). These newly innervated, inflamed discs can directly generate pain signals. Similarly, degeneration of **facet joints** (spinal osteoarthritis) leads to cartilage loss and osteophyte formation; the facet joint capsule, richly innervated with nociceptors, becomes inflamed and a source of chronic back pain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=caused%20by%20mechanical%20stresses%20induced,reported%20the%20compression%20of%20nerve)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=capsule%20of%20facet%20joints%20is,Since%20then%2C%20nerve%20root)). Facet joint osteophytes can also compress nerve roots (for example, causing foraminal stenosis), contributing to **radiculopathy** (nerve pain, numbness or weakness radiating to limbs) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,82)).

- **Muscle Spasm and Myofascial Pain:** Damage to spinal ligaments or discs often triggers reflexive changes in the **paraspinal muscles**. Instability or misalignment of the spine (due to disc collapse or ligament laxity) is sensed by mechanoreceptors in those structures, leading the central nervous system to increase paraspinal muscle tension in an attempt to stabilize the spine ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,Since%20mechanoreceptors)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=Under%20normal%20circumstances%2C%20the%20mechanoreceptors,48%5D%20and%20accelerate%20disc)). Chronic muscle overactivation can cause **muscle strain, ischemia, and myofascial trigger points**, which themselves become sources of pain (myofascial dorsalgia) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=three%20sources%3A%20,is%20illustrated%20in%20%2023)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=sensitivity%20,greater%20stress%20on%20the%20spine)). Over time, imbalanced and fatigued muscles place greater stress on the spine and can **initiate inflammation of neural tissues** and accelerate degeneration of discs and facets ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=sensitivity%20,greater%20stress%20on%20the%20spine)), creating a vicious cycle. Patients often present with muscle tenderness and spasms in the back, reflecting this component of dorsalgia pathophysiology.

- **Peripheral Sensitization:** The biochemical and structural changes described lead to heightened sensitivity of primary sensory neurons in and around the spine. **Peripheral sensitization** is the process by which persistent inflammation lowers the threshold for nociceptor activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=the%20current%20literature%20suggests%20that,This)). Inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, prostaglandins, etc.) and growth factors (NGF) modulate nociceptive neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), causing increased expression and phosphorylation of ion channels and receptors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=the%20current%20literature%20suggests%20that,This)). For example, continuous exposure to cytokines can upregulate **TRPV1** receptors and **voltage-gated sodium channels** on nociceptor nerve endings, making them fire pain signals in response to normally innocuous stimuli ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=expression%20of%20sodium%20and%20TRPV1,6%2C%20TNF%2C%20chemokines)). Elevated NGF levels also cause DRG neurons to increase production of pain neurotransmitters like **substance P** and **calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=the%20current%20literature%20suggests%20that,This)). As a result, the injured area develops **hyperalgesia** (exaggerated pain from noxious stimuli) and **allodynia** (pain from normally non-painful touch) due to this peripheral sensitization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,other%20parts%20of%20the%20body)). This is often observed in chronic back pain patients who report that gentle pressure or movement can provoke pain.

- **Central Sensitization:** If pain impulses continue unabated, they can induce long-term changes in the central nervous system. Ongoing nociceptive input from the spine leads to hyper-excitability of neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn – a phenomenon known as **central sensitization** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,other%20parts%20of%20the%20body)). Repeated pain signaling via C-fibers triggers increased activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors in dorsal horn neurons, leading to temporal summation of pain (the “wind-up” phenomenon) and expansion of receptive fields ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=expression%20of%20sodium%20and%20TRPV1,6%2C%20TNF%2C%20chemokines)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=excitable%20neurons%20,reactive%20oxygen%20species%20and%20nitric)). Activated dorsal horn neurons release chemokines and excitatory neurotransmitters that stimulate surrounding **glial cells** (microglia and astrocytes) in the spinal cord ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=increase%20in%20pain%20intensity%20over,which%20is%20a%20state%20of)). Once activated, glial cells release a further cocktail of pain mediators into the central nervous system – including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, chemokines, **prostaglandins**, excitatory amino acids (e.g. glutamate), nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species – which potentiate synaptic transmission and neuronal firing ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=transmission%20to%20the%20spinal%20cord,type%20of%20sensitization%20produces%20secondary)). This glia-driven positive feedback *“results in central sensitization, which is a state of reduced thresholds to stimuli associated with activation of spinal cord neurons”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=prostaglandins%2C%20excitatory%20amino%20acids%2C%20reactive,body%20not%20associated%20with%20injury)). Clinically, central sensitization manifests as widespread pain and secondary hyperalgesia beyond the original injury site ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,other%20parts%20of%20the%20body)). The patient’s pain becomes less correlated with peripheral pathology and more a result of pathological signal processing in the spinal cord and brain. Central sensitization is a key mechanism in the chronification of back pain.

Importantly, dorsalgia is now understood not purely as a local spine issue but as a disorder of the **whole nervous system** in chronic cases. Chronic back pain causes measurable neuroplastic changes: brain imaging studies show that prolonged pain is associated with altered activity and even atrophy in pain-processing regions of the brain (e.g. thalamus, prefrontal cortex, amygdala) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,acute%20to%20chronic%20pain%20consistently)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=chronic%20pain%20patients%20have%20been,acute%20to%20chronic%20pain%20consistently)). Over time, emotional and cognitive brain circuits (limbic system, mPFC) become highly engaged, consistent with clinical observations that chronic pain is accompanied by anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing and other psychosocial features ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=demonstrated%20that%20chronic%20pain%20consistently,avoidance)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20even%20though%20different%20types,avoidance)). Thus, the pathophysiology of dorsalgia spans from **molecular** (cytokines, ion channels) and **cellular** (neurons, discs, immune cells) levels to **systems-level** changes in the spinal cord and brain.

### 2. Key Molecular Players and Dysregulated Pathways  
**Genes & Proteins:** Dorsalgia has a significant heritable component, and recent genetic studies have implicated multiple genes in predisposing individuals to spine degeneration and pain. A large 2022 genome-wide association meta-analysis (119,000 cases of dorsalgia) identified **33 genomic loci** linked to chronic back pain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=Back%20pain%20is%20a%20common,function%20%28LoF%29%20variants%20in)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=Kingdom%20,pain%20are%20at%2030%20loci)). Notably, many associated genes relate to **cartilage extracellular matrix and inflammatory signaling**. For example, variants in **CHST3** (carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3) were significantly associated with both intervertebral disc disorders and dorsalgia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=diagnoses%20assigned%20in%20clinical%20practice%3B,Genes)). CHST3 encodes an enzyme that sulfates chondroitin, a crucial modification for proteoglycans in disc cartilage – a 3’UTR variant in CHST3 (rs1871452) was the top hit, suggesting altered proteoglycan biology in disc degeneration ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=diagnoses%20assigned%20in%20clinical%20practice%3B,Genes)). Another gene highlighted is **SLC13A1**, encoding a sodium-sulfate co-transporter: rare loss-of-function mutations in SLC13A1 (frequency ~0.1%) increased risk of disc degeneration (OR ~1.44) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=is%20with%20a%203%E2%80%99UTR%20variant,Genes)). These SLC13A1 variants lead to reduced sulfate levels systemically and likely impair proteoglycan sulfation in discs, weakening the disc matrix ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=is%20with%20a%203%E2%80%99UTR%20variant,as%20neurological%20and%20inflammatory%20processes)). Other genetic loci implicate developmental and structural genes such as **COL11A1** (Collagen XI α1, a minor collagen in cartilage) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=,49.8)) and **SOX5** (a transcription factor regulating chondrogenesis and neuron development) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20genome,15)), as well as inflammation and pain-sensing genes. For instance, an intergenic locus near **GSDMC** (Gasdermin-C) and **CCDC26** was associated with both chronic back pain and severe disc disease ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20genome,15)) – Gasdermins are mediators of inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) and may contribute to disc inflammation. Genes in **TGF-β signaling** and cartilage homeostasis (e.g. **SMAD3**, **FGFR3**) have also been linked to low back pain susceptibility ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=match%20at%20L120%205%20of,a%29%20predicted%20to%20affect)). Additionally, genes related to neuronal function and pain perception are implicated: a notable example is **KCNG2**, encoding a subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels, which might affect the excitability of pain pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=match%20at%20L120%205%20of,a%29%20predicted%20to%20affect)). These genetic findings reinforce that dorsalgia arises from a confluence of **cartilage degeneration pathways**, **inflammatory/immune responses**, and **neuronal sensitization mechanisms** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=conferred%20by%20rare%20%28MAF%E2%80%89%3D%E2%80%890,as%20neurological%20and%20inflammatory%20processes)).

Beyond genetic predisposition, numerous **proteins and signaling pathways** are dysregulated during dorsalgia progression:

- **Pro-inflammatory Cytokines:** TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 are commonly elevated in degenerated discs and facet joints ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4151534/#:~:text=from%20degenerating%20discs%20promote%20infiltration,mediated%20degenerative%20cascade.%20Taken%20together)). These cytokines orchestrate the inflammatory response – TNF-α and IL-1β, in particular, trigger the NF-κB and MAPK pathways inside disc cells, upregulating genes for **matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP3, MMP13)** and **aggrecanases (ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5)** that degrade the disc’s extracellular matrix. They also induce production of **nitric oxide (NO)** and **prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂)**, which contribute to pain and further matrix damage. High levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in disc tissues correlate with the presence of pain – these cytokines can directly stimulate nociceptive nerve fibers and are considered key therapeutic targets in discogenic back pain ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)). In facet joint osteoarthritis, studies have found elevated TNF-α and IL-6 in the synovial tissue of painful arthritic facet joints ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=match%20at%20L941%20,Google)), indicating a similar inflammatory pain mechanism.

- **Matrix Degrading Enzymes:** Enzymes that break down cartilage and connective tissue are upregulated in degenerating spines. These include **collagenases** (MMP-1, MMP-13), **stromelysin** (MMP-3), and **aggrecanases** that together digest the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus matrix. The result is loss of disc height and function. Fragments of degraded matrix can further provoke inflammation. In addition, **catabolic enzymes** in bone (like osteoclast activators) may be involved in Modic changes (inflammatory bone edema seen in some chronic back pain patients), though this is an active area of research. 

- **Neuropeptides and Neurotrophins:** Pain transmission in dorsalgia involves neuropeptides such as **Substance P** and **CGRP** (calcitonin gene-related peptide). These are produced by small diameter nociceptive neurons in the DRG and dorsal horn. In chronic back pain, Substance P and CGRP are found in higher concentrations in affected tissues and CSF, reflecting ongoing nociceptor activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=the%20current%20literature%20suggests%20that,This)). They cause vasodilation and plasma extravasation, contributing to swelling and pain, and also modulate spinal cord neurons to amplify pain signals. **Neurotrophic factors** like NGF and BDNF, as noted earlier, are crucial in developing *“nociceptive sprouting”* — NGF in particular binds to TrkA receptors on pain fibers, causing axonal growth into injured tissue and upregulation of Substance P in those neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4151534/#:~:text=cascade,mediated%20degenerative%20cascade.%20Taken%20together)). Elevated NGF levels in disc tissues are strongly linked to pain generation; conversely, blocking NGF with antibodies (e.g. tanezumab) has shown pain relief in clinical trials of back pain, underscoring NGF’s key role in pathophysiology.

- **Ion Channels and Receptors:** Changes in ion channel expression are central to peripheral sensitization. **TRPV1** (the capsaicin-activated **transient receptor potential vanilloid 1** channel) is typically a heat/pain sensor on nociceptive neurons; inflammation increases TRPV1 density and lowers its activation threshold, so that normal body temperature or mild stimuli can trigger pain signals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=expression%20of%20sodium%20and%20TRPV1,6%2C%20TNF%2C%20chemokines)). **Voltage-gated sodium channels** (especially Na_v1.7, Na_v1.8 encoded by *SCN9A*, *SCN10A*) are also upregulated or hyperactive in chronic pain states, leading to spontaneous ectopic discharges in damaged nerves. Meanwhile, in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, persistent pain causes overactivation of **NMDA receptors** (glutamate receptors) on secondary neurons, which is critical for central sensitization and wind-up ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=expression%20of%20sodium%20and%20TRPV1,6%2C%20TNF%2C%20chemokines)). Inhibitory mechanisms (e.g. GABAergic interneurons) may become impaired at the same time, tilting the balance towards excitation. The end result is a lower pain threshold and amplified signaling.

- **Glial Mediators:** Within the spinal cord, activated **microglia and astrocytes** release their own set of molecular players that maintain pain. These glial-derived factors include pro-inflammatory cytokines (mentioned above), as well as **brain-derived neurotrophic factor** (BDNF, which can modulate neuronal excitability) and **ATP** (which can stimulate microglial P2X receptors in an autocrine loop). They also release **reactive oxygen species (ROS)** and **NO**, which cause oxidative stress in neurons. A 2024 review notes that increased **ROS** in degenerated discs and spinal tissues can directly activate NF-κB and stimulate production of pain-related cytokines and neuropeptides ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)). Thus, oxidative stress is both a result of inflammation and a contributor to persistent pain signaling. Antioxidant mechanisms may be overwhelmed in chronic dorsalgia, and this is an area of interest for potential therapies.

**Chemical Mediators (CHEBI entities):** Numerous small-molecule mediators are involved in dorsalgia’s pathophysiology:

- **Prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂)** – a pro-inflammatory eicosanoid synthesized via COX-2 in inflamed spinal tissues; it lowers the threshold of nociceptors and causes swelling. Elevated PGE₂ is found in herniated disc tissues and facet joint fluid, and NSAID drugs (which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis) often provide analgesic relief ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)).

- **Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)** – chemically reactive molecules like superoxide (O₂⁻) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) generated by stressed disc cells, immune cells, and activated glia. ROS act as signaling molecules that activate inflammatory pathways (e.g. they stabilize HIF-1α and NF-κB) and directly sensitize neurons by oxidizing ion channels. Excess ROS can damage cells in the disc and spinal cord, contributing to degeneration. Antioxidant compounds are being explored to mitigate this aspect ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=with%20pain%20outcomes,Major%20weaknesses%20in%20the)).

- **Glutamate** – the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in pain pathways. High glutamate release in the **synapses of the dorsal horn** leads to excitotoxicity and pain facilitation. Glutamate acts on AMPA/NMDA receptors on postsynaptic neurons; in chronic pain, there is often an upregulation of NMDA receptor activity. Drugs targeting glutamatergic transmission (e.g. NMDA antagonists like ketamine or dextromethorphan) can reduce central sensitization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=expression%20of%20sodium%20and%20TRPV1,Once%20activated%2C%20glial%20cells%20release)).

- **Catecholamines (Adrenaline/Noradrenaline)** – stress hormones can modulate back pain. Chronic pain patients sometimes exhibit dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system. There is evidence of altered **adrenoceptor** expression in painful disc tissues ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,PERSPECTIVE%3A%20This%20scoping)), suggesting that sympathetic nerves (which innervate the spinal periosteum and discs) might influence pain perception. This might explain why stress and anxiety can exacerbate back pain via adrenergic pathways.

- **Nitric Oxide (NO)** – a gaseous signaling molecule produced by nitric oxide synthases in response to inflammation. NO can cause vasodilation (contributing to swelling) and it modulates neurotransmitter release. In the spinal cord, excessive NO from activated glia can enhance neurotransmission of pain and also cause neurotoxic effects on inhibitory interneurons.

- **Others:** **Bradykinin** (an inflammatory peptide that directly activates nociceptors), **Histamine** (from mast cells, contributing to inflammation and pain), and **Serotonin** (from platelets or descending fibers, which can be pro-nociceptive in the spinal cord) are additional chemical mediators in the pain network of dorsalgia.

**Cell Types (CL terms) Involved:** Dorsalgia pathophysiology involves multiple cell types across tissues:

- **Nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells** (disc chondrocyte-like cells): These are the resident cells of the intervertebral disc (analogous to cartilage cells). In degeneration, they have an altered phenotype – shifting from maintaining matrix to producing catabolic enzymes and cytokines (sometimes described as a shift to a “senescent” or inflammatory phenotype). They are the source of many mediators (MMPs, NO, IL-6, etc.) within the disc.

- **Fibroblasts and Osteoblasts** in facet joint capsules and spinal ligaments: These cells contribute to tissue repair and fibrosis. After injury, they secrete inflammatory mediators (e.g. fibroblasts in a damaged ligament produce cytokines and prostaglandins). Osteoblasts in subchondral bone may participate in sclerosis seen in degenerative spine (e.g. Modic changes).

- **Nociceptive sensory neurons** (peripheral neurons in dorsal root ganglia – *CL:0000800*, e.g. small diameter unmyelinated C-fibers and thin myelinated A-delta fibers): These are the primary pain fibers that innervate the spine (outer disc, facet capsule, muscles, etc.). They express receptors like TRPV1, acid-sensing ion channels, and neuropeptides. In dorsalgia, these neurons become hyperexcitable and may undergo axonal sprouting (especially the peptidergic C-fibers that express Substance P). **Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons** are a key site where inflammation can trigger pain – for instance, a herniated disc releasing TNF-α can cause DRG inflammation and sustained firing of that neuron (even without direct compression) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=misalignment%2C%20can%20lead%20to%20disc,a%20loss%20of%20aggrecan%20and)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=or%20distension%20of%20the%20nerve,68)).

- **Spinal cord neurons** in the dorsal horn (nociceptive interneurons and second-order projection neurons): These include excitatory interneurons that relay pain, as well as inhibitory interneurons (GABAergic, glycinergic) that normally modulate pain signals. In chronic pain, the balance shifts – some inhibitory neurons may die or become less effective, while excitatory neurons become potentiated (wind-up). There is evidence from animal models of actual **neurodegeneration of inhibitory interneurons** in the dorsal horn with chronic pain, leading to disinhibition of pain pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=The%20National%20Cancer%20Institute%20defined,of%20chronic%20neuropathic%20pain%20have)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=amyloid%20b,interneurons%20that%20modulate%20nociceptive%20sensory)). These changes in spinal cord cell populations help maintain pain even in the absence of active injury.

- **Glial cells**: Both **microglia** (resident immune cells of the CNS) and **astrocytes** (supportive glia) play a prominent role once pain becomes chronic. Microglia in the dorsal horn become activated by persistent nerve signals (via neuron-released factors like fractalkine or ATP). Activated microglia change morphology, proliferate, and release the pro-inflammatory mediators that enhance pain (IL-1, TNF, BDNF, etc.) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=increase%20in%20pain%20intensity%20over,which%20is%20a%20state%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=transmission%20to%20the%20spinal%20cord,type%20of%20sensitization%20produces%20secondary)). Astrocytes, which normally maintain the chemical environment, also become reactive and can contribute to chronic pain by releasing glutamate and cytokines. These glial responses blur the line between neuropathic pain (nerve damage pain) and inflammatory pain – chronic dorsalgia often has elements of both.

- **Immune cells**: In peripheral sites (disc, facet joint, muscle), **macrophages, T-lymphocytes, B-cells, neutrophils, and mast cells** can infiltrate or get activated. Macrophages, for example, are commonly found in herniated disc tissue that is causing sciatica; they secrete TNF-α, IL-1, and also produce growth factors that encourage nerve ingrowth ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4151534/#:~:text=from%20degenerating%20discs%20promote%20infiltration,mediated%20degenerative%20cascade.%20Taken%20together)). Mast cells can release histamine and NGF, contributing to pain and angiogenesis. In chronic low-level inflammation (like degenerative disc disease without frank herniation), there might not be massive immune cell infiltration, but rather disc-resident cells and perhaps a few macrophages maintain a smoldering inflammation.

- **Muscle cells (Skeletal myocytes) and muscle spindle neurons**: The paraspinal muscles (erector spinae, multifidus) often develop changes in chronic back pain. Muscle fibers can atrophy or undergo fatty replacement if chronically disused (seen in chronic pain patients). Conversely, overuse and spasm of these muscles lead to local ischemia and pain. Muscle spindles (sensory stretch receptors) may become overactive if muscle fibers shorten due to spasm, sending abnormal signals that can contribute to pain perception or reflexes (though this aspect is less understood). **Myofibroblasts** may appear in muscles or fascia as part of a fibrosis process in chronic pain.

**Affected Anatomical Sites (UBERON terms):** By definition, dorsalgia involves the **back region** (UBERON:0001061), particularly the **spine (vertebral column)**. Common anatomical locations and structures implicated include:

- **Lumbar spine (lower back)** – The lumbar vertebrae and discs (e.g., L4-L5, L5-S1) bear the most load and are the most frequent site of degenerative changes leading to low back pain. The **intervertebral discs** (UBERON:0002427) at these levels often show degeneration or herniation in dorsalgia cases. The **lumbar facet joints** (zygapophyseal joints, UBERON:0012591) are synovial joints that can develop osteoarthritis and are a known generator of chronic back pain.

- **Thoracic spine (upper/mid-back)** – Dorsalgia can also refer to mid-back pain (though less common than lumbar). Thoracic vertebrae and associated costovertebral joints can be sources of pain, but serious pathology here is rarer.

- **Sacroiliac joints** (UBERON:0001828) – These joints between the sacrum and ilium (pelvis) can cause pain that mimics low back pain. Sacroiliac dysfunction or inflammation (sacroiliitis) is sometimes considered in chronic back pain, especially in seronegative spondyloarthropathies.

- **Paraspinal musculature and fascia** – The muscles running alongside the spine (multifidus, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, etc., UBERON:0001110 (back muscle)) and their fascia/connective tissue are often involved in dorsalgia. Myofascial trigger points in these muscles are a common source of chronic pain and tenderness on exam.

- **Spinal cord and dorsal horn** (UBERON:0002240 for spinal cord, specifically the dorsal gray matter region) – While not damaged in typical mechanical back pain, the dorsal horn of the spinal cord at corresponding levels becomes a critical site of pathophysiological change (central sensitization). The **dorsal root ganglia** (UBERON:0000044) at lumbar and thoracic levels are also key structures where the cell bodies of nociceptive neurons reside; inflammation or compression of a DRG (for example by a disc herniation) can produce intense neuropathic pain.

- **Vertebrae and Endplates** – Bony structures like the vertebral bodies (UBERON:0001132) and their endplates can develop **microfractures, sclerosis, or edema** (e.g., Modic changes visible on MRI) due to disc degeneration. These bony changes can be painful due to innervation of the periosteum and endplate by nociceptive fibers.

In summary, dorsalgia involves a network of anatomical sites – **intervertebral discs, facet joints, spinal ligaments, paraspinal muscles, nerve roots, and central nervous system structures** – all interacting in the generation of pain.

### 3. Disrupted Biological Processes (GO Terms)  
At the level of biological processes, dorsalgia’s pathogenesis perturbs multiple normal physiological processes. Key **Gene Ontology (GO)** categories affected include:

- **Extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198)** – The balance between matrix synthesis and degradation in intervertebral discs is disrupted. Normally, disc cells maintain a collagen- and proteoglycan-rich matrix that provides structural support. In degeneration, **extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617)** is accelerated by enzymes like MMPs and aggrecanases, leading to loss of disc integrity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=Intervertebral%20disc%20degeneration%20is%20an,root%20ganglion%2C%20or%20smaller%20nerves)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,68)).

- **Inflammatory response (GO:0006954)** – An innate inflammatory reaction is a core part of dorsalgia. The detection of tissue damage initiates signaling cascades (NF-κB, MAPK) that result in cytokine production, leukocyte recruitment, and chronic inflammation in spinal structures ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)). This includes processes like **cytokine-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0019221)** and **immune cell chemotaxis (GO:0060326)** into affected tissues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4151534/#:~:text=from%20degenerating%20discs%20promote%20infiltration,mediated%20degenerative%20cascade.%20Taken%20together)).

- **Cellular response to stress (GO:0033554)** – Disc and neuronal cells undergo stress responses due to biomechanical strain and oxidative stress. For example, disc cells respond to high mechanical load by activating stress pathways (e.g. increased ROS production, unfolded protein response), and neurons activate stress kinases in response to inflammation.

- **Apoptotic process (GO:0006915)** – Programmed cell death is seen in various contexts: intervertebral disc cells undergo apoptosis during degeneration (contributing to loss of cellularity in the disc). In chronic pain, there is evidence of apoptosis of inhibitory interneurons in the spinal dorsal horn, as mentioned, which is unusual in normal physiology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=The%20National%20Cancer%20Institute%20defined,of%20chronic%20neuropathic%20pain%20have)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=amyloid%20b,interneurons%20that%20modulate%20nociceptive%20sensory)). This loss of neurons is a neurodegenerative aspect of chronic pain.

- **Angiogenesis (GO:0001525)** – Normally, adult intervertebral discs are avascular. In degenerated discs, **blood vessel growth** occurs concurrently with nerve ingrowth ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=water%20content%20and%20disc%20height,68)). The process of new blood vessel formation into the disc is an example of aberrant angiogenesis, guided by factors like VEGF, and is associated with inflammation and degeneration.

- **Axon guidance/nerve growth (GO:0007411)** – Nerve sprouting into tissues involves axon guidance processes. NGF and other neurotrophins alter the normal guidance cues, causing sensory axons to penetrate regions they typically wouldn’t (inner disc, hypertrophic ligament, etc.). This represents a pathological activation of developmental axon growth programs in the adult, contributing to pain.

- **Sensory perception of pain (nociception) (GO:0019233)** – Dorsalgia by definition involves the biological process of pain sensation. This GO term encompasses the transduction of a noxious stimulus by peripheral sensory neurons, transmission of that signal through the nervous system, and its perception in the brain. In dorsalgia, this process is exaggerated and altered by sensitization. Related processes like **signal transmission (GO:0023060)** and **synaptic plasticity (GO:0048167)** in pain pathways are also disrupted: the dorsal horn synapses exhibit long-term potentiation-like changes (central sensitization is essentially maladaptive synaptic plasticity in pain circuits) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=expression%20of%20sodium%20and%20TRPV1,reactive%20oxygen%20species%20and%20nitric)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=prostaglandins%2C%20excitatory%20amino%20acids%2C%20reactive,body%20not%20associated%20with%20injury)).

- **Regulation of ion transport (GO:0043269)** – Because many ion channels are upregulated or modified (phosphorylated) in chronic pain, the normal regulation of ion flow (Na^+, Ca^2+, etc.) across neuronal membranes is affected. This is part of the mechanism of hyperexcitability.

- **Locomotion (GO:0040011) and muscle contraction (GO:0006936)** – While these are higher-level processes, chronic back pain can lead to changes in gait and muscle function. Reflexive muscle guarding and changes in posture reflect altered neuromuscular processes. Patients with chronic dorsalgia often have impaired postural control and muscle activation patterns, indicating that even motor processes are impacted secondary to pain.

From a GO annotation perspective, dorsalgia would be linked to terms involving **catabolic processes, inflammatory signaling, neuron activation, and neuroplastic changes**. These disrupted processes underscore that dorsalgia is not a single pathway disease but rather a convergence of **orthopedic injury processes (degeneration, inflammation)** and **neurosensory processes (pain transmission and plasticity)**.

### 4. Key Cellular Components (Subcellular Localization)  
Pathologically, the molecular events in dorsalgia occur in specific cellular compartments and anatomical microenvironments:

- **Extracellular matrix (ECM)** of the disc and joint cartilage: This is the locus of degenerative changes. The disc ECM (rich in type II collagen and aggrecan) is degraded by enzymes working in the extracellular space ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=Intervertebral%20disc%20degeneration%20is%20an,root%20ganglion%2C%20or%20smaller%20nerves)). Matrix fragments (e.g. fibronectin fragments) present in the ECM can bind to cell surface receptors (integrins, TLRs) and perpetuate inflammation. The **annulus fibrosus outer ECM** is where nerve fibers typically terminate; with degeneration, these fibers penetrate deeper into the **nucleus pulposus ECM** which has lost its immune privilege ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=water%20content%20and%20disc%20height,68)).

- **Cell membrane (plasma membrane)** of nociceptors and disc cells: Critical receptors and channels reside here. On nociceptive neurons, the plasma membrane houses **TRPV1 channels, sodium channels (Na_v1.7/1.8), calcium channels, P2X purinergic receptors, bradykinin and prostaglandin receptors**, etc., all of which are involved in initiating pain signals. Increased insertion of these channels into the membrane (or altered gating properties) is a key change in sensitization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=expression%20of%20sodium%20and%20TRPV1,6%2C%20TNF%2C%20chemokines)). On disc cells and facet chondrocytes, the plasma membrane carries receptors for inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF receptor, IL-1 receptor) and mechanoreceptors; these initiate intracellular cascades when activated by stress or cytokines.

- **Cytoplasm and Cytosol:** Many signaling events occur in the cytosol. In disc cells, binding of TNF-α or IL-1β to their receptors triggers cytosolic kinase cascades (IKK, MAPKs) that converge on transcription factors. For example, **NF-κB** is normally held inactive in the cytoplasm by IκB; cytokine signaling causes IκB degradation and NF-κB translocation to the nucleus ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)). Similarly, in neurons, persistent activation of receptors leads to cytosolic accumulation of protein kinases (PKA, PKC) that phosphorylate ion channels and receptors, tuning their sensitivity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=the%20current%20literature%20suggests%20that,This)). The cytosol is also where elevated ROS can cause oxidative damage or activate redox-sensitive signaling proteins.

- **Cell nucleus:** Changes in gene expression occur here. Inflammatory signaling leads to activation of transcription factors like **NF-κB, AP-1, and STATs**, which move into the nucleus of disc cells, macrophages, or glial cells and induce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. genes encoding cytokines, MMPs, COX-2, etc.). In neurons, activity-dependent transcription factors such as **CREB** (cAMP response element-binding protein) in the nucleus might turn on genes that perpetuate pain (e.g. dynorphin, a pronociceptive peptide, is upregulated in dorsal horn neuron nuclei during chronic pain). Long-term changes in the dorsal horn likely involve changes in gene transcription in spinal neurons and glia.

- **Synapses (synaptic cleft and pre/postsynaptic terminals):** In the spinal dorsal horn, the synaptic connections between primary afferent fibers and second-order neurons are a critical site of modulation. With central sensitization, increased release of **glutamate** and **Substance P** from presynaptic terminals into the synaptic cleft occurs, along with reduced uptake of glutamate by glial cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=transmission%20to%20the%20spinal%20cord,type%20of%20sensitization%20produces%20secondary)). Postsynaptic densities might accumulate more NMDA receptors. The result is a potentiated synapse. Thus, the **dorsal horn gray matter synaptic networks** are an anatomical locus of pain amplification in chronic dorsalgia.

- **Mitochondria:** These organelles are the powerhouses of the cell but also sources of ROS. In degenerated disc cells, mitochondrial dysfunction (due to aging or hypoxia) can lead to excess ROS generation, which in turn drives inflammation. In neurons, high-frequency firing and ion imbalance can cause mitochondrial stress. Mitochondrial damage in muscle cells due to chronic tension may also reduce muscle endurance, contributing to chronic pain and fatigue. While not often highlighted, the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress is a component of the cellular pathophysiology (as suggested by the identified significance of ROS in pain signaling ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=with%20pain%20outcomes,Major%20weaknesses%20in%20the))).

- **Matrix vesicles and nerve myelin sheaths:** In calcifying tissues (like when endplates calcify), matrix vesicles might contribute to pathological calcification. In nerves, if there is chronic compression (e.g. severe stenosis), demyelination of nerve fibers can occur which exposes more axon membrane and can lead to ectopic firing. Demyelinated fibers (loss of the myelin component) are known to produce neuropathic pain symptoms.

Overall, **pathological processes in dorsalgia span multiple cellular compartments**: from the extracellular matrix where tissue breakdown and immune cell–matrix interactions occur, to the cell membrane where signals are received and transmitted, through the cytoplasm and nucleus where gene expression is altered, and finally to the synapses in the central nervous system where pain perception is modulated.

### 5. Sequence of Disease Progression  
Dorsalgia can progress from an acute injury to a chronic pain syndrome through several stages. The **sequence of events** is often as follows:

- **Initiation (Acute Phase):** An inciting event – such as lifting a heavy object with poor mechanics, a sudden fall/twist, or cumulative minor trauma – causes **acute damage** to spinal tissues (e.g. annular tear in a disc, muscle tear, or facet joint strain) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=generates%20the%20pain%20in%20cLBP%2C,facet%20joint%20pain%2C%20sacroiliac%20joint)). Tissue injury triggers an immediate inflammatory response: damaged cells release **DAMPS** (damage-associated molecular patterns) that activate local immune cells and provoke cytokine release. The patient experiences acute back pain at the site of injury, which is nociceptive pain tightly coupled to tissue damage (adaptive in that it warns the person to limit movement). If the injury is mild, healing and remodeling of the tissue can occur over days to weeks, and pain resolves (**resolution phase**).

- **Subacute Degenerative Changes:** In some cases, the initial injury does not fully heal, especially if biomechanical stress on the spine continues. Small annulus tears, for example, may not completely repair, and instead the disc’s microarchitecture begins to deteriorate. Over weeks to months, a **degenerative cascade** sets in: the intervertebral disc’s matrix breaks down (proteoglycan loss leads to reduced disc height), and abnormal motion or loading transfers stress to facet joints and ligaments ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=stability%20of%20the%20spine%2C%20which,trauma%2C%20causing%20pain%20to%20persist)). The body may respond with **fibrosis** (stiffening of ligaments) and osteophyte formation around facets and vertebrae (an attempt to stabilize). During this phase, the patient might have intermittent back pain flare-ups, especially with activity, corresponding to episodes of inflammation or small injuries (e.g. minor disc herniations that resolve). Imaging at this stage might show early degenerative changes such as reduced disc signal on MRI or small osteophytes.

- **Chronic Established Dorsalgia:** When degenerative changes reach a threshold and/or pain-sensitization mechanisms take hold, the pain becomes chronic (persisting >3–6 months and often for years). In this **chronic phase**, the pain is less episodic and more continuous or recurrent. There may be distinct **stages**:
  - **Peripheral Sensitization Stage:** Ongoing degeneration and inflammation in the spine keep peripheral nerves in a sensitized state. The patient might report that previously tolerable activities now provoke pain, indicating a lowered threshold (e.g. sitting for short periods causes pain due to sensitized disc nerves). In this stage, pain is still primarily peripheral; treating the source (e.g. anti-inflammatory injections into a facet joint or removing a herniated disc fragment) can often provide relief.
  - **Transition to Central Sensitization:** With persistent input, changes in the spinal cord begin to sustain the pain independently. This transition can be insidious; the pain spreads or becomes less well-defined (for example, low back pain may radiate more diffusely, or the patient also develops pain in areas that did not have an injury). There is evidence that *“for pain to go from acute to chronic, the morphology and function of the central nervous system itself changes into a pathological state”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=the%20absence%20of%20any%20tangible,76%20%2C%2086%2C78%5D.%20This)). The patient might develop **secondary hyperalgesia** (surrounding areas become tender) and **allodynia**. Sleep disturbances, fatigue, and mood changes often appear, marking that the pain syndrome is affecting the central nervous system and overall health.
  - **Chronic Pain Syndrome Stage:** Ultimately, the person may have a self-perpetuating pain syndrome. At this stage, structural findings (like a disc protrusion on MRI) may no longer correlate well with pain severity – the pain is being driven by the sensitized nervous system (a mix of neuropathic and centralized pain). The patient may have chronic muscle tension, deconditioning of spinal muscles (due to disuse from fear of pain), and psychological components (anxiety, depression) that feed into the pain experience (the “biopsychosocial” model of chronic back pain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=Chronic%20low%20back%20pain%20,Therefore%2C%20to%20begin%20exploring%20what))). Stages of chronic dorsalgia can include cycles of exacerbation and remission, often influenced by stress or physical activity levels. 

It’s worth noting that **not all patients follow the same progression**. Some have primarily mechanical pain that, while chronic, remains linked to movement and structural issues (often termed “chronic but not sensitized”). Others develop a strong central component. Identifying these stages is important for treatment: early intervention in the degenerative cascade (e.g. improving biomechanics, physical therapy to strengthen core muscles, anti-inflammatory treatments) might prevent chronification. Once central sensitization is established, treatment must also target the nervous system (using medications like SNRIs, anticonvulsants, or non-pharmacological approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy and exercise that help retrain the nervous system).

In summary, dorsalgia often begins with a **triggering injury**, evolves through a phase of **degeneration and inflammation**, and in chronic cases leads to a state of **neuroplastic pain memory** that sustains the pain independent of ongoing tissue damage ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=the%20absence%20of%20any%20tangible,76%20%2C%2086%2C78%5D.%20This)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=prostaglandins%2C%20excitatory%20amino%20acids%2C%20reactive,body%20not%20associated%20with%20injury)). This progression from acute nociceptive pain to chronic centralized pain underlies the challenges in treating long-standing back pain.

### 6. Clinical Phenotypes and Manifestations  
The clinical manifestations of dorsalgia reflect the underlying pathophysiological processes and can be correlated with specific mechanisms:

- **Back Pain (Axial pain)** – The primary phenotype is pain localized to the back (thoracic or lumbar region). Patients describe **low back pain** (if lumbosacral) or **mid-back pain** (if thoracic) that can be dull, aching, or sharp. This axial pain corresponds to sources like degenerated discs or facet joints, which refer pain locally. For example, an inflamed facet joint at L4-L5 causes pain just off midline at that level. Discogenic pain can be more midline and may worsen with sitting or forward bending (as intradiscal pressure rises) – this aligns with annulus tears that get stressed with flexion. Axial pain from muscle strain is often aching and associated with muscle tightness on exam. The presence of chronic inflammation (e.g. TNF-α in a disc) has been correlated with the severity of such pain ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,PERSPECTIVE%3A%20This%20scoping)).

- **Radicular Pain (Sciatica) and Neurological Symptoms** – If spinal nerve roots are compressed or irritated (by a herniated disc, osteophyte stenosis, or inflammatory chemicals), patients experience **radicular pain** radiating along the nerve distribution (e.g. sciatic pain down the leg, or a thoracic radiculopathy around the chest). Radicular pain is often sharp, shooting, or electric shock-like, reflecting nerve fiber involvement. It may be accompanied by **numbness, tingling (paresthesias)**, or even **motor weakness** in the muscles served by the affected nerve (for instance, an L5 radiculopathy can cause foot drop). These neurological signs correspond to the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation – e.g., a lumbar disc herniation compressing the L5 nerve root causes dysfunction of sensory and motor axons (HP:0003418 **Radiating leg pain**, HP:0003690 **Paresthesia**). Inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α released near a nerve root can induce demyelination or hyperexcitability of that nerve, causing radicular pain even without severe compression ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4151534/#:~:text=from%20degenerating%20discs%20promote%20infiltration,mediated%20degenerative%20cascade.%20Taken%20together)).

- **Muscle Spasm and Stiffness** – Many patients with dorsalgia exhibit **paraspinal muscle spasm**, felt as tight ropy bands in the back muscles and a reduced range of motion in the spine (HP:0003808 **Limitation of spine movement**). This ties back to the mechanoreceptor-driven reflex loops: injury to ligaments/discs triggers increased muscle tone to stabilize the spine ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,Since%20mechanoreceptors)). On exam, there may be flattening of the normal lumbar lordosis due to muscle spasm or an inability to bend forward/backward fully. The stiffness is usually worse after rest (morning or after sitting) due to chronic inflammation and muscle guarding. As inflammation subsides with rest or moderate activity, flexibility can improve.

- **Tenderness and Trigger Points** – Palpation often reveals tenderness over specific structures: e.g., facet joint line tenderness, sacroiliac joint tenderness, or tight bands in muscles that reproduce the pain upon pressing (myofascial trigger points). These findings connect to local pathophysiology: a tender spot over a facet joint suggests facet synovitis; a trigger point in muscle suggests localized ischemia and inflammatory mediators (like Substance P) sensitizing muscle nociceptors.

- **Hyperalgesia and Allodynia** – In chronic dorsalgia, one may find that the patient has an exaggerated pain response to stimuli. For example, light touch or a mild poke in the lower back or leg may produce pain (mechanical allodynia), and pinprick or pressure causes more pain than expected (hyperalgesia). These clinical signs are indicative of **sensitization**. Secondary hyperalgesia (pain spreading beyond the original injury area) is a clue that central sensitization has set in ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,other%20parts%20of%20the%20body)). This might be tested with a pinprick exam showing an expanded area of tenderness. It correlates with the dorsal horn changes – an objective manifestation of the increased excitability of central neurons.

- **Chronic Pain Behavior and Associated Symptoms:** Patients with long-standing dorsalgia may develop certain behaviors and co-morbid symptoms that are phenotypic manifestations of chronic pain’s effect on the central nervous system. **Pain catastrophizing** (expressing that the pain is overwhelming or will never improve), **fear-avoidance behavior** (avoiding movement or activity for fear of pain/injury), poor sleep, irritability, and depression can occur. These relate to the involvement of the limbic system and prefrontal cortex in chronic pain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=time,confirmed%20that%20the%20resting%20state)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=demonstrated%20that%20chronic%20pain%20consistently,avoidance)). Cognitive effects like difficulty concentrating or memory issues can also be reported, possibly due to pain-related distraction or the subtle neurodegenerative changes observed in chronic pain (e.g. some studies show reduced gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex in chronic back pain patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,acute%20to%20chronic%20pain%20consistently))). While these are not direct “spine” symptoms, they are part of the phenotype of chronic dorsalgia and underscore its complexity.

- **Physical Examination Correlation:** Depending on the predominant pathophysiology, exam findings can differ. For instance:
  - Discogenic pain: often a positive **straight leg raise test** (if nerve root irritation), pain worse on sitting/flexion (increases disc pressure), and relief when lying down. Provocative discography (pressurizing a disc with injection) reproduces pain in discogenic cases.
  - Facet joint pain: typically worse on extension or twisting of the spine (loads the facet), pain is more localized, and there is often tenderness on pressing the facet region. Facet pain can be temporarily relieved by anesthetic injections into the facet joint, confirming it as source.
  - Myofascial pain: localized firm muscle knots and pain reproduced by pressure on those knots; range of motion might be fairly preserved except at the extremes where muscle tension kicks in.
  - Central sensitization-dominant pain: less clear mechanical pattern, more diffuse tenderness (sometimes positive trigger point exams at many sites), and possibly signs of other centralized pain (headaches, pain in unrelated areas).

Understanding these phenotypic patterns helps clinicians relate them to the underlying mechanisms – for example, a patient with predominantly mechanical features and no signs of sensitization might benefit most from addressing structural issues (exercise, physiotherapy, maybe surgery if severe structural compression), whereas a patient with widespread pain and allodynia will need treatments targeting the nervous system (neuromodulating medications, pain rehabilitation).

### 7. Notable Evidence and References  
- **Genetic and Molecular Evidence:** A 2022 *Nature Communications* study (Palsson et al., published Feb 2022) conducted the largest GWAS of back pain to date, analyzing >119,000 cases of dorsalgia and ~909,000 controls ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=Back%20pain%20is%20a%20common,function%20%28LoF%29%20variants%20in)). It identified 30 novel genetic loci, reinforcing that pathways in **cartilage maintenance, inflammation, and neural signaling** underlie susceptibility to dorsalgia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=conferred%20by%20rare%20%28MAF%E2%80%89%3D%E2%80%890,as%20neurological%20and%20inflammatory%20processes)). (PMID: 35110524). Another study highlighted the role of **collagen IX** variants in disc degeneration – a known association was a Trp2 allele in **COL9A2** that predisposes to lumbar disc disease (Annunen et al., *JAMA* 1999), linking a structural matrix protein defect to early disc degeneration.

- **Cytokine and Disc Biology:** A narrative review by de Geer (2018) summarized that degenerating intervertebral discs show an imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, with **IL-1β and TNF-α acting as key “catabolic switch” molecules** that drive further matrix breakdown and nerve sensitization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,Google)). In animal models, injecting these cytokines into healthy discs can induce pain behavior and disc changes, whereas blocking them (e.g. with etanercept, a TNF inhibitor) can alleviate discogenic pain, supporting their causal role.

- **Pain Mechanisms:** A 2024 scoping review by Lim et al. in *PAIN* (the journal) specifically looked at human discogenic low back pain and confirmed that **TNF-α, activation of NF-κB, and oxidative stress** are consistently associated with painful discs ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374801/#:~:text=molecular%20mechanisms%20associated%20with%20DLBP,inflammation%20as)) (PMID: 37227206, published Jan 2024). Interestingly, it noted the need for better correlation of molecular findings with actual pain phenotypes, as many studies examine degeneration without measuring pain.

- **Neuroplastic Changes:** Mosabbir et al. (Life (Basel), 2023) reviewed the links between chronic low back pain and neurodegenerative changes, noting MRI studies where chronic back pain patients had reduced gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex and thalamus, changes similar to those seen in aging and neurodegeneration ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=,acute%20to%20chronic%20pain%20consistently)). They propose that chronic pain’s continuous activation of stress pathways (glucocorticoids, glutamate excitotoxicity, etc.) may contribute to a slow neurotoxic effect on the brain, potentially explaining cognitive complaints in these patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9862392/#:~:text=demonstrated%20that%20chronic%20pain%20consistently,avoidance)).

- **Expert Consensus:** The Lancet published a landmark series on low back pain in 2018 (Hartvigsen et al., 2018) emphasizing that most low back pain is multi-factorial and that **non-specific back pain** often lacks a single identifiable pathoanatomic cause. They highlighted that findings like disc degeneration or “wear and tear” on imaging are frequently present in pain-free individuals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810832/#:~:text=intervertebral%20disc%20disorders%20,10%20%2C%2012)). This underlines that it’s the **active pathophysiological processes** – inflammation, nerve irritation, etc. – that differentiate painful conditions from benign aging changes. It’s a call for careful interpretation of imaging and focusing on patient-centered management addressing all contributors (biological, psychological, social).

In conclusion, **dorsalgia (back pain) pathophysiology is a complex interplay of structural degeneration, inflammatory biochemistry, and neural plasticity**. It starts with localized tissue changes in the spine (discs, joints, muscles) and, in chronic cases, evolves to involve widespread changes in the nervous system’s processing of pain. Understanding these mechanisms – from genes and molecules (e.g. cytokines, MMPs, NGF) to cells (disc cells, neurons, glia) and tissues (spine structures, spinal cord, brain) – is crucial for developing effective treatments. Current research is actively exploring targeted therapies, such as cytokine inhibitors, neurotrophin blockers, regenerative strategies (e.g. stem cell therapy to rebuild disc matrix), and neuromodulation techniques, to interrupt the pathological processes and provide relief for patients suffering from chronic dorsalgia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303450/#:~:text=inflammation%20and%20extra%E2%80%90cellular%20matrix%20breakdown%2C,and%20innervation%20and%20excitability%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11303450/#:~:text=the%20sensory%20neurons%20often%20remains,are%20based%20on%20acute%20IVD)). As our knowledge of these pathways grows, it holds promise for more mechanism-based interventions to treat and perhaps even prevent chronic back pain.
