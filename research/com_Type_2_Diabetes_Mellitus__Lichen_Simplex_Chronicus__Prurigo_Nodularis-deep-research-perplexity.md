# Comorbidity Between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Pruritic Skin Conditions: A Comprehensive Analysis of Lichen Simplex Chronicus and Prurigo Nodularis

The relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic pruritic skin conditions has emerged as an increasingly recognized comorbidity pattern with significant clinical and public health implications. Recent epidemiological studies demonstrate that both lichen simplex chronicus (LSC) and prurigo nodularis (PN) occur with substantially elevated prevalence in diabetic populations compared to the general population, while mechanistic investigations reveal shared pathways involving neuroimmune dysregulation, metabolic inflammation, and altered epidermal barrier function. This comprehensive report synthesizes current evidence regarding the statistical associations, mechanistic hypotheses, and clinical significance of comorbidity between T2DM and these chronic pruritic dermatological conditions, providing a detailed analysis of how metabolic dysfunction and dermatological disease intersect through multiple biological systems.

## Statistical Evidence for Association Between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Pruritic Skin Conditions

### Lichen Simplex Chronicus and Type 2 Diabetes Association

Lichen simplex chronicus represents a chronic neurodermatitic condition characterized by localized areas of thickened, lichenified skin resulting from the persistent itch-scratch cycle. A recent retrospective analysis examining 125 patients with clinically confirmed LSC found that type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 30 percent of this patient population, compared with an approximate prevalence of 11 percent in the general United States adult population[4][40]. This finding demonstrates a nearly threefold increase in the prevalence of T2DM among LSC patients. Beyond diabetes alone, this same cohort demonstrated a substantially elevated burden of metabolic comorbidities, with hypertension present in 61 percent of LSC patients compared with approximately 45 percent in the general population, and hyperlipidemia documented in 26 percent of the LSC cohort[4][28][40]. The study stratified patients by disease extent, revealing that individuals with multiple-lesion LSC experienced significantly higher itch severity with a mean Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score of 7.81 compared to 7.08 for those with localized disease (p = 0.001), and these multiply-affected patients were more likely to be female (81 percent versus 46 percent, p = 0.002)[4][40].

### Prurigo Nodularis and Type 2 Diabetes Association

The epidemiological association between prurigo nodularis and type 2 diabetes mellitus appears even more pronounced than the LSC-T2DM relationship. A substantial United Kingdom retrospective database analysis utilizing the Clinical Practice Research Datalink examined incident cases of PN from 2008 through 2018, identifying 2,416 patients with PN who were matched to 2,409 control patients[2][26][41]. Within this cohort, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was significantly higher for PN patients, with a relative risk of 1.836 (95 percent confidence interval = 1.597-2.111) compared with matched controls[2][26][41]. This finding indicates approximately an 83 percent increased risk for T2DM in patients with PN relative to the general population represented by the control group. The same study documented that total primary and secondary healthcare costs were £2,531 for PN patients versus £1,333 for controls, representing a cost ratio of 1.62 (95% CI = 1.36-1.94), with notably elevated outpatient costs at a ratio of 2.34 (95% CI = 2.13-2.58)[2][26][41].

A systematic review and meta-analysis examining comorbidities associated with chronic prurigo (of which PN is a subtype) synthesized data from 17 studies and calculated pooled odds ratios for various comorbid conditions[5][43][46]. For T2DM specifically, the analysis yielded a pooled odds ratio of 1.89 (95% CI = 1.34-2.68), confirming a statistically significant association between chronic prurigo and type 2 diabetes[5][43][46]. When examining all diabetes types combined (pooled OR = 4.93; 95% CI = 1.13-21.56), the association was even more pronounced, though the wider confidence interval reflects greater heterogeneity across studies in how diabetes was categorized and measured[5][43][46]. Recent systematic literature review findings indicate that approximately one-third of patients with prurigo nodularis also suffer from T2DM, underscoring the substantial overlap between these conditions[8]. The same review noted that PN patients commonly present with systemic metabolic dysfunction beyond diabetes alone, including higher occurrences of metabolic syndrome and its components including obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension compared with the general population[8].

### Temporal and Bidirectional Relationships

A critical epidemiological consideration involves the temporal relationship between T2DM and these chronic pruritic conditions. In the UK retrospective analysis of PN, researchers specifically examined not only prevalent comorbidities at baseline but also the subsequent risk of developing new-onset conditions after PN diagnosis[2][26][41]. While the study found that subsequent risk of atopic dermatitis, depression, and coronary heart disease were significantly increased in PN patients (with hazard ratios of 6.58, 1.61, and 1.37 respectively), the analysis did not specifically report whether T2DM incidence increased following PN diagnosis[2][26][41]. However, the substantial prevalence of T2DM at baseline (83 percent increased risk) suggests that metabolic dysfunction may either precede or coexist with PN development in many patients, rather than PN directly causing subsequent diabetes.

A bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis investigating causal relationships between diabetes, body mass index, and lichen sclerosus (a related lichenoid condition) found that diabetes was not statistically significantly causally associated with lichen sclerosus, and lichen sclerosus was not a predisposing factor for diabetes[25]. The authors hypothesized that previously observed associations in observational studies may reflect confounding by shared risk factors such as age, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction rather than direct causal relationships. Specifically, they noted that the high-risk population comprises menopausal women and middle-aged men, which coincides with the typical onset age of both T2DM and lichenoid skin conditions, potentially leading to a spurious association of the two diseases[25]. This finding emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between association and causation, and highlights the role of confounding factors in the observed comorbidity patterns.

### Oral Manifestations and Glucose Tolerance Abnormalities

The association between diabetes-related conditions and lichen planus extends to oral presentations of lichenoid disease. A cross-sectional study involving 525 patients with diabetes mellitus and 525 matched controls assessed the prevalence of oral lichen planus in diabetic populations[16]. Oral lichen planus was significantly more prevalent in the diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus groups compared with controls (2.3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively versus 0.6 percent in controls, p = 0.019 and p = 0.022)[16]. These findings are consistent with earlier systematic literature indicating that approximately one in four patients with lichen planus have diabetes mellitus, though the relationship has been contested in some studies[1][45].

A meta-analysis examining the prevalence of oral lichen planus in diabetes mellitus synthesized data from 11 case-control studies involving 4,937 diabetic patients and 3,698 control subjects[42]. The overall prevalence of oral lichen planus in diabetic patients was 1.5 percent compared with 0.75 percent in control subjects, yielding a significantly elevated risk in diabetic populations[42]. The meta-analysis noted that different studies reported varying prevalence rates (ranging from 0.5 percent to 9.3 percent in DM patients and 0 percent to 1.8 percent in controls), which the authors attributed to variations in patient selection criteria, age and sex distributions, diabetes type, medication use, and diagnostic criteria applied across studies[42]. The analysis further noted that some studies suggested no significant association between oral lichen planus and diabetes, but the meta-analysis overall demonstrated statistical significance, suggesting that medication effects (particularly older oral hypoglycemic agents) and immune system compromise in diabetes represent plausible explanatory mechanisms[42].

## Mechanistic Pathways Linking Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Pruritic Skin Conditions

### Advanced Glycation End Products and Skin Pathology

Among the most extensively characterized mechanistic pathways linking T2DM to skin complications are those mediated by advanced glycation end products (AGEs). During prolonged hyperglycemic states characteristic of diabetes mellitus, glucose forms non-enzymatic covalent adducts with plasma proteins through a process known as glycation, ultimately generating AGEs[22][27]. Protein glycation and AGE formation play fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of various diabetic complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy[22]. Recent investigations have expanded this mechanistic understanding to include cutaneous manifestations, revealing that AGEs interact with plasma membrane-localized receptors for AGEs (RAGE) to alter intracellular signaling, gene expression, release of pro-inflammatory molecules, and generation of free radicals[22].

At the epidermal level, AGEs accumulation produces multifaceted alterations in skin structure and function. The formation of advanced glycation end products in the skin occurs through hyperglycemia-induced processes, with metabolic byproducts such as methylglyoxal (MGO) acting as particularly potent mediators[19][22]. Within the epidermis, AGEs have been demonstrated to alter the expression and distribution of critical structural proteins, including decreased expression of filaggrin, loricrin, and involucrin through effects on keratinocyte differentiation[19][50]. A comprehensive molecular analysis examining AGE-induced skin damage revealed that three-dimensional skin models treated with glycation showed overexpression of α1 integrin and β6 integrin in the epidermal basal layer, resulting in disrupted keratinocyte stratification, vacuolated cytoplasm, and thinning of the stratum corneum[19]. These alterations compromise the epidermal barrier function, which carries downstream consequences for immune homeostasis and itch sensation.

The dermal compartment experiences profound AGE-mediated damage through mechanisms affecting fibroblast survival and extracellular matrix integrity. Carboxymethyl lysine (CML), identified as the most abundant AGE in the human body, activates reactive oxygen species and induces expression of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), ultimately activating the FOXO1 transcription factor and leading to fibroblast apoptosis[19]. Additionally, AGEs accumulate in the dermal extracellular matrix, altering the balance between synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components and ultimately impairing skin homeostasis[19]. Studies demonstrate that glycation stimulation increases activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9) while simultaneously decreasing extracellular matrix synthesis, leading to net degradation of the dermal scaffold[19]. The recombinant skin models studied by various investigators confirmed that under glycation conditions, matrix-degrading enzymes show increased activity while collagen and elastin synthesis decrease, ultimately resulting in degradation of the extracellular matrix[19].

### Neuroinflammatory Pathways and Cytokine-Mediated Itch

The chronic itch characteristic of both LSC and PN, and exacerbated by concurrent T2DM, involves complex neuroimmune interactions mediated by specific cytokines and neuropeptides. Interleukin-31 (IL-31) has emerged as a critical mediator of pruritus in both atopic and non-atopic chronic pruritic conditions[18][20][23]. IL-31 is produced primarily by T helper 2 (Th2) cells and functions through a heterodimeric receptor consisting of IL-31 receptor alpha (IL-31RA) and oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRβ)[18]. This receptor complex is expressed on human and murine dorsal root ganglia neurons, epithelial cells including keratinocytes, and various innate immune cells, positioning IL-31 as a critical mediator in neuroimmune communication[18]. In prurigo nodularis skin biopsies specifically, IL-31 messenger RNA demonstrates a remarkable 50-fold upregulation compared with healthy skin biopsies[33][56]. Studies in mouse models established that T-cell-derived IL-31 induces severe pruritus and inflammation by binding to the IL-31 receptor and activating transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) expressing C-fiber nociceptors, as well as keratinocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils[33].

The role of IL-31 in diabetic itch appears particularly important given that IL-31, IL-4, and nerve growth factor (NGF) function as downstream mediators of itch-related inflammatory factors that directly stimulate TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channels[20][27][57]. During pathological states such as diabetes, these pruritogenic inflammatory factors stimulate TRPV1 and TRPA1 repeatedly, resulting in a decreased threshold for itch sensation and the development of chronic itch[20][27]. The neuroimmune feedback loop perpetuating chronic itch involves neuropeptides released from nerve fibers in the skin that cause vasodilation and further recruitment of inflammatory cells, which in turn degranulate and release neurotoxins as well as nerve growth factor[56][57]. This neuronal growth factor contributes to neuronal hyperplasia observed in the dermis of PN patients and mediates neural sensitization[56][57].

Interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, classical T helper 2 cytokines, drive atopic inflammation and significantly contribute to neural dysregulation in both PN and diabetic itch pathophysiology[8][24][35]. Both IL-4 and IL-13 act through the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα), a shared receptor subunit common to type I and type II receptors for these cytokines[15][35]. At the keratinocyte level, IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit the expression of epidermal barrier proteins including filaggrin, loricrin, and involucrin through downstream signaling pathways, thereby compromising skin barrier integrity[50][53]. Beyond direct barrier effects, IL-4 and IL-13 induce production of periostin, an extracellular matrix protein involved in type 2 inflammation that is significantly increased in the dermis and peripheral blood plasma of PN patients and correlates with pruritus intensity[24][56]. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing studies revealed that PN lesions exhibit upregulated periostin signaling through the neuronal integrin αVβ3 receptor, which has been demonstrated in mouse models to directly stimulate itch sensation[24][56].

Methylglyoxal (MGO), an endogenous reactive carbonyl compound generated as a byproduct of multiple metabolic pathways including glycolysis and lipid peroxidation, represents a particularly important mechanistic link between hyperglycemia and pruritus. Elevated plasma MGO levels exceeding 800 nanomoles per liter have been documented in diabetic patients[52]. MGO mediates rapid non-enzymatic glycation of proteins, lipids, and DNA to promote AGE formation, ultimately rendering irreversible damage to macromolecules and compromising their structural integrity and function[52]. Peripheral nerves demonstrate particular susceptibility to MGO toxicity due to low glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) activity in these tissues[52]. In mechanistic studies, intradermal injection of MGO induced dose-dependent scratching behavior in normal mice, while direct MGO application activated TRPA1 ion channels to induce inward currents and calcium influx in dorsal root ganglia neurons[52]. Genetic ablation of Trpa1, pharmacological TRPA1 blockade, antioxidants, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors all abrogated MGO-induced itch in experimental diabetic models[52]. These findings demonstrate that MGO-mediated TRPA1 activation represents a fundamental mechanism linking hyperglycemia-generated metabolic byproducts to sensory neuron activation and pruritus.

### Epidermal Barrier Dysfunction and Cutaneous Inflammation

Type 2 diabetes induces multiple alterations in epidermal structure and function that predispose to both enhanced susceptibility to chronic pruritic conditions and amplification of existing itch. Individuals with T2DM display characteristic epidermal dysfunction including reduced stratum corneum hydration, increased skin surface pH, and delayed permeability barrier recovery[50][53]. The stratum corneum hydration defects in diabetic skin result from decreased sebum content, reduced hyaluronic acid production, diminished epidermal lipid production, and reduced expression of aquaporin 3 water channel proteins[50]. Hyaluronic acid levels in diabetic mice plasma are 25 to 70 percent lower than in non-diabetic controls, potentially due to increased hyaluronidase activity[50]. This finding has particular relevance to chronic pruritus given that topical or oral administration of hyaluronic acid improves stratum corneum hydration and reduces itch sensation[50].

The consequences of reduced stratum corneum hydration extend beyond simple dryness to encompass enhanced cutaneous inflammation. Previous studies have demonstrated that epidermal functional abnormalities provoke and exacerbate cutaneous inflammation, potentially leading to systemic inflammatory responses[50]. Specifically, reduced stratum corneum hydration leads to increased levels of cytokines and histamine accompanied by inflammatory infiltration in the skin[50]. A mechanism-based explanation suggests that lower stratum corneum hydration occurs with T2DM and provokes increased density of mast cells (a sign of cutaneous inflammation) in the skin[50]. The increased histamine and elevated cytokine levels can directly induce pruritus, creating a feedback loop whereby initial barrier dysfunction promotes immune activation and itch sensation[50]. Correspondingly, approximately 90 percent of patients with T2DM experience chronic itch, with intensity correlating with fasting plasma glucose levels[50]. Prolonged dry skin and repeated scratching perpetuate this vicious cycle by constantly stimulating skin to release cytokines; sustained cytokine release from the skin can eventually increase cytokine levels in circulation, leading to systemic inflammation[50].

Elevated skin surface pH observed in T2DM represents an independent contributor to epidermal dysfunction and enhanced pruritus susceptibility. The increased pH (decreased acidity) of diabetic skin alone can delay epidermal permeability barrier recovery and worsen cutaneous inflammation[50]. This elevated pH potentially results from decreased sebum content and altered production of acidic substances that normally maintain the skin's acid mantle[50]. The higher pH environment may enhance proliferation of certain cutaneous bacteria and alter the composition of skin microbiota, potentially contributing to enhanced inflammatory responses. High glucose levels themselves can increase secretion of cytokines by keratinocytes and contribute to epidermal dysfunction[50], creating a feedback loop whereby high glucose–epidermal dysfunction–inflammation can worsen the underlying diabetic disease state[50].

### Immune-Mediated Mechanisms and Th2 Polarization

Both LSC and PN are characterized by dysregulated type 2 immune responses, with mechanisms that are exacerbated or amplified in the setting of concurrent T2DM. The characteristic immune infiltrate in PN lesions includes diverse immune cells such as neutrophils, basophils, mast cells, eosinophils, and fibroblasts activated through T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, and Th22 pathways[56]. Mast cells and eosinophils frequently aggregate in close proximity to peripheral sensory nerve endings in PN lesions, establishing direct anatomical sites for neuroimmune crosstalk[56]. These inflammatory cells release multiple mediators including tryptase, eosinophil cationic protein, histamine, prostaglandins, and neuropeptides that contribute to the robust inflammatory response and intense itching characteristic of PN[24][56].

Gene expression analysis has demonstrated upregulation of Th1, Th17, and Th22 markers in lesional PN skin[56]. IL-17, produced by Th17 cells, induces endothelin-1, a histamine-independent pruritogen, while IL-22 drives epidermal differentiation, cutaneous inflammation, and keratinocyte proliferation[56]. Increased IL-22 release has been noted from circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in populations with PN, particularly in predominantly African American populations[56]. The Th2 response predominates in classic PN and LSC presentations, characterized by high expression of GATA3 transcription factor and subsequent secretion of related cytokines that orchestrate type 2 immune responses and promote inflammation[35][53][56]. The IL-4 and IL-13 axis activates multiple downstream pathways through IL-4 receptor signaling, creating positive feedback loops that amplify and sustain type 2 inflammatory responses[35][53].

In the context of T2DM, type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) have been characterized as important regulators with pleiotropic effects on glucose homeostasis and tissue inflammation. ILC2s suppress harmful inflammation in T2DM through production of type 2 cytokines including IL-5 and IL-13, which stimulate eosinophil production and differentiation of macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes in white adipose tissue[32]. However, the dysregulation of ILC2 function in diabetic states, particularly in the context of chronic cutaneous inflammation from conditions like PN and LSC, may represent a failure of these normally protective mechanisms, resulting in unchecked type 2 inflammatory responses in the skin[32].

### Neuronal Sensitization and Central Sensitization Mechanisms

Chronic pruritic conditions like LSC and PN are fundamentally disorders of neural dysregulation characterized by both peripheral and central sensitization of itch pathways[7][24][27]. LSC is characterized as a chronic, localized pruritic disorder driven by neural sensitization and sustained inflammatory signaling, with the itch-scratch cycle as its hallmark[7]. This cycle is initiated by persistent scratching, which leads to skin barrier disruption, lichenification, and neuroimmune dysregulation[7]. The itch experienced in LSC is primarily mediated by protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and type 2 inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31[7][20]. IL-31 activates ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channels on C-fibers, transmitting pruritic signals to the spinal cord[7][20].

Chronic activation of immune cascades triggered by either primary or secondary drivers of itch has been linked to increased expression of inflammatory mediators implicated in LSC pathogenesis, including delta- and notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER), matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)[7][24]. Genetic and neuroimmune factors appear to contribute to LSC pathogenesis, with evidence suggesting that variants in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), particularly the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, result in reduced serotonin reuptake and prolonged serotonergic signaling[7]. This genotype appears less common in LSC, suggesting that enhanced central serotonergic activity may confer protective effects against itch[7]. Furthermore, LSC has been associated with distinct patterns of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) DNA methylation in keratinocytes, indicating potential epigenetic biomarkers of disease[7].

Psychological distress amplifies the itch-scratch cycle in LSC through dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and reduced levels of neurotrophins essential for neuronal health, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), nerve growth factor (NGF), and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the central nervous system[7]. BDNF in particular has been increasingly linked to chronic itch in both translational and epidemiological studies[7]. The relationship between psychological stress and neurotrophin insufficiency appears bidirectional, whereby chronic stress reduces neurotrophin production and impaired neurotrophin signaling enhances stress sensitivity. In T2DM specifically, hyperglycemia has been demonstrated to downregulate BDNF expression through inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway, leading to enhanced expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 and thus further downregulating BDNF[30]. BDNF deficiency in Schwann cells plays a critical role in the development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, suggesting a mechanistic overlap between diabetic neuropathy and diabetic itch[30].

Emerging evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the skin microbiome may represent another driver of chronic inflammation in LSC and potentially in diabetic skin conditions more broadly[7]. Sixteen S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing of LSC and PN lesions that were not atopic revealed reduced alpha-diversity across 615 bacterial species (290 genera, 29 classes, and 13 phyla), with a relative overabundance of *Staphylococcus aureus* and a decreased prevalence of commensal organisms (*Cutibacterium acnes*, *Staphylococcus hominis*) compared with healthy skin[7]. The overgrowth of *S. aureus* may contribute to enhanced inflammation through production of virulence factors and triggering of pattern recognition receptors on immune and epithelial cells, establishing a link between microbiome dysbiosis, cutaneous inflammation, and pruritus[7].

## Confounding Factors and Potential Sources of Bias in Observed Associations

### Age, Sex, and Demographic Confounding

Substantial epidemiological overlap exists between risk factors for T2DM and risk factors for chronic pruritic skin conditions, raising the possibility that previously observed associations reflect confounding by shared demographic characteristics rather than direct biological relationships. Both LSC and PN predominantly affect middle-aged to older adults, with LSC affecting approximately 12 percent of the general population, particularly prevalent among individuals aged 30 to 50 years[37][40]. Women demonstrate higher prevalence of LSC compared with men, at a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1[37][40]. Similarly, PN demonstrates a higher prevalence in females compared with males, with a peak occurrence between ages 50 and 59 years[17][29]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus likewise demonstrates age-related and sex-related patterns of prevalence, with greater incidence in older adults and somewhat different sex distributions across populations. A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study investigating lichen sclerosus (a related lichenoid condition) and T2DM explicitly hypothesized that the high-risk population comprises menopausal women and middle-aged men, coinciding with the typical onset ages of both T2DM and lichenoid skin conditions, potentially leading to spurious associations[25].

### Obesity and Metabolic Dysregulation as Shared Pathways

Body mass index represents a potentially critical confounder in the association between T2DM and chronic pruritic skin conditions. Both T2DM and conditions like PN are strongly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. In the LSC study, 66 percent of the cohort were either overweight or obese[28][37]. Recent investigations have highlighted the role of obesity in exacerbating inflammatory pathways that can lead to increased itch severity in certain chronic pruritic conditions[28]. Obesity is not identified as a major factor in LSC specifically except in the context of psoriasis and prurigo nodularis[28]. However, in prurigo nodularis, obesity is associated with higher disease prevalence and may intensify pruritic symptoms through effects on systemic inflammation[28]. PN is specifically associated with higher rates of obesity, which may intensify pruritic symptoms and is linked to systemic conditions like cardiovascular disease[28]. Obesity contributes to a pro-inflammatory state through secretion of adipokines and cytokines, which can worsen symptoms of inflammatory conditions and reduce treatment efficacy[28].

The potential confounding by obesity appears particularly important given that metabolic syndrome encompasses multiple components including T2DM, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. In the LSC cohort, the prevalence of hypertension was 61 percent compared with approximately 45 percent in the general U.S. adult population, while T2DM was present in 30 percent versus 11 percent nationally[28][37]. These findings suggest that LSC patients may represent a population with elevated cardiometabolic risk overall, which could contribute to the chronicity and severity of their dermatological disease through multiple overlapping inflammatory pathways[28][37].

### Medication Effects and Treatment-Related Confounding

Multiple medications used in the treatment of T2DM and associated metabolic complications may independently influence the development or severity of chronic pruritic skin conditions. Older oral hypoglycemic agents have been postulated as potential contributors to the observed association between diabetes and oral lichen planus based on case reports and observational studies, though definitive causal evidence remains lacking[42]. Similarly, medications used to treat diabetic complications (such as statins for dyslipidemia or ACE inhibitors for hypertension) may have independent effects on cutaneous immune responses or pruritus that could confound the observed association. The cross-sectional nature of many epidemiological studies examining these comorbidities limits the ability to disentangle medication effects from disease effects.

### Reverse Causality and Psychosomatic Mechanisms

The temporal directionality of the T2DM-chronic pruritic skin condition relationship remains incompletely characterized. While many studies document increased prevalence of T2DM in populations with LSC or PN, fewer studies have examined whether chronic pruritic skin conditions increase the subsequent risk of developing T2DM. One possibility involves reverse causality whereby the intense pruritus and resulting sleep disruption characteristic of PN and LSC contribute to impaired glucose metabolism and development of T2DM. Patients with PN commonly experience severe sleep disruption due to nighttime symptoms, and sleep deprivation has been independently associated with impaired glucose tolerance and increased T2DM risk. The LSC study specifically documented that nearly 90 percent of patients experienced daily pruritus with approximately 50 percent experiencing itch during both day and night, and 14 percent reporting only nighttime symptoms[37][40]. Such disruption of normal sleep-wake cycles may contribute to dysregulation of circadian glucose homeostasis and metabolic dysfunction.

Psychological distress represents another potential bidirectional mechanism linking these conditions. The LSC and PN studies documented markedly elevated prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities including generalized anxiety disorder (50% of LSC patients versus ~3% in U.S. population), major depressive disorder (44% versus ~8%), and obsessive-compulsive disorder[4][28][37][40]. These psychiatric conditions themselves have been associated with impaired metabolic control and increased T2DM risk, raising the possibility that psychological distress represents a shared risk factor driving both the development of chronic pruritic skin conditions and metabolic dysfunction[34]. The bidirectional relationship between psychological distress and chronic pruritus suggests that addressing psychiatric comorbidities may represent an important component of comprehensive management for these patients[28][34][37].

### Diagnostic and Classification Confounding

Heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria and disease classification across studies examining these associations may introduce bias. Different studies have applied varying diagnostic criteria for PN and LSC, potentially affecting estimates of prevalence and association strength. The systematic review and meta-analysis examining chronic prurigo comorbidities synthesized data from 17 studies with heterogeneous study methodologies and settings[5][43]. The wide confidence intervals observed for some effect estimates (such as the diabetes estimate of pooled OR 4.93; 95% CI = 1.13-21.56) indicate substantial heterogeneity that may reflect genuine differences in study populations, diagnostic approaches, or disease classification[5][43]. Additionally, ICD and SNOMED coding variability across different healthcare systems and geographic regions may have affected identification of cases and controls in database studies, potentially biasing effect estimates in either direction depending on the sensitivity and specificity of coding systems employed.

## Specific Skin Manifestations of Diabetes and Related Comorbid Pruritic Conditions

### Acanthosis Nigricans and Its Relationship to Pruritic Skin Disease

Acanthosis nigricans (AN) represents one of the most frequently encountered cutaneous manifestations of diabetes and insulin resistance, characterized by thickened, hyperpigmented, velvety skin most commonly affecting intertriginous areas. The pathogenesis of AN in diabetes is multifactorial, with well-established mechanisms involving direct activation of insulin growth factor receptors, particularly IGF-1, on keratinocytes and fibroblasts, provoking cell proliferation[1][11][45]. Hyperinsulinemia also decreases circulating levels of IGF binding protein 1 and 2, increasing IGF-1 blood levels for the same proliferative effect[1][11][45]. Beyond insulin resistance-related mechanisms, AN can be associated with malignancies such as gastric adenocarcinomas and genitourinary cancers, as well as with autoimmune disorders, various medications, and familial disorders[1][11]. In a study involving 750 diabetic patients, the most frequently reported skin issues were cutaneous infections (47.5%), xerosis (26.4%), and inflammatory skin disorders (20.7%), with acanthosis nigricans representing a significant proportion of these manifestations particularly in type 2 diabetes[3].

The relationship between acanthosis nigricans and chronic pruritic conditions like LSC and PN may operate through shared insulin resistance pathways. A recent study assessing dermatological manifestations in type 2 diabetes based on disease duration found that acanthosis nigricans showed a highly significant variation (p < 0.001), predominantly affecting patients with shorter disease duration (Groups A and B: 82 patients [63.1%] and 80 patients [61.5%] respectively)[3]. This finding supports AN's recognized association with insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Interestingly, the prevalence of acanthosis nigricans in this cohort (63.1-61.5%) was notably higher than other reported studies, which have documented AN prevalence between 18 and 19 percent[3]. This discordance may reflect differences in study populations, diabetes duration, or racial/ethnic demographics, as some populations demonstrate higher AN prevalence than others.

### Diabetic Dermopathy and Its Distinction from Pruritic Conditions

Diabetic dermopathy (DD), characterized by atrophic macules or patches typically appearing on the anterior shins, represents another common cutaneous manifestation of diabetes that warrants distinction from purely pruritic conditions. Although DD may antecede the onset of clinical diabetes, it occurs more frequently as a late complication in patients with microvascular disease[1]. Importantly, DD often occurs prior to the onset of neuropathy and retinopathy, while nephropathy is regularly present in patients with DD[1]. An association with cardiovascular disease has been identified, with one study showing 53 percent of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with DD had coexisting coronary artery disease[1]. Unlike LSC and PN, which are primarily characterized by severe pruritus, DD typically presents as asymptomatic skin lesions, though pruritus has been occasionally reported. The distinction between DD and pruritic conditions carries important clinical significance for appropriate disease classification and management.

### Necrobiosis Lipoidica and Its Comorbidity Profile

Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) represents another rare but diagnostically significant cutaneous manifestation of diabetes characterized by collagen degeneration with lesions typically occurring on the anterior tibial surfaces. The incidence of NL in diabetic patients is 0.3 to 1.2 percent; NL precedes diabetes in approximately 14 percent of patients, occurs simultaneously in up to 24 percent, and follows diabetes diagnosis in 62 percent of patients[9][36]. For unknown reasons, NL exhibits a strong predilection for women compared with men[9][36]. NL generally occurs in type 1 diabetes during the third decade of life, whereas in type 2 diabetes it commonly presents in the fourth or fifth decades[9][36]. A German retrospective study assessing comorbidities in 98 patients with NL discovered that 53 patients (54%) had a history of diabetes; notably, five of these patients experienced the onset of diabetic symptoms subsequent to their first NL diagnosis[9]. Within this subset, type 1 diabetes was found in 22 patients (22.4% of all NL patients) and type 2 diabetes in 25 patients (25.5% of all NL patients)[9].

The one study evaluating comorbidities and diabetic complications in NL patients found notably elevated rates of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, thyroid disease, poor kidney function, and poor glucose control[1][9][58]. The highest comorbidity rates in patients with NL were observed in those with type 2 diabetes[1][9][58]. These findings suggest that NL may serve as a marker for severe metabolic dysfunction and associated cardiovascular disease risk, distinguishing it from the purely pruritic manifestations seen in LSC and PN. Unlike LSC and PN where pruritus represents the cardinal symptom, NL typically presents with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic lesions that may ulcerate in approximately one-third of patients, potentially leading to serious complications including secondary infection, gangrene, osteomyelitis, and in extreme cases, lower extremity amputation[1].

## Neuroinflammatory Underpinnings and Shared Molecular Signatures

### Peripheral Sensitization and Small Fiber Neuropathy

The mechanism of mechanical itch, also known as touch-evoked itch, represents a notable feature of chronic itch in diabetic neuropathy and chronic pruritic conditions[27][57]. Evidence suggests that mechanical itch is related to central sensitization, wherein repeated nociceptive input produces progressive amplification of pain/itch signals in the spinal cord and brain[27][57]. In diabetes mellitus, mechanical itch may arise through multiple mechanisms including activation of small-diameter unmyelinated C-fibers through expression of TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels, which are activated by reactive compounds generated during diabetes such as methylglyoxal and other AGE precursors[27][49][52].

Neuroinflammatory mechanisms contribute substantially to the chronic itch and neuropathic manifestations observed in both LSC/PN and diabetes. The inflammation in the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system is characterized by increased permeability of the blood-spinal cord barrier and blood-brain barrier, infiltration of leukocytes as a result of increased vascular permeability, secretion and production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, and activation of glial cells causing production of glial mediators that regulate pain sensitivity[27]. Under diabetic neuropathy conditions, microglial cells transform to a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which releases pro-inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), further amplifying nociceptive signal transmission in the spinal dorsal horn and promoting mechanical hypersensitivity[27].

The astrocyte-IL-1β-NMDAR-neuron axis has been identified as a novel mechanism underlying astrocyte-induced allodynia (pain or itch from normally non-noxious stimuli)[27]. In T2DM rats, upregulation of purinergic signaling promotes activation of satellite glial cells in dorsal root ganglia, increases TNF-α release from these glial cells, and enhances excitability of dorsal root ganglion neurons, culminating in heightened pain sensitivity that likely parallels mechanisms driving heightened itch sensitivity[27]. Potassium channels act as important brakes on the excitability of sensory neurons; T-type calcium channels have been found to play important roles in peripheral diabetic neuropathy by regulating nociceptor excitability in the subthreshold range[27]. The activity of Cav3.2 calcium channels is increased in diabetes through glycosylation of arginine residues within extracellular membranes, causing dorsal root ganglion neurons to become hyperexcitable[27].

### Glial Cell Activation and Neuroimmune Crosstalk

Schwann cells and satellite glial cells maintain critical roles in peripheral nerve function and are profoundly affected by hyperglycemia and metabolic dysfunction. Under hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia conditions, the regulatory functions of Schwann cells, particularly cell autophagy and cell metabolism, are impaired, and mitochondrial dysfunction ensues[30]. Without the protection and support of glial cells such as Schwann cells, sensory neurons become more vulnerable to injury than motor neurons, particularly neurons in the dorsal root ganglion[30]. Evidence demonstrates that levels of CXCR3 and phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy are significantly increased[27]. CXCR3 is elevated in CD8(+) T cells via p-p38 under high glucose conditions, and then promotes CD8(+) T-cell recruitment into diabetic nerves by chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 produced by glucose-stimulated Schwann cells[27]. This infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes into diabetic nerves may contribute to neuronal injury and dysfunction, establishing a mechanism linking hyperglycemia to peripheral neuroinflammation.

Satellite glial cells contact one another and enwrap neuronal somata in ganglia; deterioration of this communication among satellite glial cells under pathological conditions leads to abnormal pain signal transmission[27]. The activation of satellite glial cells and Schwann cells produces excessive quantities of pro-inflammatory mediators that can directly activate sensory C-fibers and cause abnormal discharges from peripheral nerves, ultimately producing paraesthesia and pruritus[27]. These neuroimmune mechanisms likely contribute substantially to the exacerbation of pruritic symptoms in individuals with concurrent T2DM and LSC or PN.

## Systemic Inflammation and Cross-Organ Comorbidities

### Cardiovascular Disease Association

Both chronic pruritic skin conditions and T2DM are characterized by underlying systemic inflammation, and this inflammatory state appears to link dermatological disease to cardiovascular complications. In the PN cohort studies, prevalence of coronary heart disease was significantly higher for PN patients compared with controls (relative risk = 1.575; 95% CI = 1.388-1.787)[2][26][38]. Furthermore, subsequent risk of coronary heart disease was significantly increased in PN patients following their diagnosis (hazard ratio = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.09-1.74)[2][26]. These findings demonstrate that PN not only co-occurs with cardiovascular disease but appears associated with increased subsequent risk of developing coronary heart disease after PN diagnosis. Similarly, in the LSC cohort, cardiovascular comorbidities were prominent, with hypertension present in 61 percent of patients[28][37][40].

The mechanistic link between cutaneous inflammation and systemic cardiovascular disease appears to involve elevated circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Sustained release of cytokines from the skin can eventually increase cytokine levels in circulation, leading to systemic inflammation[50]. The pro-inflammatory state originating in chronically affected skin may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis progression through multiple mechanisms including enhanced oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide availability, and promotion of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation[50]. This vicious cycle, wherein cutaneous inflammation drives systemic inflammation that exacerbates metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, highlights the systemic significance of even localized pruritic skin conditions.

### Chronic Kidney Disease Comorbidity

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents another significant comorbidity in both PN and T2DM populations. In PN cohort studies, prevalence of chronic kidney disease was significantly higher for PN patients compared with controls (relative risk = 1.529; 95% CI = 1.329-1.759)[2][26][38]. A systematic review and meta-analysis examining comorbidities with chronic prurigo found an even more pronounced association with chronic kidney disease (pooled odds ratio = 4.16; 95% CI = 1.79-9.66), suggesting that renal dysfunction may be particularly strongly associated with chronic pruritic conditions[5][43][46]. The relationship between PN and CKD appears bidirectional, with approximately 18 to 60 percent of chronic kidney disease patients affected by chronic itch depending on geographic region and itch definition[33]. In a study of chronic pruritus due to chronic renal failure, over half of patients exhibited PN, particularly those with longer renal failure duration[33]. A representative prospective cross-sectional study in hemodialysis patients found that 10 percent demonstrated excoriations and scratched nodules with the typical clinical picture of PN[33].

The mechanistic link between CKD and enhanced pruritus involves multiple factors including uremia, altered electrolyte balance, dysregulation of calcium-phosphate metabolism, and accumulation of uremic toxins that may activate pruritic signaling pathways. The increased prevalence of CKD in PN patients may partly reflect the severe inflammatory state in PN leading to renal disease through mechanisms of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress[2][26]. Alternatively, renal dysfunction may enhance skin disease severity by leading to accumulation of pruritic uremic compounds. The study findings demonstrated that patients receiving dialysis had higher incidence of PN, suggesting that severity of CKD (as measured by need for dialysis) acts as a marker of severity[17]. This positioning of CKD as a potentially important cofactor in PN-associated pruritus highlights the systemic nature of pruritic dermatological diseases and their integration with metabolic dysfunction.

## Contemporary Treatment Approaches and Emerging Therapeutics

### Immunomodulatory and Biologic Agents

Recognition of the critical roles of specific cytokines in the pathogenesis of both T2DM-associated skin complications and chronic pruritic conditions has led to development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies. The biologic agent dupilumab, an IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) monoclonal antibody that simultaneously blocks IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, has demonstrated efficacy in treating various manifestations of atopic and non-atopic pruritic disease[15][21][24]. Clinical trial evidence demonstrates that 49.7 percent of PN patients treated with dupilumab achieved clinically meaningful improvement (≥4-point drop on Numerical Rating Scale for Skin Pain) compared with 20.9 percent receiving placebo, demonstrating significant reduction in both itch and pain[24].

The biologic agent nemolizumab, an anti-IL-31 receptor antibody, represents another emerging therapeutic targeting cytokine-mediated pruritus. Recent clinical trial data showed lesion improvement for PN patients receiving nemolizumab treatment[8][33]. The nemolizumab results validate IL-31 as a central pathogenic factor within the PN neuroimmune network[8][33]. JAK inhibitors, which broadly inhibit Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (JAK-STAT) signaling downstream of multiple cytokine receptors including IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 receptors, represent another therapeutic approach showing promise in treating chronic pruritic conditions[7][11]. Several JAK inhibitors have entered clinical trials for PN and atopic dermatitis, targeting the fundamental signaling pathways driving type 2 inflammatory responses.

### Metabolic-Targeted Therapies

Given the strong association between T2DM and chronic pruritic conditions, optimization of glycemic control represents a fundamental therapeutic goal applicable to all patients with both conditions. In patients with necrobiosis lipoidica specifically, very tight blood glucose control has been suggested to result in narrowing of thickened skin associated with scleroderma-like changes[11]. Additionally, aldose reductase inhibitors, which limit increases in sugar alcohols through inhibition of the polyol pathway, may be efficacious for various diabetic skin complications[11]. The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has been reported in case reports to be effective in improving the clinical appearance of acanthosis nigricans[1][11], suggesting that intensive metabolic management may improve associated dermatological manifestations.

Management of comorbid metabolic complications including obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension in patients with both T2DM and chronic pruritic skin conditions represents an important therapeutic target. Weight reduction through lifestyle modification or pharmacologic intervention may help reduce the pro-inflammatory adipokine and cytokine secretion that characterizes obesity and contributes to both metabolic dysfunction and cutaneous inflammation[28]. Statins used for dyslipidemia management may have anti-inflammatory properties that could benefit cutaneous disease, though such effects have not been specifically studied in LSC or PN.

### Neuromodulatory Approaches

Given the critical role of neural sensitization in both PN/LSC and diabetic neuropathy, neuromodulatory approaches targeting ion channel function or neuropeptide signaling represent important therapeutic frontiers. Targeting the TRPA1 ion channel, which has been demonstrated to mediate mechanical itch in diabetic itch through activation by methylglyoxal and other reactive compounds, represents a promising disease-modifying treatment approach for diabetic pruritus[49][52]. The TRPA1 antagonists Chembridge-5861528 and A-967079 have shown antihypersensitivity effects and prevention of development of pain hypersensitivity in diabetic animal models[49]. Additionally, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists may provide benefit by blocking neuropeptide-mediated neurogenic inflammation and mast cell activation[56][59].

## Conclusion: Integration of Current Evidence and Clinical Implications

The substantial epidemiological association between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the chronic pruritic skin conditions lichen simplex chronicus and prurigo nodularis reflects both shared environmental and metabolic risk factors and multiple overlapping biological mechanisms linking metabolic dysfunction to dermatological disease. Statistical evidence demonstrates a relative risk of approximately 1.8 to 1.9 for type 2 diabetes in patients with PN, and a prevalence approaching 30 percent in patients with LSC compared with 11 percent in the general population. These associations extend beyond simple comorbidity to reflect genuine biological interconnection through shared pathways of inflammation, neuroimmune dysregulation, and metabolic dysregulation.

At the molecular level, advanced glycation end products generated during prolonged hyperglycemia directly damage dermal and epidermal structure through mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species generation, fibroblast apoptosis, and alterations in extracellular matrix homeostasis. The methylglyoxal metabolite produced from glycolytic pathway dysregulation in diabetes directly activates TRPA1 ion channels on sensory neurons, driving both itch and pain sensation. Type 2 inflammatory cytokines including IL-4, IL-13, and particularly IL-31 mediate neural sensitization and recruit mast cells and eosinophils that establish direct anatomical associations with sensory nerve endings in both PN and diabetic skin, amplifying the itch signal through neuroimmune feedback loops. Epidermal barrier dysfunction occurring in T2DM through reduced hyaluronic acid production, diminished filaggrin expression, and elevated skin pH creates an environment predisposed to enhanced mast cell activation and inflammatory cell infiltration, thereby amplifying cutaneous and systemic inflammation.

Yet the temporal relationship between T2DM and chronic pruritic skin conditions remains incompletely characterized. While cross-sectional studies consistently demonstrate elevated prevalence of T2DM in LSC and PN populations, bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses suggest that shared demographic and metabolic risk factors rather than direct causal relationships may explain observed associations. Age, obesity, and metabolic syndrome components represent critical confounders that must be carefully controlled in future prospective studies. The elevated prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in both LSC and PN populations raises the possibility that psychological distress represents a shared driver of metabolic dysfunction and chronic pruritic disease, potentially through mechanisms involving stress hormone dysregulation and impaired sleep quality.

For clinical management, patients presenting with either LSC or PN should undergo systematic evaluation for T2DM and dysglycemia if not already known, as these conditions appear to identify populations at heightened metabolic risk. Conversely, diabetic patients with chronic pruritus warrant dermatological evaluation to distinguish between pruritus secondary to xerosis or diabetic neuropathy versus primary pruritic dermatoses like LSC and PN that may benefit from immunomodulatory therapy. The recognition that these dermatological conditions are frequently associated with systemic comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and psychiatric illness should prompt comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation and management. Emerging immunomodulatory biologic therapies targeting IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 signaling offer promise for treating both conditions and may simultaneously address underlying cutaneous inflammation and systemic inflammation contributing to metabolic dysfunction. Future prospective longitudinal studies employing molecular phenotyping and mechanistic biomarker assessment would advance understanding of causal relationships and optimal therapeutic targets for managing this prevalent and burdensome comorbidity pattern.
