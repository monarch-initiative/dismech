# Comprehensive Pathophysiology of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome: Molecular Mechanisms, Cellular Disruptions, and Multi-System Disease Manifestations

## Executive Summary

22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS), historically recognized as DiGeorge syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome, represents one of the most common human chromosomal microdeletions, occurring in approximately 1 in 4,000 live births[1][2][3]. The syndrome results from a hemizygous microdeletion spanning 1.5 to 3.0 megabases on chromosome 22, encompassing more than 30 protein-coding genes and multiple non-coding regulatory elements[1][2][3]. This chromosomal lesion disrupts the coordinated development of structures derived from the pharyngeal apparatus and neural crest tissues, leading to a highly heterogeneous constellation of clinical manifestations affecting multiple organ systems including the heart, immune system, endocrine glands, skeleton, and central nervous system[1][2][3]. The pathophysiology of 22q11.2DS reflects not a single gene defect but rather the cumulative haploinsufficiency of multiple genes acting on common cellular mechanisms during critical developmental windows, with primary causality attributed to the TBX1 gene and modifying contributions from genes such as COMT, PRODH, DGCR8, and CLDN5[2][3][4]. Recent molecular research has identified disruptions in brain metabolism, mitochondrial function, microRNA biogenesis, and blood-brain barrier integrity as central mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric vulnerability observed in 22q11.2DS patients, particularly the markedly elevated risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders[5][6][7][8]. This comprehensive report synthesizes current understanding of 22q11.2DS pathophysiology by integrating molecular, cellular, developmental, and systems-level mechanisms that collectively explain the diverse and variable clinical phenotypes characterizing this complex genetic disorder.

## Chromosomal Architecture and Genetic Basis of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome

### Structural Organization of the Deleted Region

The 22q11.2 region exhibits a unique genomic architecture defined by the presence of four major low-copy-number repeats (LCRs) designated LCR22A, LCR22B, LCR22C, and LCR22D[2][3]. These repetitive elements, ranging in size from approximately 200 to 300 kilobases, flank distinct genomic intervals and predispose the region to nonallelic homologous recombination, the primary mechanism by which 22q11.2 deletions arise[3][8]. The most common deletion encompasses the approximately 3-megabase interval flanked by LCR22A and LCR22D, affecting approximately 85 percent of individuals with the syndrome[3][8]. This typical "proximal" deletion is hemizygous in nature, meaning affected individuals retain only a single copy of genes within this region rather than the normal pair of homologous chromosomes[1][2][3]. Approximately 10 percent of cases present with smaller nested deletions between LCR22A and LCR22B, termed the 1.5-megabase minimal critical region, while distal deletions involving the LCR22B-D or LCR22C-D intervals account for a smaller proportion of cases[3][8]. The complex LCR architecture of chromosome 22q11.2 appears to function as a chromatin assembly hub with epigenetic regulatory properties, with emerging evidence suggesting that these repetitive elements regulate expression of more than 300 genes located at distinct chromosomal locations beyond the deleted region itself[39]. This long-range regulatory capacity may explain some of the remarkable phenotypic variability observed even among individuals carrying identical deletion breakpoints.

The 22q11.2 region contains more than 45 protein-coding genes, though only approximately 30 to 40 of these undergo complete hemizygous loss in typical proximal deletions[1][2][3]. The deleted region also encompasses seven microRNAs, 38 non-coding RNAs, and 53 pseudogenes[14], representing a complex assemblage of regulatory elements whose disruption contributes to the multisystem pathology of the syndrome[2]. Key protein-coding genes within the minimal critical deleted region include TBX1, COMT, PRODH, DGCR8, CRKL, CLDN5, HIRA, CDC45, ARVCF, and others[1][2][14]. These genes exhibit distinct patterns of tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific expression, suggesting that different genes contribute to different phenotypic features through both overlapping and distinct cellular mechanisms[11][14]. The deletion extends beyond the minimal critical region in many patients, encompassing additional genes such as SMARCB1, which when deleted carries increased risk for malignant rhabdoid tumors[6][14].

### TBX1 as the Central Candidate Gene

Among the genes within the deleted 22q11.2 region, T-box transcription factor 1 (TBX1) has emerged as the primary candidate responsible for most of the characteristic clinical features of 22q11.2DS, particularly the cardiac, thymic, parathyroid, and craniofacial abnormalities[2][41]. TBX1 encodes a T-box family transcription factor that plays essential roles during early embryogenesis in regulating the development of structures derived from the pharyngeal apparatus[2][3][41]. During the critical developmental window of embryonic days 9.5 to 11.5 in mice (corresponding approximately to weeks 7 to 8 of human gestation), TBX1 is expressed at high levels in the pharyngeal mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm, as well as in the surrounding head mesenchyme[2][3][41]. This spatiotemporal expression pattern precisely overlaps with the developmental processes that generate the cardiac outflow tract, aortic arch arteries, thymus, parathyroid glands, and craniofacial structures[2][3][41]. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations affecting TBX1 specifically have been identified in rare cases of DiGeorge-like phenotypes, demonstrating that haploinsufficiency of this single gene can recapitulate many features of the full syndrome[2][41]. Complete loss of TBX1 function in knockout mouse models results in embryonic lethality with manifestation of the full spectrum of 22q11.2DS features including persistent truncus arteriosus, cleft palate, and complete absence of the thymus and parathyroid glands[2][3].

Conditional mutagenesis studies employing tissue-specific deletion of TBX1 have revealed that this gene operates through non-autonomous mechanisms requiring its expression in multiple tissue types for proper development[2][3]. Deletion of TBX1 specifically in the mesoderm recapitulates cardiac, thymic, and parathyroid defects, while deletion in the pharyngeal surface ectoderm or endoderm produces overlapping but distinct phenotypes[2][3]. These findings demonstrate the complexity of TBX1 function and suggest that the characteristic features of 22q11.2DS arise from disrupted developmental processes requiring TBX1 expression across multiple cell types and tissue layers[2]. At the cellular level, TBX1 haploinsufficiency has been shown to impair the proliferation and premature differentiation of progenitor cells, reduce neural crest cell patterning, and disrupt microvascular development within the developing brain[2][3][8]. Recent metabolomic studies have identified that TBX1 haploinsufficiency causes brain metabolic imbalance, including elevated levels of methylmalonic acid—a highly neurotoxic metabolite—and disruption of glutamine-glutamate and fatty acid metabolism[7][26]. Notably, vitamin B12 supplementation has demonstrated the ability to rescue certain brain and behavioral anomalies in TBX1 mutant mice, suggesting that targeting the metabolic consequences of TBX1 haploinsufficiency may offer therapeutic potential[7].

## Developmental Pathophysiology: Disruption of Pharyngeal Arch Development

### Neural Crest Cell Migration and Differentiation Defects

The pathophysiology of 22q11.2DS fundamentally reflects disrupted development of structures derived from the pharyngeal apparatus, which receives cellular contributions from three embryonic germ layers—the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm—as well as from neural crest cells that delaminate from the closing neural tube[3][8][19]. The neural crest cells that contribute to the pharyngeal region originate from the cranial neural folds at the level of the hindbrain and migrate ventrally into the pharyngeal arches where they differentiate into diverse cell types including skeletal elements, smooth muscle, connective tissue, and cells contributing to heart development[3][19]. During this critical developmental period, numerous gene products including TBX1 orchestrate the migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation of neural crest cells through complex signaling interactions[3][19]. Disruption of neural crest cell development in 22q11.2DS arises not primarily from direct loss of TBX1 function within the neural crest cells themselves—indeed, TBX1 is not expressed in neural crest cells—but rather from impaired development of the pharyngeal epithelium and mesenchyme that normally provide supportive signals for neural crest cell patterning and migration[2][3][8].

The paradoxical non-cell-autonomous mechanism by which 22q11.2DS disrupts neural crest development highlights the complex tissue interactions required for proper pharyngeal arch development[2][3][8]. Specifically, neural crest cell patterning is affected in conditional mutants with TBX1 deletion in both the pharyngeal surface ectoderm and the second heart field, despite the absence of TBX1 expression within the neural crest population itself[2][3]. This implies that proper differentiation and signaling output from ectodermal and mesenchymal tissues requires TBX1 function to establish the correct molecular environment for neural crest cell guidance[2][3]. The affected cellular processes include alterations in the expression of guidance cues such as morphogens and transcription factors within the pharyngeal tissues that normally direct neural crest cell migration, survival, and phenotypic specification[2][3][19]. Additionally, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process requiring coordinated changes in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, appears to be disrupted in the context of TBX1 haploinsufficiency, potentially affecting both the transition of pharyngeal endoderm into mesenchymal tissue and the behavior of migrating neural crest cells[3].

### Pharyngeal Arch Derivatives and Multisystem Involvement

The tissue disruptions consequent to abnormal neural crest development and impaired TBX1 signaling in 22q11.2DS directly affect development of the following pharyngeal arch derivatives[2][3][19]. The third pharyngeal pouch gives rise to the thymus gland and inferior parathyroid glands through interactions between pharyngeal endoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme[3][9][12]. Normal development of these structures depends critically on proper mesenchymal cell development and the establishment of appropriate tissue interactions, processes disrupted by haploinsufficiency of genes including TBX1[3][9][12]. The fourth pharyngeal arch contributes to the cardiac outflow tract through both neural crest cell populations and second heart field mesoderm[3][19]. The cardiac neural crest specifically contributes to septation and remodeling of the outflow tract, development of the aortic arch arteries, and formation of valve mesenchyme[2][3][19]. Disruption of this process through multiple mechanisms—including impaired migration, survival, proliferation, or proper differentiation of neural crest cells—results in the conotruncal cardiac defects characteristic of 22q11.2DS[2][3][19].

The craniofacial structures of the first and second pharyngeal arches derive from both neural crest cells and pharyngeal mesoderm, with skeletal elements arising from these tissues under the control of multiple transcription factors including TBX1[2][3][38]. The palatal abnormalities observed in 22q11.2DS, including cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency, reflect disrupted palatogenesis resulting from impaired mesodermal development and mesenchymal-epithelial interactions[2][3][19]. Similarly, the distinctive craniofacial features including micrognathia, abnormal ear morphology, and characteristic facial dysmorphism reflect alterations in neural crest-derived skeletal development and tissue remodeling[2][3][38]. The pharyngeal mesoderm also gives rise to muscles of the head and pharynx, and disruption of this tissue's development contributes to abnormalities in muscle development and innervation observed in 22q11.2DS patients[2][3].

## Cardiac Pathophysiology: Conotruncal Defects and Neural Crest Cell Dysfunction

### Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Cardiac Malformations

The cardiac defects observed in 22q11.2DS represent some of the most clinically significant manifestations of the syndrome, occurring in approximately 75 percent of affected individuals[31]. These defects reflect fundamental disruption of two critical developmental processes: neural crest cell contribution to cardiac outflow tract development and second heart field contribution to cardiac morphogenesis[2][3][19]. The cardiac neural crest is a population of cells that delaminate from the caudal midbrain and cranial hindbrain and migrate through the pharyngeal arches to reach the developing heart, where they contribute to formation of the cardiac outflow tract, aortic arch arteries, and portions of the heart's connective tissue[2][3][19]. During the period of active neural crest contribution to the heart, the cells migrate through the pharyngeal tissue, undergo complex interactions with endodermal and mesodermal tissues, and then enter the outflow tract where they participate in outflow tract septation—the process by which a single arterial trunk is divided into separate aortic and pulmonary arteries[2][3][19].

Multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to impaired cardiac neural crest cell development in 22q11.2DS[2][3][19]. TBX1 haploinsufficiency disrupts the development of pharyngeal mesenchyme that normally provides supportive signals to migrating neural crest cells[2][3]. Additionally, haploinsufficiency of DGCR8, which encodes a protein essential for microRNA biogenesis, results in neural crest cell-specific cardiovascular defects including persistent truncus arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch, and ventricular septal defects[2][19]. The mechanism involves elevated apoptosis of neural crest cells in the caudal pharyngeal arches immediately prior to their entry into the outflow tract, suggesting that proper miRNA processing is required for neural crest cell survival during this critical developmental window[2][19]. Similarly, disruption of CRKL, an adaptor protein in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, causes cardiovascular, craniofacial, and glandular defects characteristic of 22q11.2DS by disrupting signal transduction cascades essential for neural crest cell function[2][19].

The second heart field, a population of mesenchymal progenitor cells located in the pharyngeal mesoderm, contributes to the myocardium of the right ventricle and outflow tract through a process of sequential addition of cells to the growing heart tube[2][3][19]. Proper remodeling of the outflow tract requires reciprocal interactions between the neural crest and second heart field, processes dependent on TBX1 and other 22q11.2-encoded proteins[2][3]. TBX1 haploinsufficiency disrupts this interaction, leading to misspecification of the outflow tract along its proximal-distal axis and resulting in ectopic expression of transforming growth factor-β2 and inappropriate mesenchymal transformation of the endocardium[2][3][19]. The excess transforming growth factor-β signaling appears to disrupt the ability of neural crest cells to properly septate the outflow tract and establish normal cardiac architecture[2][3][19].

### Specific Cardiac Defects and Their Molecular Bases

The specific cardiac defects associated with 22q11.2DS reflect these developmental disruptions and include several distinct phenotypes[1][2][3][21][24]. Interrupted aortic arch type B, the most specific cardiovascular defect associated with 22q11.2DS, occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients with conotruncal defects and likely results from aplasia of the left fourth pharyngeal artery—a structure that would normally form the ascending aorta[2][3][21]. Tetralogy of Fallot, comprising a ventricular septal defect, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary stenosis, and right-to-left shunt, occurs in approximately 16 percent of patients with conotruncal defects and reflects defective development of the pulmonary infundibulum and improper septation of the outflow tract[2][3][21]. Truncus arteriosus, in which a single arterial trunk arises from the heart rather than separate aortic and pulmonary arteries, occurs in approximately 34 percent of patients with conotruncal defects and represents failure of the neural crest cells to properly septate the outflow[2][3][21]. Ventricular septal defects, holes in the ventricular septum allowing abnormal shunting of blood between right and left ventricles, occur frequently in 22q11.2DS[1][2][3][21]. Right aortic arch, in which the aorta arises from the right side of the heart rather than the left, occurs in approximately 20 percent of individuals with 22q11.2DS and may or may not cause significant hemodynamic compromise[2][41].

These cardiac defects directly result in pathophysiological consequences including reduced oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood, increased workload on the right ventricle leading to potential right heart failure, and in severe cases, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and lips due to insufficient oxygenation)[1][2][3]. Infants with severe conotruncal defects typically require surgical correction early in life to maintain adequate systemic circulation[1][2][3][24]. The embryological events leading to these defects occur during approximately weeks 4 to 8 of human gestation, representing a critical window of vulnerability to disruption by 22q11.2 deletion[2][3].

## Immunological Pathophysiology: Thymic Hypoplasia and Altered T-Cell Development

### Thymic Developmental Defects and Mesenchymal Cell Dysfunction

Thymic hypoplasia or aplasia represents one of the most characteristic and clinically significant features of 22q11.2DS, occurring in 60 to 70 percent of affected individuals[2][9]. The thymus gland, located beneath the breastbone in the anterior chest, serves as the primary lymphoid organ in which T lymphocytes undergo development, selection, and maturation—processes essential for adaptive immune function[2][9][12]. The thymic anlage and inferior parathyroid glands both develop within the third pharyngeal pouch during weeks 7 to 8 of human gestation, derived from complex interactions between pharyngeal endoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme[3][9][12]. The developmental defects in thymic tissue begin at this early stage of thymic organogenesis and reflect primarily defective development of the thymic stromal cell population rather than defects in T-cell lymphopoiesis per se[2][9][12].

Recent single-cell RNA sequencing of both murine and human thymuses from 22q11.2DS patients has revealed that the thymic hypoplasia reflects altered development of thymic mesenchymal cells, with disrupted biological pathways involving extracellular matrix assembly and structure, collagen production, fibril organization, and vascular development[9][39]. Specifically, TBX1 is not expressed directly in the thymic epithelial cells or thymocytes but rather in the mesenchymal cells surrounding the third pharyngeal pouch[2][12]. Reduced TBX1 function impairs development of neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells that normally support thymic stromal cell specification and organization[2][9][12]. This demonstrates again the non-cell-autonomous mechanism by which 22q11.2 deletion disrupts development—mesenchymal defects indirectly compromise thymic epithelial cell development and ultimately the proper environment for T-cell maturation[2][9][12]. The reduced thymic size directly limits the output of newly developed T lymphocytes (thymic export), leading to peripheral T-cell lymphopenia—a reduction in circulating T-cell numbers below normal age-matched levels[2][9].

Complete DiGeorge syndrome, characterized by complete absence of thymic tissue and profound T-cell lymphopenia requiring thymic transplantation, affects fewer than 1 percent of individuals with 22q11.2DS[2][9][12]. The vast majority of patients exhibit partial DiGeorge syndrome with variable degrees of thymic hypoplasia and T-cell lymphopenia, which often improves with age through a process termed spontaneous immune reconstitution[2][9]. In these patients, residual thymic tissue, although reduced in size, remains capable of generating T lymphocytes, and the peripheral T-cell pool can expand through homeostatic proliferation of existing T cells, gradually restoring immune competence over years to decades[2][9].

### Altered T-Cell Homeostasis and Functional Consequences

The reduced thymic output in 22q11.2DS leads to remarkable adaptive changes in peripheral T-cell populations that have important consequences for immune function and disease susceptibility[2][9]. Thymic hypoplasia leads to homeostatic proliferation of existing T cells as the immune system attempts to maintain peripheral T-cell numbers required for immune protection[2][9]. This compensatory mechanism results in several characteristic alterations to T-cell populations including a restricted T-cell receptor repertoire, altered CD4:CD8 ratios with relative increases in CD8+ T cells, skewing toward a Th2-dominant immune phenotype, and reduced numbers of naive T cells combined with increased proportions of memory T cells[2][9][20]. The altered T-cell homeostasis contributes to both increased susceptibility to infections and paradoxically elevated risk of autoimmune disorders—a striking feature of 22q11.2DS that initially seems contradictory but reflects fundamental defects in central tolerance mechanisms[2][9][20].

The central tolerance process, which occurs in the thymic medulla, involves presentation of self-antigens to developing thymocytes by specialized thymic epithelial cells and dendritic cells, resulting in deletion of autoreactive T cells (negative selection)[2][12]. The defective thymic selection processes in 22q11.2DS, resulting from reduced medullary tissue volume and impaired thymic epithelial cell function, allow autoreactive T cells to escape into the peripheral circulation[2][20]. Additionally, reduced thymic epithelial cell output of regulatory T cells—immunosuppressive T cells that maintain peripheral tolerance—may contribute to the increased autoimmunity[2][9][20]. The result is an immune system characterized by impaired protection against infections due to low T-cell numbers and altered T-cell function, combined with increased risk of autoimmune manifestations including autoimmune thyroiditis (occurring in 10-15 percent of patients), immune cytopenias, autoimmune enteropathy, hepatitis, and nephrotic syndrome[2][9].

### B-Cell and Mast Cell Dysfunction

Beyond T-cell abnormalities, 22q11.2DS affects multiple other immune cell populations[2][9][39]. B lymphocytes, which produce antibodies as part of humoral immune responses, show altered development and function in 22q11.2DS[2][9]. Recent RNA sequencing studies of peripheral blood B cells from 22q11.2DS patients reveal altered gene expression patterns likely resulting from epigenetic changes in genes both within and outside the 22q11.2 region[39]. Haploinsufficiency of miR-185, a microRNA encoded within the deleted region, leads to increased Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) expression in B cells, resulting in elevated autoantibody production[2][12][39]. Mast cells, tissue-resident immune cells involved in allergic and inflammatory responses, also display altered transcriptional programs in 22q11.2DS[39]. Broader systemic changes including increased vascular permeability and a disrupted blood-brain barrier further compromise immune function and contribute to the elevated risk of allergic and neuroinflammatory complications observed in these patients[2][39][44].

## Endocrine Pathophysiology: Parathyroid and Thyroid Dysfunction

### Parathyroid Gland Hypoplasia and Hypocalcemia

Hypocalcemia—a reduction in serum calcium levels—represents one of the most characteristic and potentially life-threatening complications of 22q11.2DS, reflecting profound dysfunction of the parathyroid glands[1][2][20][23]. The four parathyroid glands, small endocrine organs located behind the thyroid in the neck, regulate serum calcium and phosphorus levels through secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a hormone that acts to increase serum calcium by promoting renal calcium reabsorption, enhancing renal production of active vitamin D, and stimulating osteoclastic bone resorption[2][20][23]. In 22q11.2DS, the parathyroid glands develop from the third pharyngeal pouch in association with thymic tissue, derived from interactions between pharyngeal endoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme[3][20][23]. TBX1 haploinsufficiency impairs this developmental process, frequently resulting in hypoplastic parathyroid glands that are smaller than normal and produce insufficient PTH[2][3][20][23].

Hypocalcemia in 22q11.2DS typically becomes manifest in the neonatal period or early infancy, though the severity and timing of presentation vary significantly among affected individuals[1][2][20]. The primary mechanism involves hypoparathyroidism—deficient parathyroid hormone production and secretion—leading to inadequate renal calcium reabsorption and impaired vitamin D metabolism[2][20][23]. However, recent clinical studies have revealed that hypoparathyroidism in 22q11.2DS is not absolute but rather represents impaired PTH reserve and relative parathyroid insufficiency, with variable and often inadequate PTH responses to hypocalcemic stimuli[20][23]. Additionally, hypothyroidism—reduced thyroid hormone production—appears to contribute to hypocalcemia in 22q11.2DS, likely through effects on vitamin D metabolism and renal handling of calcium[20][23]. Hypomagnesemia—deficiency of serum magnesium—also frequently accompanies hypocalcemia in these patients and may further suppress PTH secretion and cause end-organ PTH resistance, creating a synergistic effect that deepens hypocalcemia[20][23].

The clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia reflect the critical role of calcium in neuromuscular function and include tetany (involuntary muscle contractions), paresthesias (abnormal tingling sensations), carpopedal spasm (tightening of hands and feet), and seizures—particularly in infants[1][2][20]. Severe or prolonged hypocalcemia can be life-threatening due to cardiac arrhythmias resulting from altered cardiac electrophysiology[2][20]. The lifetime prevalence of hypocalcemia in adults with 22q11.2DS is high, with studies documenting that most patients experience at least one episode of documented hypocalcemia during their lifetime[20][23]. Management typically involves calcium supplementation and active vitamin D therapy, though some patients eventually achieve normalization of calcium levels, presumably due to compensatory improvement in parathyroid hormone production over time[1][2][20].

### Thyroid Autoimmunity and Neoplastic Risk

Beyond the parathyroid dysfunction, patients with 22q11.2DS exhibit significantly elevated rates of thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid malignancy compared to the general population[32][35]. Autoimmune thyroid disease occurs in approximately 21.9 percent of 22q11.2DS patients before age 18, with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune hypothyroidism) representing the majority of cases followed by Graves' disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism)[32]. The increased risk of thyroid autoimmunity in 22q11.2DS reflects the broader pattern of autoimmune disease susceptibility in this population resulting from impaired central tolerance and altered T-regulatory cell function[2][32]. Defective thymic selection allowing autoreactive T cells specific for thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin autoantigens to escape into the peripheral circulation, combined with reduced numbers of regulatory T cells, creates a permissive environment for development of autoimmune thyroiditis[2][9][32].

Additionally, 22q11.2DS patients carrying deletions that include the SMARCB1 gene face increased risk of malignant rhabdoid tumors[6][14], and emerging evidence suggests elevated risk of thyroid neoplasms in the context of TBX1 haploinsufficiency and thyroid autoimmunity[32]. The mechanistic link between thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid cancer development likely involves chronic inflammatory signaling, altered expression of developmental regulators affecting thyroid cell fate, and potentially increased cell proliferation and transformation in response to sustained tissue inflammation[32]. Close surveillance of thyroid status through periodic ultrasonography and measurement of thyroid function and autoantibodies is therefore recommended for 22q11.2DS patients[32].

## Neuropsychiatric Pathophysiology: Brain Development and Psychiatric Disease Risk

### Cortical Development and Neurogenesis Disruption

Beyond the cardiac and immunological manifestations that initially brought attention to DiGeorge syndrome, accumulating evidence reveals that 22q11.2DS profoundly affects brain development and function, establishing a markedly elevated risk for psychiatric illness including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression[2][3][5][10][11][25][27]. The pathophysiological basis of these neuropsychiatric manifestations reflects disruptions of multiple developmental processes in the brain including neurogenesis, neural migration, synaptogenesis, and subsequent circuit maturation[2][3][5][10]. Diminished dosage of the genes deleted in 22q11.2DS specifically compromises neurogenesis and subsequent differentiation in the cerebral cortex[10][49]. Studies of mouse models have demonstrated that the deletion disrupts proliferation of basal progenitors—a population of intermediate neural progenitor cells that give rise to cortical projection neurons—with relative sparing of apical progenitors[10][49]. This selective disruption of basal progenitor proliferation results in altered frequency and laminar distribution of cortical neurons, particularly affecting layer 2/3 projection neurons that are critical for intra-cortical and cortico-cortical connectivity[10][49].

The gene RANBP1, which encodes a Ran GTPase-binding protein implicated in nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking, has emerged as a specific contributor to the neurogenetic defects in 22q11.2DS[57][60]. RANBP1 is highly expressed in the developing forebrain ventricular and subventricular zones where neural stem cells and progenitor cells reside[57][60]. Complete loss of RANBP1 function results in cortical microcephaly and marked disruption of cortical progenitor proliferation, with specific effects on M phase of the cell cycle in both radial and basal progenitors[57][60]. These findings establish RANBP1 as a microcephaly gene within the deleted region, explaining in part the reduced cortical gray matter volume and altered cortical organization observed in 22q11.2DS patients[10][49][57][60]. The disrupted neurogenesis affects layer 2/3 projection neurons preferentially, and since these neurons are critical for the cortico-cortical connections underlying complex cognitive functions, this selective disruption may establish specific vulnerability to disorders of higher cognition including schizophrenia[10][49][57][60].

### Altered Migration of GABAergic Interneurons

In addition to disruptions affecting glutamatergic projection neuron production, 22q11.2DS disrupts the migration and proper laminar placement of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, which are generated in the medial ganglionic eminence and migrate tangentially into the developing cortex[10][49]. Studies of mouse models demonstrate that the frequency of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons—the most abundant cortical interneuron subtype—is relatively preserved, but their laminar distribution is profoundly altered[10][49]. Interneurons that normally populate layer 5/6 show altered distribution in the context of 22q11.2 deletion, reflecting either disrupted interneuron migration or compensatory changes in laminar position resulting from the altered glutamatergic neuron composition[10][49]. Disrupted interneuron placement impairs the establishment of proper inhibitory circuits, potentially causing abnormalities in cortical synchronization, circuit oscillatory dynamics, and information processing—functions critical for sensory gating and attentional filtering[10][49][52]. Defects in sensory gating have been demonstrated in 22q11.2DS using prepulse inhibition testing and auditory P50 sensory gating measurements, providing direct evidence that altered cortical circuit architecture translates to impaired neural processing[2][10][27].

### TBX1-Dependent Cortical Development and Mesoderm-Brain Interaction

Recent studies have unexpectedly revealed that proper cortical development requires mesodermal expression of TBX1 through cell non-autonomous mechanisms[10]. In this mechanism, loss of TBX1 from mesodermal tissues disrupts mesodermal-epithelial interactions required for proper corticogenesis, promoting premature neuronal differentiation in the medial lateral embryonic cortex[10]. The result is altered polarity in both radially migrating excitatory neurons and tangentially migrating inhibitory interneurons, leading to altered lamination specifically in the somatosensory cortex[10]. These findings demonstrate that cortical development requires proper signaling from mesoderm-derived tissues and that disruption of these signals by TBX1 haploinsufficiency contributes to the cortical circuit abnormalities underlying the neuropsychiatric phenotypes of 22q11.2DS[10].

### Brain Metabolic Imbalance and Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Emerging research has identified disruptions in brain metabolism and mitochondrial function as central mechanisms underlying 22q11.2DS neuropsychiatric vulnerability[5][7][26][27]. TBX1 haploinsufficiency causes marked brain metabolic imbalance characterized by elevated levels of methylmalonic acid—a neurotoxic metabolite—and disruption of key metabolic pathways including glutamine-glutamate metabolism and fatty acid metabolism[7][26]. The metabolomic abnormalities reflect functional consequences of haploinsufficiency of multiple genes within the deleted region that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism, including PRODH, COMT, TXNRD2, MRPL40, and others[7][26][27]. At least nine genes within the deleted 22q11.2 region encode proteins involved in mitochondrial function, either residing within mitochondria or acting as regulators of mitochondrial processes[7][26].

PRODH (proline dehydrogenase), which encodes the first rate-limiting enzyme in proline degradation, exemplifies how disruption of metabolic genes contributes to neuropsychiatric pathology[26][27][29]. Proline degradation generates electrons that can be utilized in the electron transport chain to produce ATP, while the intermediate product pyrroline-5-carboxylate can be converted into glutamate[26][27][29]. PRODH haploinsufficiency therefore potentially reduces energy production while simultaneously reducing glutamate synthesis, creating a metabolic state of reduced neuronal energy availability and altered glutamatergic neurotransmission[26][27][29]. Hyperprolinemia (elevated blood proline) occurring in some 22q11.2DS patients further impairs cellular systems including energy metabolism and antioxidant defense, contributing to neuronal metabolic stress[26][27][29]. PRODH-deficient states also enhance accumulation of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex through epistatic interaction with COMT, a finding particularly relevant to understanding dopaminergic dysregulation in psychiatric manifestations of 22q11.2DS[26][29].

Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation appears fundamentally disrupted in 22q11.2DS, with studies of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells demonstrating significantly reduced ATP levels in neurons derived from 22q11.2DS carriers[26]. The metabolic shift toward glycolysis over oxidative metabolism creates energy insufficiency that particularly affects parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons, which have exceptionally high metabolic demands to maintain rapid and repetitive action potential firing[26]. These interneurons are particularly vulnerable to metabolic insufficiency and elevated reactive oxygen species, and their dysfunction through metabolic insufficiency directly impairs cortical inhibitory circuit function and may underlie sensorimotor gating deficits and increased psychosis risk[26]. Recent studies have identified that antioxidant treatment with N-acetylcysteine can restore deficits in connectivity and mitochondrial morphology in mouse models of 22q11.2DS, suggesting that oxidative stress represents a tractable therapeutic target[26].

### Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction and Neuroinflammation

A striking recent discovery in 22q11.2DS pathophysiology is compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, resulting from haploinsufficiency of CLDN5, which encodes claudin-5, the most densely expressed tight junction protein in brain microvasculature[44][47]. The blood-brain barrier is composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells connected by tight junctions that severely limit paracellular diffusion of ions and solutes, thus creating a barrier that maintains CNS homeostasis and protects neural tissue from circulating antigens and pathogens[44][47]. Claudin-5 is essential for this barrier function, as mice with complete CLDN5 deficiency die within 10 hours of birth from BBB disruption[47]. CLDN5 haploinsufficiency in 22q11.2DS reduces but does not eliminate claudin-5 expression, resulting in partially compromised BBB integrity[44][47].

Studies using induced blood-brain barrier cells derived from 22q11.2DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells demonstrate significantly decreased transepithelial electrical resistance—a functional measure of barrier tightness—compared to healthy control cells[44]. Moreover, post-mortem brain tissue from 22q11.2DS patients shows reduced claudin-5 expression and evidence of endothelial activation including elevated intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression[44]. The compromised barrier function combines with evidence of neuroinflammation, including elevated IL-6 expression in perivascular astrocytes, suggesting that disrupted BBB integrity permits increased extravasation of peripheral immune cells and inflammatory mediators into the CNS, establishing a state of elevated neuroinflammation[44]. This neuroinflammatory state likely contributes to altered brain development, defects in synaptic plasticity, and increased psychiatric disease vulnerability in 22q11.2DS[44].

### Dopaminergic and Catecholaminergic Dysregulation

The COMT gene, encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase, represents a critical modulator of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions[2][11][25][29][30]. COMT catalyzes the catabolism of dopamine and norepinephrine, and haploinsufficiency of COMT in 22q11.2DS leads to reduced catabolism of these catecholamines, resulting in increased dopamine and norepinephrine accumulation in the prefrontal cortex[2][11][25][29]. The effects of altered dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex are bidirectional and complex—moderate increases in dopamine enhance prefrontal cortex function and cognitive performance, while either insufficient or excessive dopamine impairs prefrontal function[2][11][25][29][30]. In the context of 22q11.2DS, the altered COMT function interacts with other metabolic disruptions, particularly elevated proline levels, to create a state of catecholamine dysregulation that potentially contributes to schizophrenia risk[2][11][25][29][30].

The interaction between COMT genotype and proline levels in determining prefrontal cortex function and psychosis risk has been directly demonstrated in 22q11.2DS[29]. Specifically, children with elevated plasma proline levels and the low-activity COMT 158 methionine (met) allele—which results in reduced dopamine catabolism—show significantly decreased smooth pursuit eye movement performance, a measure of prefrontal cortex function[29]. This finding demonstrates that elevated dopamine in the prefrontal cortex due to reduced COMT activity impairs smooth pursuit eye movement performance, an effect consistent with dopaminergic overdrive disrupting prefrontal cognition[29]. The same interaction has not been observed with other measures of sensorimotor gating or prefrontal function, but the principle demonstrates how genetic variation in COMT function combines with metabolic factors to modulate brain function and potentially psychiatric disease risk in 22q11.2DS[29].

### MicroRNA Dysregulation and Non-Coding RNA Mechanisms

The DGCR8 gene, encoding a component of the microprocessor complex essential for microRNA biogenesis, is located within the 22q11.2 deleted region[2][3][8][18][42]. Haploinsufficiency of DGCR8 impairs processing of primary microRNA transcripts into mature microRNAs, resulting in dysregulation of numerous microRNAs throughout the genome[2][3][8][18][42]. Mature microRNAs comprise 21 to 23 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of messenger RNA targets, typically leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression[2][8][18][42]. Given that microRNAs typically have multiple targets across the genome, subtle alterations in global microRNA expression can have profound effects on brain development and plasticity[2][8][18][42].

Several specific microRNAs dysregulated in 22q11.2DS have been linked to neuropsychiatric and developmental phenotypes[2][8][18][42]. MiR-185, downregulated in 22q11.2DS due to its location within the deleted region, targets multiple transcripts involved in immune cell receptor signaling and also targets sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) in hippocampal neurons[2][9][39][42]. Reduced miR-185 leads to increased presynaptic neurotransmitter release, potentially disrupting synaptic plasticity and neural circuit function[2][9][39][42]. MiR-150 is also downregulated in 22q11.2DS and targets genes involved in immune responses and neural development[2][42]. The dysregulation of miRNAs involved in critical developmental pathways—including neurological, immune system, cardiovascular, and skeletal development pathways—explains in part the remarkable pleiotropy of 22q11.2DS affecting multiple organ systems[2][8][42].

Additionally, the high density of miRNAs clustered within the 22q11.2 deleted region, combined with the presence of numerous long non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs, suggests that disruption of multiple non-coding RNA regulatory networks contributes to the variable phenotypic expression of 22q11.2DS[2][8]. The effects on expression resulting from alterations in microRNA dosage and function are likely to involve not only the central nervous system but also the cardiovascular system and other aspects of embryonic development, explaining the multi-system nature of the syndrome[2][8].

### Increased Schizophrenia Risk and Psychosis Vulnerability

The most striking psychiatric manifestation of 22q11.2DS is a markedly elevated risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders, with approximately 20 to 30 percent of 22q11.2DS carriers developing clinically significant psychosis during late adolescence or early adulthood[2][5][25][27]. The relative risk for schizophrenia in 22q11.2DS carriers is approximately 20 to 25 times the baseline population risk of 1 percent[2][5][25][27]. This elevation makes 22q11.2DS the strongest known genetic risk factor for schizophrenia and provides a window into the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying psychotic illness[2][5][25][27]. Recent biomarker studies have identified unique molecular signatures distinguishing 22q11.2DS patients at highest risk for developing psychosis[28]. Specifically, reduced plasma taurine—the most abundant free amino acid in the brain and a neuromodulator affecting synaptic function—and altered arachidonic acid levels have been identified as potential biomarkers for psychosis risk in 22q11.2DS patients[28]. These metabolomic biomarkers reflect disruptions in neuronal energy metabolism and lipid signaling pathways critical for neural development and synaptic plasticity[28].

The cumulative evidence suggests that 22q11.2DS-associated psychosis results from convergent disruptions of multiple developmental pathways and neurobiological systems—including altered neurogenesis and cortical circuit development, metabolic insufficiency of inhibitory neurons, blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation, and dopaminergic dysregulation—occurring during critical developmental windows and cumulatively establishing vulnerability for psychotic illness[2][5][6][27]. No single gene or single molecular mechanism fully accounts for the elevated schizophrenia risk, but rather multiple haploinsufficient genes acting in concert on common cellular mechanisms create a permissive neurobiological context in which superimposed environmental stressors or other genetic risk factors may precipitate clinical psychosis[2][5][27].

## Multi-System Manifestations and Organ-Specific Pathophysiology

### Skeletal and Craniofacial Pathophysiology

The skeletal abnormalities observed in 22q11.2DS reflect disrupted development of bone and cartilage derived from neural crest cells and mesoderm[1][2][3][38]. Craniofacial dysmorphic features occur in approximately 70 percent of patients, though their severity and specific manifestations vary widely[1][2][3][41]. The characteristic facial features include an elongated face, wide-set eyes with almond-shaped palpebral fissures, a bulbous nasal tip with narrow nasal passages, micrognathia or retrognathia (underdeveloped or recessed lower jaw), malar flattening representing reduced cheekbone prominence, low-set or posteriorly rotated ears with abnormal helix formation, a short philtrum, and a thin upper lip[1][2][41]. These features result from altered neural crest cell development and impaired mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during the critical period of embryonic weeks 6 through 12, when facial structures are actively forming[2][3][38].

The cleft palate observed in approximately 69 percent of 22q11.2DS patients represents another manifestation of disrupted craniofacial development[31]. The palate forms through fusion of the palatal shelves originating from maxillary processes of the first pharyngeal arch, a process requiring complex epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and proper expansion and reorientation of palatal mesenchyme[2][3][38]. TBX1 expression in mesoderm is critical for this process, and TBX1 haploinsufficiency disrupts palatal development through multiple mechanisms including altered mesenchymal cell proliferation and impaired epithelial-mesenchymal interactions[2][3][38]. Beyond overt cleft palate, many 22q11.2DS patients display submucous cleft palate—a deficiency in the musculature supporting the soft palate without a visible gap—leading to velopharyngeal insufficiency with hypernasal speech and swallowing difficulties[1][2][31].

Skeletal abnormalities also extend to long bones and vertebrae, with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) occurring in some patients, potentially related to dysregulation of microRNAs involved in vertebral development[42]. Other skeletal features may include short stature, observed in approximately 35 percent of patients, and various minor skeletal abnormalities of the hands and feet[1][6].

### Genitourinary Tract Anomalies

Structural abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract occur in 30 to 40 percent of 22q11.2DS patients[43][46]. The most common abnormalities include hydronephrosis (fluid accumulation in the kidney), unilateral renal agenesis (absence of one kidney), multicystic dysplastic kidney (abnormal kidney development with multiple cysts), and vesicoureteral reflux (abnormal backflow of urine from bladder to ureters)[1][2][43][46]. These genitourinary anomalies reflect disrupted development of the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme during embryogenesis[2][43][46]. Recent studies have identified CRKL, a gene within the 22q11.2 deleted region, as a major genetic driver of kidney defects in 22q11.2DS as well as in the general population[43]. CRKL haploinsufficiency specifically predisposes to renal and urinary tract malformations through mechanisms involving altered signal transduction in developing kidney tissue[2][43][46].

In males with 22q11.2DS, additional genitourinary abnormalities may include cryptorchidism (undescended testes), occurring in approximately 6 percent of affected males, and hypospadias (abnormal urethral opening), occurring in approximately 8 percent of affected males[46]. These abnormalities suggest disruption of endocrine signaling and neural crest cell migration during genital development[2][46]. Notably, approximately 15 percent of 22q11.2DS patients demonstrate renal or structural urinary tract anomalies, and screening renal and bladder ultrasound is recommended at diagnosis to identify these abnormalities early and allow for appropriate surveillance and management[2][43][46].

### Auditory and Otologic Manifestations

Hearing loss represents one of the most common complications of 22q11.2DS, occurring in 40 to 64.5 percent of affected individuals—a prevalence considerably higher than in the general population[55]. The hearing loss in 22q11.2DS is most frequently conductive in nature, resulting from chronic otitis media (middle ear infection) and effusion (fluid accumulation in the middle ear)[55]. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections, resulting from thymic hypoplasia and T-cell immunodeficiency, drive the recurrent otitis media[2][55]. Additionally, dysfunction of the Eustachian tube—the structure responsible for ventilating and draining the middle ear—appears to be an important contributing factor[55]. Mouse models of 22q11.2DS have demonstrated hypoplasia of the levator veli palatini muscle, an intrinsic muscle of the Eustachian tube, suggesting structural abnormalities of this organ[55].

Sensorineural hearing loss, affecting the cochlear hair cells and neural structures responsible for transducing sound into neural signals, also occurs in 22q11.2DS, though less frequently than conductive hearing loss[55]. Proposed mechanisms for sensorineural hearing loss include cochlear damage secondary to chronic otitis media, as well as possible congenital malformations of the cochlea resulting from disrupted inner ear development[55]. TBX1, essential for multiple aspects of pharyngeal development, is also required for inner ear development, suggesting that direct developmental effects on the cochlea may contribute to sensorineural hearing loss in some patients[55]. The combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss in some patients creates mixed hearing loss requiring careful audiologic assessment and management[55].

### Ocular Manifestations

Multiple ocular abnormalities have been documented in 22q11.2DS patients[45][48]. Retinal vascular tortuosity—abnormal coiling and twisting of blood vessels in the retina—occurs in 32 to 78 percent of patients[45]. Posterior embryotoxon, a prominent Schwalbe ring representing an anterior chamber developmental variant, occurs in 22 to 50 percent of patients[45]. Eye lid hooding (ptosis), attributed to reduced levator palpebrae superioris muscle development, occurs in 20 to 67 percent of patients[45]. Strabismus (eye misalignment), occurring in 12 to 36 percent of patients, may reflect both structural abnormalities and possible neural control defects[45]. Refractive errors including myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism are common and frequently require corrective lenses[48].

These ocular findings collectively reflect disruptions in neural crest cell-derived development of orbital and ocular structures, as well as possible abnormalities in the vascular development of the eye[45]. While many of these findings are clinically apparent or asymptomatic, they serve as useful diagnostic signs and warrant ophthalmologic evaluation and long-term monitoring in 22q11.2DS patients[45].

## Clinical Phenotypic Variability and Molecular Bases of Heterogeneity

### Factors Contributing to Phenotypic Heterogeneity

Despite the genetic uniformity of the core chromosomal deletion, 22q11.2DS exhibits remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity—some patients experience severe, life-threatening cardiac defects requiring early surgical intervention, while others present with primarily psychiatric manifestations or subtle developmental delays[2][3][4]. This phenotypic heterogeneity cannot be fully explained by differences in deletion size or breakpoints, as patients with identical deletion boundaries may display markedly different clinical presentations[2][3][25]. Multiple molecular and genetic factors likely contribute to this phenotypic variability[2][3][4].

First, the expression levels of genes within the deleted region are not uniformly reduced by exactly 50 percent, but rather show tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific variation in their dosage sensitivity[2][11]. Different tissues exhibit differential sensitivity to gene dosage reduction for the same gene, suggesting that tissue-specific factors modulate the functional consequences of haploinsufficiency[2][11]. Second, stochastic variation in timing of developmental events and tissue interactions during the critical windows when deleted genes exert their functions may lead to probabilistic rather than deterministic effects on development[2][3]. Third, genetic background—differences in allelic variants at other chromosomal loci—may modify the phenotypic consequences of 22q11.2 deletion[2][3][4]. Fourth, epigenetic regulation and chromatin structure may vary between individuals and during development, affecting the expression not only of genes within the deleted region but also of genes outside this region that are subject to long-range epigenetic regulation by the LCR elements[39]. Fifth, post-deletion environmental factors including infections, nutritional status, stress exposure, and access to medical care during critical developmental periods may modulate disease severity and manifestations[2][3].

### Gene Dosage-Sensitivity and Multi-Gene Interaction Models

Current evidence suggests that 22q11.2DS pathogenesis reflects complex multi-gene effects rather than haploinsufficiency of a single gene, despite the important role of TBX1[2][3][4][11][14]. The diminished expression of multiple genes—potentially most or all genes within the minimal critical deleted region—acting on common cellular mechanisms appears to be the essential contributor to the phenotypes observed[2][3][11]. Different subsets of genes appear to comprise distinct functional modules affecting particular developmental pathways or temporal windows of development[2][3][11]. For instance, several genes involved in cell cycle regulation are maximally expressed during mid-to-late gestation coincident with peak neurogenesis and cell migration, suggesting that these genes may comprise a functional module disrupting neurogenic developmental processes[2][3][11]. By contrast, several genes encoding mitochondrial proteins reach maximal expression during early postnatal life coincident with peak synaptogenesis, suggesting a role in post-natal circuit development[2][3][11]. Dosage changes at distinct developmental times in different tissues may lead to cumulative morphogenetic, neurogenic, and connectivity changes that establish forebrain circuits with increased vulnerability for psychiatric and developmental disorders[2][3][11].

### Interaction with Additional Genetic Variants

Recent studies have begun to identify how genetic variants in other loci modulate the 22q11.2DS phenotype[2][25]. The COMT 158 Val/Met functional polymorphism, which alters the efficiency of dopamine catabolism in the prefrontal cortex, has been examined as a potential modifier of schizophrenia risk in 22q11.2DS[2][25]. However, studies have failed to consistently demonstrate that COMT genotype serves as a major predictor of schizophrenia expression in 22q11.2DS, though the Met allele (low-activity variant) combined with elevated proline levels does appear to predispose to specific cognitive deficits[2][25][29]. This suggests that while COMT genotype may contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity, it is not the major determinant of psychiatric disease risk in 22q11.2DS[2][25].

Polymorphisms in CLDN5 (claudin-5), particularly variants in the 3' untranslated region of this gene, have been associated with schizophrenia risk in 22q11.2DS patients and with reduced claudin-5 in circulation and post-mortem brain tissue of schizophrenia patients generally[44][47]. This suggests that genetic variation affecting CLDN5 expression and blood-brain barrier integrity may modify neuropsychiatric disease risk in this population[44][47]. The identification of such genetic modifiers is an active area of research with potential implications for predicting disease risk and developing targeted interventions[2][25].

## Molecular Diagnostics and Disease Monitoring

### Chromosomal Microarray Analysis and Genetic Diagnosis

The gold standard for diagnosing 22q11.2DS is chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), also termed array comparative genomic hybridization, which detects the microdeletion through quantitative measurement of copy number at the 22q11.2 locus[1][2][5]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes specifically targeting genes within the deleted region (most commonly TUPLE1 or other genes in the typically deleted region) can also confirm the diagnosis[2][5]. Karyotyping, the traditional method of detecting chromosomal abnormalities, typically fails to detect the relatively small 1.5 to 3.0 megabase deletion characteristic of 22q11.2DS because the resolution of karyotyping is limited to detecting deletions larger than approximately 5 to 10 megabases[2][5]. Prenatal diagnosis is possible through amniocentesis combined with chromosomal microarray analysis, though not all prenatal ultrasound abnormalities characteristic of 22q11.2DS are detected prenatally, and some fetuses with the deletion may have normal prenatal ultrasounds[6].

### Newborn Screening and Early Detection

Some programs have implemented newborn screening for 22q11.2DS through detection of reduced T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in dried blood spots obtained from newborn screening programs[2][9]. TRECs are byproducts of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and serve as markers of thymic function—reduced TREC levels indicate low thymic output and impaired T-cell development[2][9]. This screening approach identifies the majority of complete DiGeorge syndrome cases (athymia) requiring thymic transplantation, though many partial DiGeorge syndrome cases with milder thymic hypoplasia and adequate TREC levels are not flagged by this screening approach[2][9]. Approximately 60 to 70 percent of 22q11.2DS patients have low but sufficient naive T cells with TREC levels not flagged by newborn screening[9]. Despite this limitation, newborn screening for reduced TRECs has proven valuable in identifying infants with severe thymic hypoplasia requiring immediate immunological intervention and surveillance[2][9].

### Multi-System Clinical Evaluation

Because 22q11.2DS affects multiple organ systems, comprehensive clinical evaluation by specialists in various fields is recommended[1][2][5]. Cardiac evaluation including echocardiography to detect structural defects, electrocardiography to assess electrical function, and in some cases cardiac MRI or CT is essential for detecting the cardiac manifestations[1][2][5]. Immunological assessment including measurement of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells), measurement of immunoglobulin levels, and assessment of lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens helps characterize immune function[1][2][5]. Endocrine evaluation including measurement of serum calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium with assessment of parathyroid hormone response to hypocalcemia, as well as thyroid function testing and assessment of thyroid autoantibodies, is crucial for managing endocrine complications[1][2][5][20][23]. Developmental and psychiatric screening, including formal cognitive testing and behavioral assessment, helps identify cognitive delays and psychiatric symptoms requiring intervention[1][2][5][27]. Audiological assessment including formal audiometry and otoscopic examination detects hearing loss and middle ear abnormalities[55]. Renal and bladder ultrasound screens for genitourinary tract anomalies[43][46]. Ophthalmologic examination documents ocular findings[45].

## Conclusion: Integrative Pathophysiological Model

22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome represents a complex genetic disorder arising from haploinsufficiency of multiple genes within a specific chromosomal region, with disease pathophysiology fundamentally reflecting disrupted development of tissues derived from the pharyngeal apparatus and neural crest lineage[1][2][3]. The core mechanisms involve impaired signaling during critical embryonic developmental windows, particularly weeks 7 to 12 of human gestation, when the structures most severely affected by 22q11.2DS are actively forming[2][3]. The primary candidate gene TBX1 exerts its effects through non-autonomous mechanisms, impacting the development of mesenchymal tissues that normally provide supportive signals for neural crest cell migration and differentiation, proper epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and tissue morphogenesis[2][3][8].

The pathophysiology extends well beyond the developmental period, however, as the deleted genes continue to be expressed in adolescent and adult tissues, contributing to psychiatric disease vulnerability, immune dysregulation, and metabolic dysfunction manifesting later in life[2][3][5][11]. The elevated schizophrenia risk in 22q11.2DS results from cumulative developmental disruptions—including altered neurogenesis and cortical circuit architecture, metabolic insufficiency affecting inhibitory interneurons, blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation, and altered dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling—that establish a neurobiological phenotype predisposing to psychotic illness when combined with environmental stressors or additional genetic risk factors[2][5][6][27].

The remarkable phenotypic variability characteristic of 22q11.2DS, even among patients with identical deletion boundaries, likely reflects stochastic variation in developmental processes, tissue-specific differential sensitivity to gene dosage reduction, genetic background effects modulating the expression of deleted genes and their interaction partners, and epigenetic regulation through the complex LCR architecture of the region[2][3][4][39]. The multi-system nature of the disorder, with cardiac, immunological, endocrine, skeletal, auditory, ocular, and neuropsychiatric manifestations, reflects the widespread developmental functions of the deleted genes and their expression in multiple tissues during diverse developmental processes[1][2][3][5].

Future research aimed at understanding the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms through which haploinsufficiency of specific deleted genes contributes to particular phenotypic features, identifying biomarkers predicting disease severity and psychiatric risk, and developing targeted interventions addressing the underlying molecular pathology promises to improve outcomes for this complex and multifaceted genetic disorder[2][5][6][27][28]. The identification of metabolomic biomarkers including reduced taurine and altered arachidonic acid as markers of psychosis risk in 22q11.2DS opens the possibility of early intervention and preventive strategies in this high-risk population[28]. The recognition that antioxidant treatment with N-acetylcysteine can restore deficits in connectivity and mitochondrial morphology in mouse models suggests that targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress may represent tractable therapeutic approaches[26]. As our understanding of 22q11.2DS pathophysiology deepens through continued integration of molecular, cellular, developmental, and systems-level research, opportunities for precision medicine approaches tailored to individual patients' specific molecular and clinical profiles will likely emerge.
