# Comprehensive Pathophysiology of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Molecular Mechanisms, Cellular Dysfunction, and Multi-System Complications

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) represents a complex and heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders affecting approximately one in five thousand individuals worldwide, though this prevalence may be an underestimate given recent diagnostic advances[1]. The pathophysiology of EDS involves fundamental disruptions in extracellular matrix (ECM) biology, with the 2017 nosology recognizing 13 distinct subtypes caused by pathogenic variants in 19 different genes that primarily affect collagen synthesis, processing, and organization, as well as the structural integrity and function of associated ECM components[1][4]. Beyond the well-characterized structural defects in collagen, emerging evidence reveals that EDS pathophysiology encompasses complex dysregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, autophagy, immune function, nociceptive pain pathways, and vascular integrity, making this a multifaceted disease that affects virtually every organ system. This comprehensive review synthesizes current molecular and cellular understanding of EDS pathophysiology, integrating recent discoveries in transcriptomics, proteomics, and systems-level analysis to illuminate how genetic mutations in connective tissue components cascade into the diverse clinical manifestations characteristic of this disorder.

## Fundamental Genetic Architecture and Classification of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

The genetic basis of EDS reflects the central importance of the extracellular matrix in tissue integrity and homeostasis. The 2017 classification system organizes EDS subtypes into functional groups based on the underlying molecular defect, with Group A disorders affecting the primary structure and processing of collagen, Group B disorders affecting collagen folding and crosslinking, and Group C disorders involving intracellular processes and other ECM-related disturbances[1][4]. The most prevalent subtypes include classical EDS (cEDS), vascular EDS (vEDS), and hypermobile EDS (hEDS), which together account for the majority of diagnosed cases, though rare subtypes such as kyphoscoliotic EDS (kEDS), periodontal EDS (pEDS), spondylodysplastic EDS (spEDS), and dermatosparaxis EDS (dEDS) display distinct genetic etiologies and pathophysiological mechanisms. Classical EDS is typically caused by heterozygous mutations in COL5A1 or COL5A2, encoding the proα1(V) and proα2(V) chains of type V collagen, respectively, with an estimated worldwide prevalence of one in twenty thousand[3]. Vascular EDS, the most life-threatening subtype, results from heterozygous mutations predominantly in COL3A1 encoding type III collagen, and less commonly in COL1A1[3][13]. In contrast, hypermobile EDS, the most common variant, currently lacks identified causal genes in the majority of cases, suggesting genetic heterogeneity or oligogenic inheritance patterns that remain to be fully elucidated[1]. The recent discovery that kyphoscoliotic EDS can result from pathogenic variants in FKBP14, encoding a molecular chaperone for collagen folding, exemplifies how continued molecular investigation reveals new mechanistic insights into connective tissue biology[15]. This genetic diversity underscores the complexity of connective tissue assembly and maintenance, with different gene products contributing to various aspects of ECM formation, processing, stability, and homeostasis.

## Core Pathophysiological Mechanisms: Collagen Synthesis, Processing, and Extracellular Matrix Organization

The fundamental pathophysiology of EDS originates from defective production, processing, or structural integrity of collagen molecules, the most abundant protein in the human body and a primary structural component of the ECM across virtually all tissues. In classical EDS caused by COL5A1 or COL5A2 mutations, the primary defect involves reduced availability of type V collagen, a quantitatively minor but structurally critical component that nucleates the assembly and organization of type I collagen fibrils[1][6]. Studies of dermal fibroblasts from cEDS patients demonstrate that the majority of affected individuals harbor COL5A1 haploinsufficiency due to mRNA transcript instability, with approximately 29.5 percent of cEDS cases characterized by decreased expression of one COL5A1 allele[6]. The mutations underlying COL5A1 haploinsufficiency include nonsense mutations, splice site mutations, and insertion-deletions that destabilize transcripts through mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in production of collagen V at insufficient levels to properly direct type I collagen fibrillogenesis[6]. In vascular EDS, mutations in COL3A1 typically involve glycine substitutions within the triple helical domain that disrupt the characteristic Gly-X-Y amino acid repeat pattern essential for triple helix formation and stability[2][7]. These glycine substitutions in the collagen III triple helix result in misfolded procollagen III molecules that misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum, impairing their secretion and deposition into the ECM, thereby reducing the availability of functionally mature type III collagen[2]. The defective collagen molecules that are produced often exhibit abnormal assembly into fibrils with irregular diameters, disorganized architecture, and compromised mechanical properties, features documented through transmission electron microscopy analysis of affected tissues[1][7].

Beyond the primary collagen defects, the pathophysiology of EDS involves complex dysregulation of the entire extracellular matrix ecosystem. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of skin fibroblasts from vEDS patients reveal widespread dysregulation of extracellular matrix components characterized by upregulation of multiple collagen types and other ECM proteins, suggesting compensation mechanisms that paradoxically recapitulate features reminiscent of fibrosis[7][10]. In vEDS fibroblasts, the expression and activity of lysyl oxidase (LOX), the cupro-enzyme that initiates covalent crosslinking of collagen and elastin molecules through lysine oxidation, is elevated compared to controls, and correspondingly, levels of the crosslinked form of collagen III (C-telopeptide of collagen III or CTXIII) are significantly increased[10]. This dysregulated ECM turnover in vEDS creates a pathological microenvironment where excessive collagen crosslinking contributes to increased tissue rigidity and a fibrotic phenotype that paradoxically coexists with vascular fragility and tissue weakness. The balance between extracellular effects, such as reduced protein secretion and accumulation of misfolded proteins, and intracellular consequences including ER stress, apoptosis activation, and autophagy perturbation determines the overall molecular pathology and disease severity across different EDS subtypes[2].

## Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Protein Quality Control Mechanisms

A critical component of EDS pathophysiology involves dysregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and protein quality control mechanisms, reflecting the enormous biosynthetic burden placed on the ER by collagen production. The ER is a fundamental cellular organelle responsible for synthesis, folding, modification, and transport of proteins destined for secretion, functions that are particularly demanding in fibroblasts which synthesize large amounts of collagen[11]. The biosynthesis, processing, and integrity of collagens and other ECM structural constituents are essential for maintaining intracellular proteostasis, a state of cellular protein balance that requires constant surveillance and correction of misfolded proteins[2][11]. Under normal conditions, the ER maintains homeostasis through multiple quality control mechanisms including the unfolded protein response (UPR), endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), and selective autophagy pathways that together ensure that only properly folded proteins are exported and that potentially harmful misfolded proteins are eliminated[8][11]. In cEDS and vEDS fibroblasts, however, the aberrant production and accumulation of misfolded collagen V and collagen III molecules overwhelms these quality control mechanisms, leading to perturbation of ER homeostasis that manifests as ER stress and activation of UPR signaling[2].

The unfolded protein response, a sophisticated multi-pronged cellular stress response, is activated when misfolded or unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen beyond the capacity of ER chaperone proteins to manage[8][11]. Three major ER-resident sensor proteins—protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)—detect ER stress through binding of accumulated unfolded proteins, and their activation triggers a cascade of signaling events aimed at restoring ER homeostasis[8][11]. The initial response involves PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, which attenuates global protein translation to reduce the protein synthesis burden on the stressed ER, thereby preventing further accumulation of misfolded proteins[8][11]. However, selective translation of ATF4 and the downstream induction of CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) can lead to prolonged ER stress-induced apoptosis if homeostasis is not rapidly restored[8]. In cEDS fibroblasts, transcriptomic profiling reveals dysregulated expression of genes encoding ER chaperone proteins and components of the ERAD machinery, suggesting that in addition to direct collagen misfolding, the regulatory mechanisms that normally restore ER homeostasis are themselves dysregulated[2]. These perturbations of ER homeostasis contribute to cellular dysfunction beyond simple protein folding defects, potentially triggering inflammatory signaling cascades and altered cell survival dynamics that impact the fibroblast population's capacity to maintain ECM integrity.

## Autophagy Dysregulation and Intracellular Protein Accumulation

Complementary to ER stress responses, autophagy represents another critical cellular quality control mechanism that becomes dysregulated in EDS pathophysiology. Autophagy is a fundamental intracellular degradation pathway wherein cellular components including proteins, organelles, and lipids are sequestered within double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation, a process essential for protein homeostasis, metabolism, cell survival, and tissue remodeling[2]. In normal fibroblasts, basal levels of autophagy maintain cellular quality and clear aggregated proteins that escape ER-associated degradation mechanisms; however, in cEDS fibroblasts, this pathway becomes dysregulated as evidenced by accumulation of autophagolysosomes and altered expression of autophagy-related genes[2][15]. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of skin fibroblasts from EDS patients reveals multiple autophagolysosomes, suggesting either increased autophagy initiation coupled with impaired autophagy flux, or alternatively, excessive accumulation of autophagic vesicles due to impaired lysosomal degradation capacity[15]. This autophagy dysregulation appears intertwined with aberrant ER homeostasis, as the two pathways share regulatory mechanisms and can influence each other through processes such as ER-phagy, selective autophagy of ER regions. The crosstalk between ER stress and autophagy dysregulation likely contributes to the complex pathophysiology of EDS, potentially amplifying intracellular stress and triggering pro-inflammatory or pro-apoptotic signaling cascades that further compromise fibroblast function and ECM maintenance.

## Integrin Signaling and Cell-Matrix Interactions in Classical and Hypermobile EDS

The integrity of cell-matrix interactions mediated through integrin-based focal adhesions represents another critical level of EDS pathophysiology. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors consisting of α and β subunits that serve as the primary mediators of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, providing both mechanical anchoring and essential biochemical signaling that guides cell behavior, survival, proliferation, and differentiation[2][41]. In healthy fibroblasts, type I collagen engages with the α2β1 integrin while fibronectin binds primarily through the α5β1 integrin, these canonical cell-matrix interactions organizing focal adhesion complexes at the cell periphery that contain dozens of scaffold and signaling proteins including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), integrin-linked kinase (ILK), Src family kinases, paxillin, and vinculin[2][41]. In cEDS fibroblasts, however, comprehensive immunofluorescence studies reveal profound disorganization of the ECM along with coordinated loss of the canonical integrin receptors α2β1 and α5β1[2][41]. This loss of canonical integrin organization is accompanied by a striking compensatory increase in expression and organization of the alternative integrin receptor αvβ3, which localizes to linear patches at both focal and fibrillar adhesions[2][41]. The αvβ3 integrin, while capable of binding to fibronectin and other ECM ligands containing the RGD amino acid motif, triggers a distinct and aberrant signaling cascade through recruitment of different downstream effector proteins including ILK and the transcription factors Snail1/Slug[2][41].

The functional consequences of this integrin switch from canonical α5β1 to the alternative αvβ3 receptor extend far beyond simple mechanical attachment, as the αvβ3 integrin signaling axis drives a fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT) characterized by acquisition of contractile proteins including α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton into stress fibers, and altered gene expression patterns that promote ECM degradation and perpetuate tissue remodeling[2][21][41]. This myofibroblast-like phenotype, typically associated with wound healing and tissue repair contexts, becomes pathologically sustained in EDS cells through aberrant αvβ3 integrin signaling, creating a feed-forward loop wherein compromised ECM organization reduces canonical integrin signaling, promotes αvβ3 recruitment, and triggers myofibroblast differentiation that further alters ECM composition and organization[2][21]. Studies using conditioned media from hEDS fibroblasts demonstrate that patient-derived secreted factors can transfer this pathological phenotype to control fibroblasts, converting them from normal fibroblasts into ECM-disorganized myofibroblast-like cells, indicating that hEDS cells actively secrete factors promoting ECM dysarray and myofibroblast differentiation[21]. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP9, are elevated in hEDS secretions and contribute to excessive degradation of ECM proteins, establishing a detrimental feedback loop whereby dysregulated protease activity degrades remaining functional ECM, perpetuates integrin dysregulation, and sustains myofibroblast differentiation[21].

## Type-Specific Pathophysiology: Classical Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

Classical EDS (cEDS), characterized clinically by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, and generalized joint hypermobility, displays distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms centered on type V collagen deficiency and its consequences for fibril organization and wound healing[1][3][6]. The deficiency of type V collagen in cEDS results primarily from haploinsufficiency, with approximately 30 percent of cEDS patients carrying null alleles of COL5A1 that produce no functional transcript, while an additional subset harbor missense mutations creating dominant-negative effects through incorporation of abnormal chains into heterotrimeric collagen molecules[6]. Type V collagen plays a disproportionate structural role in collagen fibrillogenesis despite comprising less than 5-10 percent of total collagen mass, functioning as a nucleation template upon which type I collagen molecules assemble into organized fibrils[1][6]. In the absence of sufficient type V collagen, type I collagen fibrils fail to organize into regular arrays with uniform diameters, instead forming haphazardly arranged fibrils with variable and often enlarged diameter distributions and compromised mechanical properties[1][56]. Beyond direct effects on collagen organization, type V collagen deficiency affects multiple aspects of tissue homeostasis through impacts on wound healing and matrix remodeling. Transcriptome profiling of cEDS fibroblasts reveals dysregulated expression of numerous genes encoding matricellular proteins such as osteopontin (SPP1), periostin (POSTN), and EDIL3, which play critical roles in cell-matrix interactions, cell migration, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling during wound healing[2][38]. The marked downregulation of EDIL3, an ECM-associated protein promoting angiogenesis through integrin binding and regulating neutrophil recruitment to inflamed tissue, suggests impaired capacity for mounting appropriate angiogenic and inflammatory responses during wound repair[2][38].

The wound healing defect in cEDS reflects both the structural abnormalities in collagen fibril organization and dysregulation of the molecular programs governing coordinated wound repair. A recently developed murine model of cEDS employing conditional deletion of Col5a1 in fibroblasts demonstrates that acute loss of type V collagen is sufficient to phenocopy multiple human cEDS pathological features including delayed re-epithelialization, poor ECM organization, enhanced and prolonged inflammation, and tissue-wide dysregulation of integrin expression[56]. In these Col5a1-deficient mice, acute wounds display gross fibrillar disorganization with collagen fibrils running orthogonally to each other in haphazard arrangements rather than the parallel organization observed in wild-type wounds, consistent with observations in human cEDS tissues[56]. The wound healing defect correlates with reduced epidermal gene expression and upregulation of inflammatory gene programs, suggesting that aberrant ECM composition and organization impairs normal keratinocyte migration and amplifies inflammatory responses[56]. Importantly, this model demonstrates that wound healing defects can be partially rescued through either fibroblast transplantation delivering wild-type cells capable of producing normal collagen, or through pharmacological inhibition of integrin signaling using cilengitide, an αvβ3 integrin antagonist, indicating that mechanosensitive integrin signaling dysfunction contributes centrally to cEDS pathophysiology and that this pathway may represent a therapeutic target[56]. The enhanced and prolonged inflammation observed in cEDS wounds correlates with upregulation of integrin expression and aberrant integrin signaling, suggesting that pathological integrin-ECM interactions drive sustained inflammatory responses through altered immune cell recruitment and activation.

## Type-Specific Pathophysiology: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

Vascular EDS (vEDS), the most severe and life-threatening EDS subtype, exhibits pathophysiology fundamentally distinct from cEDS despite sharing the common theme of collagen deficiency, reflecting the specialized structural requirements of blood vessel walls. The mutations in COL3A1 characteristic of vEDS predominantly involve glycine substitutions that disrupt the fundamental triple helix structure of type III collagen, the collagen type that comprises the major structural component of blood vessel walls, particularly within the medial and adventitial layers of arteries and hollow organs[13][16]. In contrast to the quantitative deficiency of type V collagen in cEDS, vEDS involves production of structurally defective, misfolded type III collagen molecules that accumulate abnormally in cells and compromise vascular integrity through both qualitative and quantitative mechanisms[2][7]. The defective collagen III molecules accumulate intracellularly due to impaired secretion, suggesting that misfolding in the ER prevents normal export, and the type III collagen that is successfully secreted forms abnormal fibrils and ECM structures that lack the mechanical integrity necessary to withstand arterial hemodynamic stress[2][7]. This pathophysiology manifests clinically in nearly 80 percent of vEDS patients experiencing vascular complications by age 40, including arterial aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures that together account for approximately 92 percent of vEDS-related deaths[13][16]. The median lifespan of vEDS patients is approximately 48 years, reflecting the life-threatening nature of spontaneous vascular rupture that can occur without warning under normal hemodynamic conditions[49].

The vascular fragility in vEDS results from weakened structural integrity of the arterial wall consequent to deficient type III collagen. The adventitial layer of blood vessels, which normally provides structural support and mechanical strength through its collagenous and elastic fiber networks, becomes compromised in vEDS, rendering arteries susceptible to rupture under conditions that would not challenge normal vessels[13][50]. The weakened vascular wall combined with structural abnormalities leads to increased turbulent blood flow and heightened shear stress within affected vessels, particularly at anatomical sites of hemodynamic stress such as the aortic root and the distal aortic arch, where these elevated mechanical forces combine with the compromised structural integrity to promote aneurysm formation and dissection[13][16][50]. Beyond the primary vascular complications, vEDS also predisposes to rupture of hollow organs including the gastrointestinal tract, uterus, and bladder, reflecting the importance of type III collagen throughout connective tissues[13][49][51]. Gastrointestinal perforations account for a significant proportion of vEDS morbidity and mortality, with perforations most commonly involving the colon, particularly the sigmoid colon, occurring at an average age of 24 years with mortality rates reaching 12 percent[51]. These spontaneous perforations result from the fundamental tissue fragility and poor wound healing characteristic of vEDS, wherein compromised collagen structure impairs the mechanical integrity and repair capacity of hollow organ walls. Pregnancy represents a particularly high-risk period in vEDS, with increased uterine rupture risk occurring most frequently during the third trimester when hemodynamic stress on blood vessels increases markedly, creating a scenario where the combination of pregnancy-associated vascular remodeling and underlying vascular fragility from defective type III collagen creates catastrophic risk for spontaneous rupture and maternal death[3].

## Type-Specific Pathophysiology: Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Immune Dysregulation

Hypermobile EDS (hEDS), the most prevalent EDS subtype accounting for approximately 90 percent of diagnosed cases, presents distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms that differ substantially from classical and vascular subtypes, particularly regarding the apparent absence of identified pathogenic variants in known collagen genes and the emerging recognition of immune dysfunction as a central disease driver[1][12]. The molecular basis of hEDS has remained enigmatic despite intensive genetic investigation, suggesting either genetic heterogeneity with multiple distinct genes contributing to disease, oligogenic inheritance patterns requiring multiple genetic variants for disease manifestation, or incomplete penetrance of variants that are incompletely identified[1][5]. Recent proteomic analysis has revealed a remarkable and previously underappreciated role for immune dysregulation in hEDS pathophysiology, with mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of serum from hEDS patients identifying 35 differentially expressed proteins, 43 percent of which are involved in the complement cascade and 80 percent of which participate in immune, coagulation, or inflammatory pathways[9][12]. These findings challenge the traditional paradigm of hEDS as purely a primary connective tissue disorder, instead supporting a revised understanding that includes significant innate immune dysfunction as a core pathophysiological feature[9][12].

The complement system dysfunction identified in hEDS is particularly striking, with significant reductions in classical pathway components including C1QA, as well as terminal complement components C8A, C8B, and C9, and central complement component C3, all showing consistent and reproducible reductions across hEDS patients independent of age, sex, or autoimmune status[9][12]. These reductions in complement components are notable because C8 and C9 are critical for assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC), the terminal effector of complement activation responsible for direct killing of pathogenic microorganisms and removal of damaged cells, suggesting that impaired MAC formation could compromise pathogen clearance and inflammatory regulation[9][12]. Indeed, increased infection rates have been reported in hEDS patients, a finding consistent with complement deficiency and impaired innate immune function[9][12]. Beyond complement dysregulation, hEDS serum demonstrates significant alterations in circulating cytokine profiles reflecting broader immune dysregulation. Cytokine profiling reveals altered levels of multiple key immune mediators including downregulation of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a neutrophil enzyme involved in reactive oxygen species production and microbicidal activity, and Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), an innate immune recognition protein produced by activated neutrophils, suggesting alterations in neutrophil-driven immune responses and tissue remodeling[9][12]. The reduction in tissue growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), combined with dysregulation of profibrotic mediators including IGFBP-2 elevation, creates an immunological microenvironment characterized by impaired tissue repair signaling and altered inflammatory responses[9][12].

The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ECM dysregulation in hEDS overlap substantially with those identified in cEDS and vEDS despite the absence of identified collagen mutations, with hEDS fibroblasts displaying characteristic disorganization of multiple ECM components and abnormal integrin receptor organization[2][5][38][39]. Gene expression profiling of hEDS fibroblasts reveals dysregulation of genes encoding cell-matrix interaction proteins, inflammatory and pain response mediators, and evidence of fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition with acquisition of myofibroblast markers including α-SMA and altered cadherin-11 organization[2][5][38][39]. Emerging findings from microRNA (miRNA) profiling of hEDS fibroblasts provide novel insights into disease etiopathogenesis, with differential expression of multiple miRNAs that target ECM-related genes, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms involving post-transcriptional gene regulation through miRNA-mediated silencing contribute to the complex molecular pathology of hEDS[2][5][39]. Notably, hEDS cells show dysregulation of miRNAs including hsa-miR-378a-3p, hsa-miR-224-5p, and hsa-let-7f-5p that target numerous ECM-related genes and transcription factors, indicating that altered miRNA expression contributes to the characteristic ECM disarray and gene expression perturbations observed in hEDS[39].

## Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction and Dysautonomia

Beyond the well-recognized connective tissue pathology, EDS pathophysiology encompasses dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that affects a substantial proportion of EDS patients, particularly those with hEDS[26][29]. Dysautonomia, encompassing autonomic dysfunction affecting the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems that regulate involuntary bodily processes including heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, digestion, and bladder function, represents a multi-system manifestation of EDS that significantly impacts quality of life and clinical complications[26][29]. Recent comprehensive evaluation of 270 hEDS patients revealed that widespread but mild autonomic failure is present in 90 percent of hEDS patients on formal autonomic testing, with highly prevalent complaints including orthostatic sudomotor symptoms (>90% prevalence), vasomotor symptoms, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and pain in a similar proportion[26]. The mechanisms underlying autonomic dysfunction in EDS remain incompletely understood but likely involve both structural abnormalities of autonomic nerve fibers and dysregulation of autonomic signaling, with evidence suggesting roles for small fiber neuropathy, altered sympathetic outflow, and impaired cerebrovascular regulation[26][29].

Orthostatic intolerance, affecting the majority of hEDS patients, manifests as symptoms triggered by standing including lightheadedness, palpitations, tremor, weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue that reflect inadequate cardiovascular and cerebrovascular compensation for positional changes[26][29]. The pathophysiology underlying orthostatic intolerance in hEDS appears multifactorial, with approximately 33 percent of hEDS patients meeting diagnostic criteria for postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate of 30 or more beats per minute upon standing or head-up tilt in the absence of orthostatic hypotension[26][29]. Additional mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance include impaired cerebral blood flow regulation, with 79 percent of hEDS patients demonstrating reduced orthostatic cerebral blood flow velocity that correlates with orthostatic dizziness symptoms, suggesting that cerebral hypoperfusion contributes significantly to orthostatic intolerance in this population[26]. Small fiber neuropathy, detected in 82 percent of hEDS patients using combined structural and functional diagnostic criteria, represents another significant neurological manifestation that may contribute to both pain pathophysiology and autonomic dysfunction[26]. The small unmyelinated C-fiber and thinly myelinated A-delta nerve fibers that comprise the small fiber neuropathy detected in EDS patients are thought to mediate both nociceptive pain signaling and autonomic regulation of blood vessels and other target organs, suggesting that the same neural pathology contributes to both pain and autonomic symptoms[26].

## Central Sensitization and Chronic Pain Pathophysiology

Chronic widespread pain represents one of the most common and disabling manifestations of EDS, particularly in hEDS where pain often becomes the primary driver of disability and psychological distress. The pain in EDS results from complex interactions between peripheral nociceptive input, small fiber neuropathy, and dysregulation of central pain processing mechanisms including central sensitization[26][27][30]. Central sensitization, defined as an increase in the excitability of neurons within the central nervous system such that normal inputs begin to produce abnormal pain responses, represents a critical pathophysiological mechanism wherein pain itself becomes altered and amplified independent of ongoing peripheral tissue damage[27][30]. In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and brainstem pain processing regions, repeated or intense nociceptive input triggers maladaptive neuroplastic changes characterized by enhanced synaptic transmission, reduced inhibitory neurotransmission, and altered gene expression patterns that collectively amplify pain signaling[27][30]. The molecular basis of central sensitization involves dysregulation of multiple neurotransmitter systems including excessive glutamate signaling through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, enhanced expression of AMPA receptors on postsynaptic neuronal membranes, and reduced GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory neurotransmission[27][30]. Additionally, substance P, a neuropeptide co-released with glutamate from C-fiber nociceptors, activates neurokinin receptors on dorsal horn neurons and amplifies NMDA receptor-mediated pain signal amplification[27][30].

The peripheral nociceptive input that drives central sensitization in EDS originates from both small fiber neuropathy affecting unmyelinated C-fibers and thinly myelinated A-delta fibers, as well as from ongoing tissue damage and inflammatory processes in joints and connective tissues[26][27][30]. Small fiber neuropathy in EDS results from structural abnormalities of nerve fiber innervation patterns within the dermis, documented through skin biopsy showing reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density and abnormal distribution patterns[26]. The inflammatory environment in EDS tissues, characterized by dysregulated cytokine production including elevated pro-inflammatory mediators, likely contributes to both peripheral nociceptor sensitization and central amplification of pain signals[27][29]. Inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) act on peripheral nociceptors to lower pain thresholds, a process termed peripheral sensitization, while simultaneously driving central neuroinflammation through microglial activation and release of additional pro-inflammatory cytokines[27]. The dorsal horn microglia, resident macrophages that normally maintain basal surveillance functions, become activated in response to persistent nociceptive input or systemic inflammation and release pro-inflammatory mediators that enhance neuronal excitability and amplify pain processing[27]. This neuroinflammatory amplification of pain represents a feed-forward mechanism wherein inflammatory signals activate microglia, which release additional inflammatory mediators that enhance pain signal processing, thereby amplifying the pain experience beyond what the peripheral nociceptive input alone would generate[27].

Psychological and emotional factors significantly modulate central sensitization in EDS, with stress, anxiety, and traumatic life experiences capable of priming the pain system through distinct mechanisms involving altered catecholamine metabolism and enhanced nociceptor responsiveness[27][30]. Patients with central pain processing disorders including EDS often demonstrate hyperalgesic priming, wherein prior painful or stressful events result in enhanced and prolonged pain responses to subsequent stimuli through activation of distinct kinase and gene transcription pathways within nociceptors[27]. This
