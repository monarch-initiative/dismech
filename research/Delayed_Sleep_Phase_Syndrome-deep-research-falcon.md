Title: Pathophysiology of Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome / Delayed Sleep–Wake Phase Disorder (DSPS/DSWPD)

Publication date: 2026-02-27

1. Disease identifiers and definition

Disease name and nosology
Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) is now commonly termed Delayed Sleep–Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) in modern classifications. It is defined by a persistent delay of the major sleep period relative to desired or socially required times, causing difficulty falling asleep and waking at desired times, with functional impairment. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 1-2, consens2023circadianrhythmsleepwake pages 155-156)

MONDO ID
A MONDO identifier was not available in the retrieved sources and could not be verified in this run.

Key circadian concepts/definitions
• Zeitgeber: The primary environmental time cue for entrainment of the circadian clock; in humans, light is emphasized as dominant (see below). (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4)
• Circadian phase markers: Dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), core body temperature (CBT) minimum (CBTmin), and related rhythms used to infer circadian timing. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 1-2)
• Phase angle of entrainment: The phase relationship between circadian markers (e.g., DLMO/CBT rhythm) and sleep timing. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 1-2)
• Intrinsic circadian period (“tau”): Individual endogenous period length; longer tau predisposes to later entrained phase. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4, futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 2-3)

2. Core pathophysiology (molecular/cellular mechanisms)

2.1 Central mechanism: delayed circadian phase and altered entrainment
DSWPD is often conceptualized as a disorder of delayed circadian timing relative to the external light–dark cycle and social timing demands. In clinical/review literature, delayed circadian phase is typically indexed by delayed DLMO and/or CBT rhythms in a substantial subset. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4, futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 8-10)

Light–SCN entrainment and downstream melatonin rhythm
The SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) is explicitly identified as the generator of key circadian outputs: CBT and melatonin rhythms are described as “generated by the SCN” and as “well-established indicators of circadian rhythms.” (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4)
Mechanistically, light influences SCN firing and clock gene transcription: Futenma et al. describe that light stimulation at specific times can alter SCN firing and “activates molecular signaling and clock-gene transcription,” regulating melatonin rhythms. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 2-3)

Direct quotable statements supporting light-driven entrainment and variability
• “light stimulation is the most important zeitgeber” (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4)
• “individual sensitivity to light varies 50-fold on a logarithmic scale” (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4)
• DLMO definition/measurement: “DLMO, which is measured in light less than 10 lx, enables the estimation of the circadian phase of melatonin secretion.” (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4)

Intrinsic period (tau) as a mechanism predisposing to delay
Futenma et al. explicitly link longer tau to later entrained phase: “The length of tau varies among individuals, and individuals with longer tau are entrained at a later phase.” (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4)
They also provide an estimated mean intrinsic period: ~24.15 h (SD 0.2 h) and note sex differences (~6 minutes shorter in women). (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 2-3)

Altered light sensitivity and phase response
DSWPD may involve increased sensitivity to night light, which can increase phase delays. Futenma et al. report: “photosensitivity at night is higher in patients with DSWPD than in normal sleepers, which may contribute to the delay in circadian rhythm.” (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4)
Wu’s 2023 review summarizes converging evidence that DSWPD patients can be especially sensitive to the melatonin-suppressing effect of light, particularly in the pre-DLMO window, and may exhibit a reduced melatonin surge; it also discusses hypothesized alterations in the phase response curve (PRC) that could make phase advances harder to achieve. (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 4-5)

2.2 Pathophysiology beyond circadian delay: subtype heterogeneity and sleep homeostasis

Circadian-delayed vs circadian-entrained subtypes
A key recent refinement is that not all patients with clinically delayed sleep timing show delayed objective circadian markers.
Futenma et al. state that “approximately 40% … of patients with DSWPD have normal timing of melatonin secretion profile … even though their sleep–wake schedule is clearly delayed,” describing this subgroup as “circadian-entrained DSWPD.” (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 1-2)
The same review reiterates that ~40% of cases may be circadian-entrained and that behavioral/psychological factors can enlarge the phase angle between DLMO and sleep onset (instead of a delayed DLMO). (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 8-10)

Sleep homeostasis alterations
Wu (2023) emphasizes that DSWPD is commonly viewed as purely circadian, but accumulating evidence suggests sleep-homeostatic differences relative to controls. Reported patterns include slower build-up and slower dissipation of sleep pressure and altered recovery sleep dynamics in evening types/DSWPD. (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 4-5, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 5-6)
This supports a two-process pathophysiology model in which both circadian and homeostatic processes contribute to the phenotype in different individuals. (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 4-5, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 5-6)

3. Key molecular players (genes/proteins, small molecules, cell types, anatomy)

3.1 Genes and proteins (HGNC-level entities)

Core circadian clock genes implicated in sleep-wake phase disorders
A 2023 Nature Reviews Genetics synthesis reports Mendelian forms of advanced/delayed sleep-wake phase disorders and lists implicated clock genes: PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRY2, CSNK1D, and TIMELESS. Functional follow-up links variants to altered circadian period length and altered entrainment to light, with phosphorylation changes supported in model systems. (lane2023geneticsofcircadian pages 6-7)
In broader human genetic studies of circadian timing, additional loci include ARNTL (BMAL1), PER1, VIP, RGS16, PATJ, and HCRTR2 (orexin receptor 2) among others. (lane2023geneticsofcircadian pages 4-6)

CRY1 as a high-confidence mechanistic gene for delayed sleep phase phenotypes
A 2023 Journal of Clinical Investigation study provides direct mechanistic evidence for CRY1 splice variants associated with delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) in families. It describes CRY1 as a core clock repressor that “represses the activity of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 transactivation.” (onat2023humancry1variants pages 2-3)
Key variant-mechanism links include:
• CRY1Δ11 (c.1657+3A>C; rs184039278): described as gain-of-function and associated with delayed sleep phase phenotypes; the paper reports it is present at ~1% frequency in Europeans. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 1-2)
• Enrichment in a validation cohort: 8/62 patients with combined ADHD and insomnia carried CRY1Δ11 vs 0/369 controls. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 1-2)
• Period effect size: CRY1Δ11 lengthens the circadian period by ~26 minutes versus wild-type. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 5-9)
• CRY1Δ6 (c.825+1G>A): exon-6 skipping variant showing reduced BMAL1/CLOCK affinity and an arrhythmic phenotype, segregating with ADHD and DSPD in the family studied. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 1-2, onat2023humancry1variants pages 9-10)
These observations connect molecular clock repression dynamics (CRY1–CLOCK/BMAL1 complex) to human delayed sleep phase phenotypes. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 1-2, onat2023humancry1variants pages 5-9)

Expression-phase biology in peripheral cells
Wu (2023) cites evidence that inter-individual differences in habitual sleep timing map to the entrained phase of endogenous circadian rhythms of BMAL1, PER2, and PER3 mRNA in human leukocytes. (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 6-7)

3.2 Chemical entities / small molecules (ChEBI-level entities)

Endogenous melatonin (ChEBI:17195)
Melatonin phase (DLMO) is a key physiological marker and mechanistic effector of circadian timing. DLMO-based quantification is described as a practical estimate of melatonin phase. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 1-2)

Exogenous melatonin (chronobiotic)
Exogenous melatonin shifts circadian phase. Wu (2023) states that when melatonin is “taken in the early evening prior to DLMO it advances the circadian phase,” consistent with a PRC that is roughly inverse to light. (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 1-2)
Clinical trial implementation includes nightly 0.5 mg fast-dissolve melatonin for 28 days, timed relative to DLMO (measured vs estimated) to test whether biomarker-based timing produces greater phase shifts. (NCT03715465 chunk 1)

Melatonin receptor agonists (chronobiotics)
• Tasimelteon (dual MT1/MT2 agonist): a case report and related trial program describe it as a melatonin receptor agonist with high affinity for MT1 and MT2 that can entrain circadian sleep phase timing; a DSWPD clinical program includes a multicenter randomized component with an 11-month open-label extension dosing 60 minutes before desired bedtime. (smieszek2023casereporta pages 1-2)
• Ramelteon is discussed as a melatonin receptor agonist with limited evidence (case reports) in DSWPD, and randomized trials are noted as lacking in Wu’s review. (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 4-5, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 8-9)

Light (short-wavelength/blue ~480 nm as a functional “chemical-like” stimulus)
Although not a chemical entity, short-wavelength light (~480 nm) is repeatedly identified as particularly potent for melatonin suppression and circadian phase effects. Futenma et al. note circadian rhythms are most sensitive to ~480 nm blue light and that melatonin suppression is more potent at these wavelengths, which has implications for optimizing light therapy or for evening blue-light restriction. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 8-10)

3.3 Cell types (Cell Ontology-level entities)

Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs; melanopsin-positive)
ipRGCs are described as integrating rod/cone signals and driving non-visual functions including circadian entrainment and the pupillary light response. (hartstein2024differencesinthe pages 1-2)
Schöllhorn et al. (2024) note melanopsin is expressed by ipRGCs, which project to the SCN for circadian photoentrainment and to the olivary pretectal nucleus for pupil reflexes. (schollhorn2024theimpactof pages 1-2)
Disease-relevance: a cited study within a 2023 DSWPD case report explicitly states “Melanopsin-dependent phototransduction is impaired in delayed sleep-wake phase disorder,” suggesting a retinal non-visual photoreception contribution to DSWPD in at least some patients. (smieszek2023casereporta pages 5-5)

Peripheral leukocytes
Peripheral blood leukocytes are used in human studies measuring circadian-phase of BMAL1/PER2/PER3 mRNA rhythms linked to habitual sleep timing. (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 6-7)

3.4 Anatomical locations (UBERON-level entities)

Key tissues/structures
• Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN; hypothalamus): central pacemaker; source of CBT/melatonin rhythmic outputs and site of light-driven resetting. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4, futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 2-3)
• Retina (including ipRGCs): transduces light for non-image-forming circadian entrainment; melanopsin pathway implicated. (hartstein2024differencesinthe pages 1-2, schollhorn2024theimpactof pages 1-2)
• Pineal gland (implied via melatonin secretion physiology; not explicitly asserted in the extracted excerpts).

4. Dysregulated pathways and cellular processes

4.1 Canonical molecular clock transcriptional feedback
DSWPD-associated variants implicate core transcriptional repression of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex by CRY1. The JCI paper explicitly states CRY1 “represses the activity of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1.” (onat2023humancry1variants pages 2-3)
This maps to dysregulation of circadian transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFL), impacting circadian period length and phase stability. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 5-9, lane2023geneticsofcircadian pages 6-7)

4.2 Light input pathway and non-visual phototransduction
ipRGC/melanopsin-mediated phototransduction provides a mechanistic route by which evening light can suppress melatonin and delay circadian phase. ipRGCs are described as key drivers of circadian entrainment. (hartstein2024differencesinthe pages 1-2, schollhorn2024theimpactof pages 1-2)
Impaired melanopsin-dependent phototransduction has been reported in DSWPD (quoted in a DSWPD case report’s cited literature), suggesting that abnormal retinal light signaling could contribute to altered entrainment. (smieszek2023casereporta pages 5-5)

4.3 Sleep homeostasis and circadian–homeostatic interaction
Wu (2023) summarizes evidence for differences in sleep pressure dynamics in DSWPD/evening types and notes interactions between sleep history and circadian processes (including effects of sleep deprivation on clock gene expression in model systems and the possibility that sleep–wake patterns can modify SCN entrainment). (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 5-6)

5. Biological processes and cellular components (GO-oriented mapping)

5.1 Candidate disrupted GO Biological Process terms (examples for knowledge-base annotation)
• GO:0007623 circadian rhythm (core disrupted process; altered phase/period). (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4, lane2023geneticsofcircadian pages 6-7)
• GO:0007622 rhythm of circadian clock (period lengthening by CRY1Δ11; arrhythmic phenotype for CRY1Δ6). (onat2023humancry1variants pages 5-9, onat2023humancry1variants pages 9-10)
• GO:0042752 regulation of circadian rhythm (light/melatonin phase-resetting; SCN-dependent regulation). (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 2-3, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 1-2)
• GO:0009416 response to light stimulus (ipRGC/melanopsin signaling affecting melatonin and phase). (hartstein2024differencesinthe pages 1-2, schollhorn2024theimpactof pages 1-2)
• GO:0032922 circadian regulation of gene expression (leukocyte BMAL1/PER2/PER3 mRNA phases relate to sleep timing). (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 6-7)
• GO:0048511 rhythmic process (broad umbrella for coupled circadian and homeostatic changes). (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 5-6)

5.2 Candidate GO Cellular Component terms (where processes occur)
• SCN neurons: hypothalamic neuronal circuits generating circadian outputs (SCN referenced explicitly). (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4, futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 2-3)
• Nucleus (CLOCK/BMAL1 transcriptional regulation; CRY1 repression implies nuclear transcriptional complexes). (onat2023humancry1variants pages 2-3)
• Retina / retinal ganglion cell layer: site of melanopsin-mediated phototransduction (ipRGCs). (hartstein2024differencesinthe pages 1-2, schollhorn2024theimpactof pages 1-2)

6. Disease progression model (sequence from trigger to phenotype)

A mechanistic sequence consistent with recent reviews is:
1) Predisposing factors: genetic variants affecting clock period or repression strength (e.g., CRY1Δ11 lengthening period; other rare variants in PER/CRY/CSNK1D/TIMELESS), plus developmental tendency to delayed melatonin timing during adolescence and behavioral/environmental drivers (late-night light exposure, social schedules). (onat2023humancry1variants pages 5-9, lane2023geneticsofcircadian pages 6-7, feder2024justletme pages 7-9)
2) Entrainment imbalance: longer tau and/or altered PRC makes phase advances less likely; increased evening/night light sensitivity and evening screen exposure suppress melatonin and push phase later. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 4-5)
3) Circadian misalignment: delayed DLMO/CBT rhythm relative to desired bed/wake time; or, in circadian-entrained DSWPD, normal DLMO but an enlarged phase angle due to behavior/psychological factors. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 1-2, futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 8-10)
4) Clinical syndrome: sleep-onset insomnia at conventional bedtime, difficulty awakening at required times, daytime impairment (fatigue, impaired concentration), social/academic/work dysfunction; relapse risk after treatment is commonly described. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 1-2, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 1-2)

7. Phenotypic manifestations and ontology mapping

7.1 Core clinical phenotypes (Human Phenotype Ontology; examples)
• Delayed sleep phase / delayed sleep onset (concept supported by definition and mechanistic delay). (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 1-2, consens2023circadianrhythmsleepwake pages 155-156)
• Sleep-onset insomnia (explicitly noted as common in DSWPD). (consens2023circadianrhythmsleepwake pages 150-152)
• Difficulty waking / delayed wake time (by definition and treatment targets). (consens2023circadianrhythmsleepwake pages 155-156)
• Daytime sleepiness / impaired daytime function (noted in DSWPD context and treatment goals). (smieszek2023casereporta pages 1-2)

7.2 Psychiatric/neurodevelopmental comorbidity
DSWPD is frequently comorbid with psychiatric disorders; CRY1-related families show strong co-segregation with ADHD and DSPD, and phenome-wide associations link CRY1Δ11 with major depressive disorder, insomnia, and anxiety. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 2-3, onat2023humancry1variants pages 9-10)

8. Recent developments (2023–2024 focus)

8.1 Subtyping: “circadian-delayed” versus “circadian-entrained” DSWPD
A major 2023 synthesis emphasizes that ~40% of patients may have normal melatonin timing despite delayed sleep schedules, reframing DSWPD as heterogeneous rather than uniformly “delayed DLMO.” (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 1-2, futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 8-10)

8.2 Precision genetics: CRY1 splice variants and clinical translation
The 2023 JCI study provides a strong mechanistic bridge from genotype → altered CLOCK/BMAL1 repression and altered period/arrhythmicity → delayed sleep phase phenotype. It also provides population frequency estimates for CRY1Δ11 (~1% frequency in Europeans) and suggests it may serve as a diagnostic marker in relevant subgroups. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 1-2, onat2023humancry1variants pages 5-9)

8.3 Retinal non-visual photoreception as a mechanistic focus
2024 work continues to refine measurement and mechanistic interpretation of melanopsin/ipRGC signaling in humans, including silent-substitution approaches and melanopic irradiance metrics linked to melatonin suppression and pupil dynamics. These methods strengthen mechanistic inference about the light input pathway relevant to phase-delaying evening light. (schollhorn2024theimpactof pages 1-2)
The statement that “Melanopsin-dependent phototransduction is impaired in delayed sleep-wake phase disorder” highlights an actionable mechanistic hypothesis for a subset of DSWPD patients (retinal/circadian input phenotype). (smieszek2023casereporta pages 5-5)

9. Current applications and real-world implementations

9.1 Light-based circadian phase advance (clinical protocols)
Light therapy is described as first-line in some clinical guidance. Futenma et al. report protocols of 2,500–10,000 lux for 30 minutes to 2 hours, timed to the morning (after CBTmin) or 1–3 hours before spontaneous awakening to phase-advance. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 8-10)
Consens (2023) gives implementable advice: dim light for 2 hours before bedtime to facilitate endogenous melatonin release and ~60 minutes of bright light after waking to advance phase; a 30-minute bright-light maintenance regimen is suggested after stabilization. (consens2023circadianrhythmsleepwake pages 150-152, consens2023circadianrhythmsleepwake pages 155-156)

9.2 Melatonin timed to circadian phase (DLMO-guided treatment)
A key translational application is biomarker-guided melatonin timing. The University of Michigan trial NCT03715465 tests nightly 0.5 mg melatonin timed 3 hours before measured DLMO vs 3 hours before estimated DLMO, with DLMO shift as a primary endpoint. (NCT03715465 chunk 1)
Wu (2023) emphasizes that dosing time relative to DLMO is more critical than dose variation for phase shifting. (wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 1-2)

9.3 Tasimelteon development in DSWPD
• NCT04652882 (Vanda; Phase 3): randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating daily tasimelteon for 28 days with sleep-onset change by diary as primary endpoint. (NCT04652882 chunk 1)
• NCT06701396 (Vanda; Phase 3, 2024 start): a precision-medicine trial restricted to DSWPD patients carrying CRY1Δ11, using a double-blind crossover single-dose design with polysomnography-derived latency to persistent sleep as primary outcome. (NCT06701396 chunk 1)
A 2023 Frontiers in Neuroscience case report describes tasimelteon as a high-affinity MT1/MT2 agonist that acts by entraining circadian sleep phase timing and reports symptom resolution in an adult DSWPD patient (with optic nerve hypoplasia) with confirmed delayed DLMO. (smieszek2023casereporta pages 1-2)

10. Relevant statistics and quantitative data (recent sources)

Prevalence
• DSWPD prevalence is estimated at approximately ~3%. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 1-2, lane2023geneticsofcircadian pages 6-7)

Subtype proportion
• Approximately ~40% of clinically diagnosed DSWPD may have normal melatonin timing (“circadian-entrained DSWPD”). (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 1-2, futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 8-10)

Quantitative physiology
• Light sensitivity variability: “individual sensitivity to light varies 50-fold on a logarithmic scale.” (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4)
• Intrinsic period: mean tau ~24.15 h (SD 0.2 h), with women ~6 minutes shorter than men. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 2-3)

Quantitative genetics
• CRY1Δ11 frequency: described as ~1% in Europeans. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 1-2)
• CRY1Δ11 functional period effect: lengthens circadian period by ~26 minutes. (onat2023humancry1variants pages 5-9)

11. Expert interpretation and analysis (synthesis across sources)

Current best-supported mechanistic model
Recent reviews converge on a multi-factorial pathophysiology in which delayed phase arises from an interplay of (i) intrinsic circadian properties (tau, PRC characteristics), (ii) environmental light exposure patterns (especially evening/night light with high melanopic content), (iii) genetic variants in core clock genes that change period length or entrainment properties (e.g., CRY1 splice variants), and (iv) in a substantial subset, non-circadian contributors including altered sleep homeostasis and behavioral/psychological patterns that widen the phase angle without delayed DLMO. (futenma2023delayedsleep–wakephase pages 3-4, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 4-5, lane2023geneticsofcircadian pages 6-7, wu2023updatesandconfounding pages 5-6)

Clinical implications
The heterogeneity (circadian-delayed vs circadian-entrained) supports personalized treatment selection: circadian-delayed cases are plausibly most responsive to PRC-informed circadian phase shifting (morning bright light, evening dim light, correctly timed melatonin/MT1–MT2 agonists), whereas circadian-entrained cases may require greater emphasis on behavioral/cognitive interventions and sleep scheduling to address maladaptive phase angle and insomnia-maintaining factors.
