# Pathophysiology of Prurigo Nodularis (PN)

**Disease Name:** Prurigo Nodularis  
**MONDO ID:** MONDO:0026045  
**Category:** Complex (multifactorial chronic inflammatory skin disease)

## 1. Core Pathophysiological Mechanisms  
Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic *neuroimmune* dermatosis characterized by severe itch (pruritus) and multiple hyperkeratotic nodules on the skin. Its pathophysiology involves a self-perpetuating **“itch–scratch cycle”** driven by interactions between the immune system, the nervous system, and the skin barrier ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=due%20to%20chronic%20scratching,innovative%20therapeutic%20approaches%2C%20which%20are)). Lesional PN skin exhibits dense **dermal inflammatory infiltrates** (primarily T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells) that release pruritogenic mediators, alongside **hyperplastic sensory nerve fibers** that release neuropeptides – together these amplify itch and inflammation in a vicious cycle ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=system,are%20explored%20in%20this%20review)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=role%20in%20PN,helper%202%20cell)). In essence, **chronic Th2-driven inflammation** in the skin triggers intense itching, and repeated scratching induces further immune activation, nerve fiber proliferation, and cutaneous damage. Over time, this cycle leads to **epidermal hyperplasia** and **dermal fibrosis**, manifesting as the characteristic pruritic nodules of PN ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=role%20in%20PN,helper%202%20cell)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37506977/#:~:text=Results%3A%20This%20study%20demonstrates%20that,and%20keratinocyte%20responses%20toward%20normal)).

**Immune Dysregulation:** PN is fundamentally an inflammatory skin disorder with a skewed **Type 2 (Th2) immune response**. Lesional biopsies show **marked infiltration of Th2-polarized CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells**, **eosinophils**, and **mast cells** in the dermis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=The%20pathology%20reveals%20concentrated%20infiltrations,afflicted)). These cells release a milieu of *itch-inducing* and pro-inflammatory mediators – including **interleukin-31 (IL-31)**, **IL-4**, **IL-13**, **IL-5**, *histamine*, *prostaglandins*, *tryptase*, and eosinophil granule proteins – which together provoke intense pruritus and cutaneous inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=The%20pathology%20reveals%20concentrated%20infiltrations,afflicted)). In PN lesions, **eosinophils** degranulate and release **eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)**, **eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN, also called EPX)**, and **major basic protein (MBP)**, which can damage local tissues and nerves ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=PN%20%28Figure%201%20%29,39%2C35%20%2C%2042)).  ECP and EDN in particular have **neurotoxic effects** and are found at significantly elevated levels in PN skin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=skin,34%20%2C%2040%2C37)), suggesting that eosinophils actively contribute to nerve injury and abnormal nerve regeneration in the disease.

**Neuroimmune Connection:** A defining feature of PN pathophysiology is the aberrant crosstalk between the immune system and the peripheral nervous system in the skin. PN lesions demonstrate **dermal neuronal hyperplasia**, meaning an increased density of cutaneous nerve fibers (notably unmyelinated C-fibers responsible for itch sensation) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=documented%20the%20presence%20of%20neuronal,35%5D.%20One%20study)). Immunostaining of PN skin shows upregulation of pan-neuronal markers (like PGP9.5) and nerve growth factor receptors on these sprouted nerve endings ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=documented%20the%20presence%20of%20neuronal,35%5D.%20One%20study)). The excess nerve fibers actively release **neuropeptides** such as **substance P (SP)** and **calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)** into the skin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=pathophysiology%20of%20PN%20%28Figure%201%29,affected%20skin)). SP is a well-known pruritogenic neurotransmitter that binds **neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1R)** on neurons and also **MRGPRX2 receptors** on mast cells, causing mast cell degranulation and further release of histamine and proteases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=pathophysiology%20of%20PN%20%28Figure%201%29,affected%20skin)). CGRP, likewise elevated in PN lesions, can induce **neurogenic inflammation** by acting on mast cells and eosinophils, and it may disrupt local opioid signaling (e.g. altering β-endorphin and mu-opioid receptor expression) that normally helps modulate itch ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=neuropeptide%2C%20CGRP%2C%20with%20a%20mechanism,MOR)). In this way, **activated sensory nerves amplify inflammation**: the neuropeptides they release recruit and activate immune cells, which in turn secrete more cytokines and pruritogens, creating an **amplification loop** of itch and inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=match%20at%20L326%20,as%20histamine%2C%20tryptase%2C%20proteases%2C%20and)). This neuroimmune feedback loop is central to PN’s persistence.

Notably, **type 2 cytokines** released by Th2 cells (chiefly **IL-4** and **IL-13**) serve as a bridge between the immune and nervous systems in PN. These cytokines profoundly alter the cutaneous neuroimmune environment: IL-4/IL-13 signaling via JAK-STAT6 is active in PN lesions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Patients%20with%20PN%20undergoing%20IL,In%20the%20context)), and their receptors are expressed not only on immune cells and keratinocytes but also on **fibroblasts** and **peripheral neurons** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Patients%20with%20PN%20undergoing%20IL,In%20the%20context)). IL-4 and IL-13 **“disrupt the neuroimmune network of the skin”**, leading to intensified itch ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=with%20these%20receptors%20being%20prominently,stimulate%20fibroblast%20proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20and)). One mechanism is by **upregulating itch receptors** – IL-4/IL-13 increase the expression of the **IL-31 receptor (IL-31RA)** and other pruriceptive receptors on sensory neurons, thereby *“heightening the sensitization of histamine-independent sensory neurons to pruritogens”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=with%20these%20receptors%20being%20prominently,stimulate%20fibroblast%20proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20and)). In parallel, IL-4/IL-13 promote tissue remodeling: they **stimulate dermal fibroblasts** to proliferate, migrate, and produce **pro-fibrotic factors** (like **transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)**, collagens, **periostin**, and other extracellular matrix proteins) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=immune%20cells%2C%20but%20also%20in,This%20process%20contributes%20to%20exaggerated)). This drives **exaggerated fibrosis and dermal thickening** in lesions. Indeed, the **nodular fibrosis** seen in PN skin can be traced to chronic type 2 inflammation combined with mechanical injury from scratching (analogous to a wound-healing response gone awry). 

In summary, the core pathophysiology of PN is a **neuroimmune dysregulation** in the skin: Th2-skewed inflammation (with **hyperactivated immune cells** and **type 2 cytokines**) converges with **neuronal hyper-excitability** (excessive itch nerve fiber activation and neuropeptide release). The result is **severe chronic pruritus** and self-inflicted skin injury that perpetuate each other ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=system,are%20explored%20in%20this%20review)). This distinguishes PN as both an inflammatory **and** a neuro-sensory disorder.

## 2. Key Molecular Players and Cells Involved  
**Immune Cells & Cytokines:** The **cellular players** in PN lesions include a variety of immune cells: **T helper 2 (Th2) cells** (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IL-4/IL-13), **mast cells** (tissue-resident granulocytes loaded with histamine and tryptase), **eosinophils** (IL-5–responsive granulocytes contributing to allergic inflammation), and also **macrophages and dendritic cells** to a lesser extent ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=system,are%20explored%20in%20this%20review)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=immune%20cells%20in%20the%20skin%2C,These%20inflammatory)).  These cells congregate in the **papillary dermis** of PN lesions (just below the epidermis) forming an inflammatory infiltrate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=The%20pathology%20reveals%20concentrated%20infiltrations,afflicted)). Key **cytokines** and mediators produced by these cells include: 

- **Interleukin-31 (IL-31)** – a central “itch cytokine” in PN. IL-31 is produced mainly by activated Th2 cells (and some **type 2 innate lymphoid cells**) and acts on a broad range of cells. Its receptor, **IL-31RA** (paired with OSMRβ, the oncostatin M receptor subunit), is expressed on **sensory neurons**, **keratinocytes**, **mast cells**, **eosinophils**, **basophils**, and monocytes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=IL,89%5D.%20Also%2C%20epidermal)). IL-31 binding to its receptor on cutaneous **nerve fibers** directly triggers intense itch signaling. It also can stimulate keratinocytes and immune cells, promoting further inflammation. Notably, IL-31 links the immune and nervous systems: *“IL-31 plays a pivotal role in the neuroimmune connection between type 2 inflammation and sensory neurons.”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=IL,89%5D.%20Also%2C%20epidermal)) In PN patients, IL-31 levels are elevated in lesional skin and serum, correlating with itch severity (IL-31 is often highly upregulated in PN compared to other pruritic conditions ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1301817/full#:~:text=PN%20exhibit%20coexistent%20atopic%20dermatitis,exhibit%20limited%20efficacy%20against%20PN))). **Clinical relevance:** Targeting the IL-31 pathway (e.g., with **nemolizumab**, an anti-IL31RA antibody) has shown significant reduction in PN itch, underscoring IL-31’s key role ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37506977/#:~:text=dermis%20of%20PN%20skin,and%20keratinocyte%20responses%20toward%20normal)).

- **IL-4 and IL-13** – hallmark Th2 cytokines that orchestrate much of the immune response in PN. IL-4/IL-13 drive **IgE production** and eosinophil recruitment (via IL-5 induction) systemically, and locally in skin they cause **barrier dysfunction** and **inflammation**. In PN lesions, IL-4/IL-13 are highly expressed and activate STAT6 in keratinocytes and other cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Patients%20with%20PN%20undergoing%20IL,In%20the%20context)). These cytokines potentiate itch by increasing neuronal IL-31R and possibly other itch receptors (like **TRPV1**, **TRPA1** – see below)  ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=with%20these%20receptors%20being%20prominently,stimulate%20fibroblast%20proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20and)). They also induce **fibrogenic genes** in dermal fibroblasts (e.g. COL1A1, COL3A1 collagens, *TGFB1*, *POSTN*) leading to collagen deposition and nodule formation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=immune%20cells%2C%20but%20also%20in,This%20process%20contributes%20to%20exaggerated)). The importance of IL-4/IL-13 is highlighted by the efficacy of **dupilumab** (an IL-4Rα antagonist blocking both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling): in 2022 dupilumab became the **first FDA-approved treatment** for PN ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11099982/#:~:text=There%20is%20currently%20only%20one,variable%20efficacy%20and%20significant%20side)), significantly improving itch and skin lesions in clinical trials by dampening this type 2 inflammation.

- **IL-5** – another Th2 cytokine, primary regulator of eosinophils. IL-5 drives eosinophil differentiation, activation, and survival ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Targeting%20IL)). PN lesions often show tissue eosinophilia and elevated IL-5 or *eotaxin* levels, implicating IL-5 in recruiting/activating eosinophils in skin. Therapies targeting the IL-5 pathway (e.g., **benralizumab**, an anti-IL-5Rα monoclonal antibody) are currently in trials for PN ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=IL,Moreover%2C%20it)), aiming to reduce eosinophil-mediated inflammation.

- **Alarmins (IL-33, TSLP)** – epithelial cell–derived cytokines that can initiate type 2 immune responses. **Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)** and **IL-33** are released by keratinocytes under stress or injury (such as from chronic scratching). They can directly trigger pruritus by acting on sensory nerves: TSLP signals via **TSLP receptors** on neurons and immune cells, while IL-33 signals via **ST2 receptor**. These alarmins are implicated in atopic dermatitis and appear to play a role in PN as well ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=IL,thereby%20contributing%20to%20itching%20and)). Epidermal stress from scratching can *“trigger itching through alarmins and other pruritogenic molecules (TSLP, IL-33, kallikrein, cathepsin S) activating specific receptors on sensory neurons (TSLPR, ST2, MRGPRC11, and PAR2)”*, contributing to itch propagation in PN ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=IL,thereby%20contributing%20to%20itching%20and)).

- **Histamine and Mast Cell Mediators:** Although PN often does not respond to antihistamines, **mast cells** are abundant in lesions and upon activation release **histamine** (which acts on H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors on nerves and immune cells), **tryptase** and other proteases (which can activate **PAR-2** receptors on nerves), **prostaglandins**, **leukotrienes**, and other inflammatory mediators ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=lymphocytes%2C%20mast%20cells%2C%20and%20eosinophilic,granules%20containing%20neuropeptides%2C%20ECP%2C%20eosinophil)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=through%20the%20release%20of%20mediators,pivotal%20in%20the%20development%20of)). These contribute to vasodilation, itch, and recruitment of more immune cells. Mast cell proteases (like tryptase) can also directly activate sensory neurons via protease-activated receptors, causing *histamine-independent itch*. The high mast cell load in PN skin – sometimes forming mast cell-rich fibrotic nodules – indicates they are key effector cells in the disease. (Trials of **mast cell–depleting therapies** such as anti-KIT antibody *barzolvolimab* are being explored in PN ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=targeting%20oncostatin%20M%20receptor,was%20created%20with%20Biorender%20at)).)

- **Eosinophil Granule Proteins:** As noted, eosinophils in PN release toxic cationic proteins. **ECP (eosinophil cationic protein)** and **EDN/EPX** can injure keratinocytes and unmyelinated nerve fibers, potentially explaining the observed **epidermal nerve damage** in chronic lesions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Concurrently%2C%20dermal%20neuronal%20hyperplasia%20releases,helper%202%20cell)). **Major basic protein (PRG2)** from eosinophils can activate mast cells (a vicious cycle, since mast cell tryptase can in turn attract more eosinophils). Elevated serum IgE often found in PN patients may also lead to eosinophil activation via IgE/FcεRI pathways, linking adaptive and innate immunity in the lesions.

**Neural Elements:** The *nervous system* components in PN are primarily the **cutaneous sensory neurons** that mediate itch. These are mostly **C-fiber polymodal nociceptors** and some **Aδ fibers** in the skin (terminals of dorsal root ganglion neurons that innervate the dermis and epidermis) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9604302/#:~:text=The%20skin%20is%20densely%20distributed,67%20%2C%2075)). In PN, these nerve fibers show both **structural and functional changes**: 

- **Nerve Fiber Hyperplasia:** Skin biopsies from PN show an increase in intraepidermal nerve fiber density (**IENF**) and sprouting of **dermal nerves** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=match%20at%20L268%20documented%20the,35%5D.%20One%20study)). Normally, the epidermis has a sparse network of peptidergic fibers; in PN, chronic inflammation and nerve growth factors (like **nerve growth factor, NGF**) lead to **axon elongation and branching**, resulting in “neural hyperplasia.” One study documented **abundant PGP9.5<sup>+</sup> nerve fibers in PN dermis** along with upregulation of NGF and its receptors (TrkA/**NTRK1** and p75<sup>NTR</sup>) in lesional skin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=documented%20the%20presence%20of%20neuronal,35%5D.%20One%20study)). **NGF**, produced by keratinocytes and mast cells in the skin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9604302/#:~:text=3)), is a critical mediator: it promotes survival and sprouting of sensory neurons. PN lesions have **increased NGF and receptor (TrkA, p75) expression**, and IL-4/IL-13 can further **enhance NGF receptor expression (TrkA)** on keratinocytes and neurons, creating a positive feedback for nerve growth ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9604302/#:~:text=peripheral%20nervous%20system%20in%20the,11)). The proximity of NGF-expressing cells to nerve fibers and to mast cells in PN skin has been noted, highlighting a *local NGF-driven neuro-immune interaction* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9604302/#:~:text=lesions%20,TrkA%20can%20further%20enhance%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9604302/#:~:text=CNPG%20,Furthermore%2C%20NGF%20can)).

- **Neuropeptides:** **Substance P (encoded by the TAC1 gene)** and **CGRP (CALCA gene product)** are significantly **upregulated in PN lesions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=pathophysiology%20of%20PN%20%28Figure%201%29,affected%20skin))**. Substance P (SP) is released from nerve endings in response to itch or irritation and binds to **NK1 receptors** on neurons and skin cells. In PN, there is an **increased density of SP<sup>+</sup> nerve fibers** in the dermis and higher SP levels than in non-lesional skin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=pathophysiology%20of%20PN%20%28Figure%201%29,affected%20skin)). SP’s actions include direct activation of mast cells via MRGPRX2, causing degranulation and histamine release ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=pathophysiology%20of%20PN%20%28Figure%201%29,affected%20skin)), and stimulation of keratinocytes and immune cells to produce more cytokines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=match%20at%20L326%20,as%20histamine%2C%20tryptase%2C%20proteases%2C%20and)). CGRP, another neuropeptide often co-released with SP from C-fibers, is also elevated; it acts as a potent vasodilator and can drive **neurogenic inflammation** by recruiting immune cells (e.g. causing mast cells and eosinophils to release inflammatory mediators) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=neuropeptide%2C%20CGRP%2C%20with%20a%20mechanism,MOR)). CGRP can also interfere with local opioid signaling: evidence suggests it reduces expression of **μ-opioid receptors** on keratinocytes or immune cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=neuropeptide%2C%20CGRP%2C%20with%20a%20mechanism,MOR)), which might diminish the skin’s natural itch-inhibitory pathways. Other neuropeptides such as **vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)** and **gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)** may also be involved in pruritus, but SP and CGRP are the most documented in PN. Together, these neuropeptides reinforce inflammation (a process known as *neurogenic inflammation*) and heighten the sensation of itch.

- **Itch Receptors and Ion Channels:** Sensory nerve fibers in PN express various receptors and channels that detect itch stimuli. Apart from **histamine H1/H4 receptors** and **NK1R**, there are G-protein coupled receptors like **MRGPR family** (e.g., MRGPRX1 on neurons for non-histaminergic itch in humans, analogous to MrgprC11 in mice) and **protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2)** on sensory nerves. Chronic pruritogens in PN (such as tryptase, cathepsins, and eosinophil proteases) can activate these receptors, leading to itch transmission ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=IL,thereby%20contributing%20to%20itching%20and)). Additionally, **Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels** are key transducers of itch signals on sensory neurons. **TRPV1** (the capsaicin receptor) and **TRPA1** are both expressed on cutaneous C-fibers; they can be activated by heat, histamine, endothelin, and various pruritic mediators. Upregulation or heightened activity of TRPV1/TRPA1 has been noted in chronic itch conditions and likely in PN as well ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Transient%20receptor%20potential%20,respond%20to%20diverse%20physical%20and)). These channels mediate Calcium influx in neurons, leading to action potentials that the central nervous system interprets as itch. Chronic inflammation (via cytokines like NGF, IL-31, IL-4) can lower the threshold of TRP channels, making nerves hyper-responsive (**peripheral sensitization**). 

**Keratinocytes and Skin Barrier:** Though PN is primarily neuroimmune, **keratinocytes** (the epidermal skin cells) also play an active role. The epidermis in PN lesions shows **acanthosis** (thickening of the spinous layer) and **hyperkeratosis** (thick stratum corneum with scale/crust), indicating **keratinocyte hyperproliferation** driven by chronic injury and cytokines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=role%20in%20PN,helper%202%20cell)). Keratinocytes can produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) and chemokines that attract immune cells. They are also a major source of **NGF** in the skin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9604302/#:~:text=3)), as well as **TSLP** and **IL-33** under stress. In PN, due to repetitive scratching, the skin barrier is disrupted and keratinocytes are in a constant state of wound-healing and regeneration. This **altered epidermal state** may amplify immune activation (via release of alarmins) and facilitate penetration of environmental irritants or microbes, further aggravating inflammation. Additionally, keratinocyte-derived **endothelin-1** and **kallikreins** can directly activate itch fibers or mast cells, adding to pruritus. In summary, keratinocytes in PN contribute both to **inflammation** (by cytokine release) and **neural sensitization** (by producing NGF and other neurotrophic factors) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=role%20in%20PN,helper%202%20cell)).

**Fibroblasts and Stromal Components:** Recent research highlights the role of **dermal fibroblasts** in PN’s nodular lesion formation. Chronic scratching and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13) cause fibroblasts in the dermis to adopt a **pro-fibrotic, myofibroblast-like phenotype**, depositing excessive collagen and extracellular matrix. A 2024 single-cell RNA sequencing study (Ma et al., JACI 2024) identified a subset of **COL11A1<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts** that is expanded in PN lesions. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37506977/#:~:text=Results%3A%20This%20study%20demonstrates%20that,and%20keratinocyte%20responses%20toward%20normal)) These fibroblasts highly express collagens and fibrosis-related genes and are predominantly located in the **papillary dermis** of the nodules ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37506977/#:~:text=Results%3A%20This%20study%20demonstrates%20that,and%20keratinocyte%20responses%20toward%20normal)). This fibrotic response appears to be a key discriminator between PN and atopic dermatitis: *“Activation of fibrotic responses is the main distinguishing feature between PN and atopic dermatitis skin.”* ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37506977/#:~:text=responses,and%20keratinocyte%20responses%20toward%20normal)) The same study showed that treating PN patients with **nemolizumab** (IL-31RA blockade) not only improved itch but **drove the COL11A1<sup>+</sup> fibroblast and keratinocyte gene expression profiles back toward normal skin** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37506977/#:~:text=responses,and%20keratinocyte%20responses%20toward%20normal)). This suggests that IL-31 and the itch-scratch cycle sustain an ongoing wound-healing fibrotic program in PN; interrupting itch can allow the skin to begin reversing the pathological fibrosis. Fibroblasts also produce **periostin** (a matricellular protein induced by IL-13) which is elevated in PN lesions and contributes to fibrosis and itch (periostin can activate sensory nerves and mast cells). **TGF-β** released by macrophages and T-cells in lesions further drives fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. 

**Anatomical Locations:** PN can affect any skin region, but lesions are classically distributed on **extensor surfaces of limbs** (arms and legs) and the **trunk**, areas within hand’s reach that patients can scratch ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1301817/full#:~:text=recalcitrant%20chronic%20pruritus%20and%20keratotic,half%20of%20the%20patients%20with)). Lesions are often symmetrically present. The mid-back is usually spared (the “butterfly sign”) because it’s difficult to reach and scratch ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1301817/full#:~:text=discrete%20nodules%20are%20often%20symmetrically,between%20the%20pathogeneses%20of%20PN)). This distribution underscores the role of scratching behavior in lesion development. Histologically, the pathology is located in the **skin (UBERON:0002097)** – primarily the **epidermis (UBERON:0001003)** and **dermis (UBERON:0001025)**. The **epidermal compartment** shows changes like hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and often erosions/excoriations from scratching. The **dermal compartment** (especially superficial dermis) houses the inflammatory cell infiltrates and altered neural and fibrous tissue architecture. Demyelination or injury to **epidermal nerve fibers** (the terminals of peripheral neurons in the epidermis) is also observed due to repeated mechanical trauma ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Concurrently%2C%20dermal%20neuronal%20hyperplasia%20releases,helper%202%20cell)). Deeper structures (subcutis) are generally not heavily involved except for extension of fibrosis in long-standing lesions. PN is an entirely cutaneous disorder; however, the **peripheral nervous system** (specifically, cutaneous branches of sensory nerves) and **immune organs** (e.g., lymph nodes where T-cells may be primed) are indirectly part of its pathology due to the systemic nature of chronic inflammation.

## 3. Disrupted Biological Processes (GO Terms)  
Prurigo nodularis involves disruption of multiple biological processes, many of which correspond to gene ontology (GO) terms:

- **Chronic Inflammatory Response (GO:0002544)** – PN lesions are characterized by ongoing chronic inflammation, with an immunological milieu similar to a chronic wound or chronic allergic response. There is continuous recruitment of immune cells and release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

- **Type 2 Immune Response (GO:0042092)** – A dominant Th2-type immune activation is present. Processes like **eosinophil chemotaxis** and activation (GO:0050673, GO:0002283) are upregulated, driven by IL-5 and eotaxins. **Mast cell activation** (GO:0043303) and **degranulation** are ongoing processes triggered by antigen/IgE interactions and neuropeptides. **T cell activation** (GO:0042110) in PN is skewed toward Th2 differentiation (GO:0042093).

- **Cytokine-Mediated Signaling Pathway (GO:0019221)** – Signaling via interleukins (IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, etc.) is highly active. For example, **JAK-STAT signaling** downstream of IL-4/IL-13 (GO:0007259) is upregulated in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, leading to transcription of genes like *CCL26* (eotaxin-3), *SOCS1/3*, and fibrosis-related genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Patients%20with%20PN%20undergoing%20IL,In%20the%20context)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=immune%20cells%2C%20but%20also%20in,This%20process%20contributes%20to%20exaggerated)). **MAPK and NF-κB pathways** might also be activated by chronic immune receptor signaling in PN, contributing to cell proliferation and cytokine production by keratinocytes.

- **Neuropeptide Signaling (GO:0007218)** – The communication between nerve and immune cells in PN can be framed as neuropeptide signaling processes being dysregulated. Release of neuropeptides (SP, CGRP, VIP) and activation of their receptors on target cells is a continuous process rather than the tightly controlled, transient process in healthy tissue. This leads to sustained **neurogenic inflammation**.

- **Sensory Perception of Itch (related to GO:0050954 “sensory perception of pain/itch”)** – The normal process of itch sensation transmission is altered. **Pruriception** involves peripheral detection of itch stimuli and signaling to the central nervous system. In PN, pruriceptive signaling is enhanced: there is **peripheral sensitization** (lowered threshold for neuron activation due to inflammatory mediators) and **central sensitization** (amplification of itch signals in the spinal cord and brain). Clinically, PN patients often experience **alloknesis** (itch from normally non-itchy stimuli) and **hyperknesis** (exaggerated itch from mild stimuli), indicating changes in the neuronal processing of sensory input ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=match%20at%20L288%20detected%2C%20indicating,fibers%20%5B70%5D.%20Another%20sign%20of)).

- **Keratinocyte Proliferation & Differentiation (GO:0043616, GO:0030216)** – The epidermal keratinocytes in PN undergo hyperproliferation (an aspect of lesion thickening) and abnormal differentiation (leading to scale/crust formation). Scratching-induced injury triggers wound healing pathways in keratinocytes, including **epidermal cell migration** (GO:0035313) to cover excoriations and **hyperkeratosis** (related to GO:0001530, cornification). Upregulation of growth factors like **amphiregulin** and NGF in keratinocytes contributes to epidermal hyperplasia.

- **Extracellular Matrix Organization (GO:0030198)** – A hallmark of PN nodules is excessive extracellular matrix deposition. **Fibroblast activation** leads to increased synthesis of collagens (COL1A1, COL3A1, COL11A1), fibronectin, and glycosaminoglycans. Normally, tissue repair is tightly regulated (GO:0042060 wound healing); in PN, this process is persistently active and dysregulated, leading to **fibrosis** (scarring). Enzymes that remodel the matrix, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), are likely imbalanced as well.

- **Peripheral Nervous System Development/Regeneration (GO:0048666)** – The observed nerve fiber sprouting suggests that pathways for **axonogenesis and neurotrophin signaling** are aberrantly active. NGF/TrkA signaling (GO:0048011, neurotrophin TRK receptor signaling pathway) is upregulated, driving nerve growth into the epidermis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9604302/#:~:text=3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9604302/#:~:text=peripheral%20nervous%20system%20in%20the,11)). In healthy skin, nerve density is maintained by a balance of growth and pruning; in PN, chronic NGF and other factors tilt the balance toward growth and sensitization.

- **Behavioral Response to Itch** – Although not a classical GO term, the **compulsive scratching behavior** is a crucial process in PN pathophysiology. Repetitive mechanical trauma from scratching leads to **neuroinflammation** and **tissue damage** (akin to GO:0014823 “response to mechanical stimulus” and GO:0006958 “complement activation in injury” if considering downstream effects). This behavior is reinforced by neuronal circuits (itch creates urge to scratch, scratching temporarily relieves itch but ultimately worsens it). One could consider central processes like *habit formation* and *reward pathways* being abnormally engaged (patients often report pleasure in scratching despite harm, implicating dopamine/opioid pathways in the brain).

Overall, PN perturbs normal homeostatic processes of the skin: **immune homeostasis**, **sensory homeostasis**, and **barrier maintenance** are all compromised. Instead of resolving inflammation or sensation, the system gets locked in an **itchy, inflammatory state**.

## 4. Cellular Components and Localization of Pathology  
At a cellular level, the key pathophysiological events in PN occur at specific sites:

- **Cell Surface and Receptors:** Many interactions in PN happen at the **plasma membrane** of cells. For example, **IL-31 receptors** (IL31RA/OSMR) are expressed on the cell surface of sensory neurons, keratinocytes, and immune cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=IL,89%5D.%20Also%2C%20epidermal)), where they transduce IL-31 signals across the membrane to activate JAK-STAT inside the cell. Similarly, **IL-4 receptor α (IL4R)** is on keratinocyte and fibroblast membranes, binding IL-4/IL-13 and triggering internal signaling cascades ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Patients%20with%20PN%20undergoing%20IL,In%20the%20context)). **Neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1R)** on neurons and immune cells bind substance P at the cell surface, and **Mast cell IgE receptors (FcεRI)** and MRGPRX2 are also membrane-bound, initiating mast cell activation when engaged. Thus, the **cellular membrane compartments** where receptors and channels reside are crucial components in PN (e.g., the **axon membrane** of nerve endings enriched with TRPV1, or the **mast cell membrane** with IgE/FcεRI and MRGPRX2).

- **Extracellular Space (Dermal Extracellular Matrix):** The dermis’ extracellular matrix (ECM) is not just structural but a key arena for PN’s pathological interactions. **Cytokines, neuropeptides, and mediators** are released into the extracellular space of the skin. For instance, histamine, IL-31, TSLP, and CGRP diffuse through the dermal interstitial fluid to find their receptors on target cells. The **extracellular matrix** also binds and presents some of these factors (heparan sulfate in the matrix can bind basic molecules like IL-4 or NGF, prolonging their local effect). In PN, the **papillary dermis** ECM is altered – there is **collagen deposition**, increased **fibronectin**, and possibly changes in **nerve guidance molecules**. Electron microscopy has shown deposition of abnormal **collagen fibrils** around nerve fibers in chronic pruritic lesions, indicative of fibrosis encasing nerves. Key ECM proteins like **type I and type III collagen** (gene *COL1A1*, *COL3A1*) are increased, and cells like fibroblasts and macrophages in the dermis secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9, MMP-12) that remodel the ECM. The **basement membrane zone** (dermal-epidermal junction) may also thicken in PN due to repeated trauma and repair.

- **Epidermis:** The upper layer of skin (epidermis) is a major site of PN pathology. **Keratinocyte layers** show changes: the stratum corneum (outermost layer) is often thick and compact (hyperkeratosis) with crusts from excoriation; the stratum spinosum is expanded (acanthosis); there may be focal **parakeratosis** (retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum, a sign of abnormal keratinocyte turnover). In the viable epidermis, **Langerhans cells** (epidermal dendritic cells) may be increased or activated due to constant antigen stimulation from microbes or allergens introduced by scratching, though the primary pathology is deeper. **Intraepidermal nerve fibers**, which normally extend into the lower epidermis, are noteworthy – they may be increased in number but many show signs of damage (swollen varicosities or fragmentation) because scratching shears them ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Concurrently%2C%20dermal%20neuronal%20hyperplasia%20releases,helper%202%20cell)). This combination of nerve proliferation and damage leads to altered sensation (patients often have diminished sensation to certain stimuli but heightened itch – a paradox seen in chronic itch conditions).

- **Dermis:** The dermis (especially the superficial dermis) is the **central stage** for PN’s pathological drama. Here is where the inflammatory infiltrate resides: perivascular **T cells**, clusters of **mast cells**, and interstitial **eosinophils** can be found throughout the dermis of lesions (often around the mid-dermis and papillary dermis). Blood vessels in the dermis often show **endothelial swelling** and perivascular inflammatory cells, suggesting a component of **angiogenesis and vascular remodeling** (new small vessels can form as part of chronic inflammation). The **nerve fibers** course through the dermis: in PN they exhibit branching and sometimes **myelin thinning** if larger fibers are involved. Dermal appendages like hair follicles and sweat glands can also be affected; chronic inflammation may lead to destruction of follicles or sweat glands in the nodules, contributing to lichenification. The dermis is where **fibroblasts** are actively laying down collagen in PN, so one finds thickened collagen bundles on histology. Elastin fibers might be altered (sometimes a reduction, as fibrosis can replace normal elastic fibers, contributing to the hard feel of nodules). All these events take place in the dermal compartment, making it a key “cellular component” of PN lesions.

- **Peripheral Nerve Structures:** Beyond the skin itself, PN likely involves components of the peripheral nervous system. The **dorsal root ganglia (DRG)** neurons that innervate the affected skin undergo changes in chronic itch – for example, increased expression of neuropeptides (like SP/CGRP) and ion channels (Na<sub>v>1.7, TRPV1 upregulation) in those neurons has been observed in chronic pruritus models. While the DRG and spinal cord are not part of the skin lesion per se, they are part of the anatomical pathway. In PN, **central sensitization** implies changes at the level of the spinal cord dorsal horn (where itch fibers synapse). Studies show that PN patients have exaggerated responses to pruritic stimuli, meaning spinal interneurons and second-order neurons are hyper-responsive. Thus, components like **spinal cord dorsal horn** neurons and their receptors (e.g., increased NMDA receptor activity or loss of inhibitory interneurons) might also be abnormally functioning (though these changes are inferred rather than directly measured in PN patients).

In summary, PN’s pathology localizes to the **skin’s layers (epidermis and dermis)** and the interfaces between **nerves and skin**, and **immune cells and skin**. Key cellular locales include the *surface receptors* on nerves and immune cells (where signaling initiates), the *extracellular milieu* of the dermis (where mediators act), and the *structural cells* of the skin (keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which respond to and contribute to the inflammatory environment).

## 5. Disease Progression and Sequence of Events  
Prurigo nodularis often develops through a series of stages or events:

- **Initiation/Trigger:** The condition may begin with an inciting **pruritic trigger**. Many patients have a history of an underlying itchy dermatosis (e.g., **atopic dermatitis** in about 50% of cases ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1301817/full#:~:text=risk%20of%20psychological%20disorders%20%28e,by%20stromal%20remodeling%20and%20neurovascular)), or other causes of chronic itch such as **renal pruritus, bug bites, or neuropathic itch**). At disease onset, a localized itch (from eczema, an insect bite, etc.) leads the patient to scratch that area intensely. In some patients, PN can arise **de novo** without a known preceding disease – in these cases, dry skin or minor neuropathic changes might start a cycle of itching. Regardless of cause, a key step is that **acute itch becomes chronic** (itch lasting >6 weeks, by definition) and **scratching becomes habitual**.

- **Early Lesional Phase:** Repeated scratching of one area causes the skin to thicken and form **pruritic papules**. Initially, one might see small erythematous or skin-colored bumps where the patient scratches. Histologically, these early lesions show **spongiosis** (slight epidermal edema) and acute inflammatory cells. As scratching continues, each papule undergoes **lichenification** – the skin becomes rough, thick, and exaggerated in skin markings. This is a localized chronic eczema-like process. The persistent mechanical trauma also causes **micro-tears** in the epidermis, prompting **keratinocyte proliferation** and an influx of lymphocytes and mast cells to repair the damage ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=role%20in%20PN,helper%202%20cell)). Patients often describe that no matter how much they scratch, the itch in that spot remains or spreads – indicating the transition to a self-sustaining itch cycle.

- **Established Nodule Phase:** With ongoing scratching, papules coalesce or enlarge into **nodules** (typically ~1–3 cm dome-shaped, hyperkeratotic lesions). At this stage, the lesions of PN are fully developed: the epidermis is markedly hyperplastic and often pigmented or crusted from trauma, and the dermis contains a dense chronic inflammatory infiltrate with **fibrosis**. **Fibroblasts** in the dermis get activated as if the skin injury is not healing, laying down collagen – the lesion becomes firmer. There may be distinct zones in a nodule: an active outer edge where inflammation is high, and a central area that might scar over time. **Neuronal changes** also become more pronounced in established lesions: patients might feel the nodule is extremely itchy but also sometimes numb or painful around it (nerve function is dysregulated). This corresponds to the observed **nerve fiber proliferation plus damage** in chronic lesions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=Concurrently%2C%20dermal%20neuronal%20hyperplasia%20releases,helper%202%20cell)). The established nodules can persist for months or years unless treated.

- **Generalization/Chronic Phase:** PN often generalizes – patients who start with a few nodules may, through continued scratching and auto-inoculation of itch, develop dozens of nodules over their body. Chronic PN is characterized by cycles of new lesion formation and healing of old lesions. Some nodules may resolve spontaneously if protected from scratching (they often leave behind **hyperpigmented, scarred macules**). However, new nodules tend to appear as long as the underlying trigger and itch impulse remain. At this phase, **central sensitization** is thought to set in: the spinal cord and brain become conditioned to itch, so the patient might feel itching even in absence of stimuli or scratch in their sleep reflexively. Indeed, an **expert consensus** describes chronic prurigo (including PN) as a condition where the brain’s itch modulation is altered – scratching can occur **“automatically and in the absence of itch”** in some patients (a habit loop) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10796623/#:~:text=...10.1111%2Fjdv.13827.%20,J%20Eur%20Acad%20Dermatol%20Venereol)).

- **Distinct Stages:** Clinically, some authors categorize PN lesions as **early (papular)** vs **late (nodular)**, or by an Investigator’s Global Assessment stage (IGA) based on number and thickness of nodules. Early lesions might be more inflammatory (red, with more T-cells and edema), whereas late lesions are more fibrotic (thick, hyperpigmented from repeated injury). However, there isn’t a formally recognized staging beyond such descriptions. Instead, PN is considered part of a spectrum called **“chronic prurigo”** where lesions can be papules, nodules, or plaque-like; PN refers to the nodular end of that spectrum.

- **Resolution (with Treatment or Time):** With effective treatment – for example, using an **IL-4/IL-13 blocker (dupilumab)** or **IL-31 blocker (nemolizumab)** – the itch is reduced, and patients can refrain from scratching. When the itch-scratch cycle is broken, the disease can enter a healing phase. Inflammatory cells recede from the skin, neuropeptide levels normalize, and **fibroblasts revert** to a resting state. The aforementioned single-cell study showed that **nemolizumab treatment** leads to downregulation of the fibrotic COL11A1<sup>+</sup> fibroblast subset and a reversal of keratinocyte hyperproliferation signals ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37506977/#:~:text=Results%3A%20This%20study%20demonstrates%20that,and%20keratinocyte%20responses%20toward%20normal)). Clinically, nodules flatten and soften over weeks to months of therapy, leaving behind post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or scars. Without continued scratching, new lesions stop appearing. However, in long-standing disease, some neural sensitization may linger, and patients can experience flares if therapy is removed – indicating that long-term control may be needed for some.

In summary, the **temporal sequence** of PN is: **trigger → scratching → localized inflammation → papules → persistent scratching → nodules with fibrosis and neural changes → possible generalization**. The **disease progression** is cyclic rather than linear: new lesions can continually form as long as the patient scratches. Importantly, PN does not typically “progress” to systemic illness – it remains skin-limited – but the chronic itch can lead to insomnia, weight loss, and psychosocial decline if not managed. Early intervention to break the itch-scratch cycle is key to halting progression.

## 6. Clinical Phenotypic Manifestations and Mechanistic Links  
The pathophysiological changes in PN translate into distinct **clinical and histopathological phenotypes**:

- **Intense Chronic Pruritus:** The hallmark clinical symptom is **severe chronic itch (pruritus)** (Human Phenotype Ontology: HP:0000989). Patients experience relentless itch in affected areas, often rated as extreme (e.g., 9/10 on severity scales). This itch is typically worse at night and can be exacerbated by heat, sweating, or stress. Mechanistically, this corresponds to the overactive cutaneous **pruriceptors** in PN lesions firing signals due to the abundance of IL-31, histamine-independent pathways, and lowered neural thresholds. The chronicity of itch is fed by the persistent presence of itch mediators (**IL-31, neuropeptides, etc.**) in the skin and by **central sensitization** – over time, the spinal cord becomes primed to amplify itch signals. Clinically, this is evidenced by phenomena like **alloknesis** (light touch causing itch) and **hyperknesis** (a normally mild itch stimulus causing intense itch) on and around PN lesions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121340/#:~:text=match%20at%20L288%20detected%2C%20indicating,fibers%20%5B70%5D.%20Another%20sign%20of)). These correlate with the sprouting of additional nerve fibers and the neurochemical changes in the skin.

- **Pruritic Nodules:** The defining lesions are **firm, hyperkeratotic nodules** (HP:0011351 Skin nodule; often referred to as prurigo nodules). They are typically 0.5–3 cm, with a dome or wart-like appearance, and often have a **crusted or scabbed** center from chronic picking/scratching (HP:0007547 Excoriation). The nodules can be skin-colored, pink, or hyperpigmented (especially in patients with darker skin, lesions heal with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, HP:0001052). The distribution (extensors of arms/legs, outer back, buttocks) reflects mechanical factors – they appear predominantly in **reachable areas** the patient chronically scratches ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1301817/full#:~:text=recalcitrant%20chronic%20pruritus%20and%20keratotic,half%20of%20the%20patients%20with)). The presence of the “butterfly sign” (mid-back clear) is a phenotypic clue specific to chronic scratch disorders like PN ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1301817/full#:~:text=discrete%20nodules%20are%20often%20symmetrically,between%20the%20pathogeneses%20of%20PN)). Mechanistically, each nodule corresponds to a site of ongoing inflammation and fibrosis: the **hardness** of nodules is due to dermal collagen deposition and chronic edema; the **rough, verrucous surface** is due to epidermal hyperplasia and scale (a product of keratinocyte hyperproliferation); the **itchiness** of each nodule is due to the dense innervation and local production of pruritogens.

- **Lichenification and Skin Thickening:** Even areas between nodules may show **lichenified plaques** (thickened skin with exaggerated skin lines, HP:0001585) from chronic rubbing. This is commonly seen on the shins, ankles, or extensor forearms. Lichenification in PN is essentially the same process as in chronic eczema, driven by continual low-grade trauma and IL-13’s effects on skin. It indicates that even beyond distinct nodules, the entire affected skin region is under immune attack and regenerative stress.

- **Pain or Dysesthesia:** Although itch is the predominant symptom, heavily scratched PN lesions can also be painful or tender (some patients feel burning or stinging in lesions, especially if neuropathic changes occur). This might be due to **neuronal damage** by eosinophil toxins and scratching (leading to mixed signals of itch and pain) or due to secondary infection. Notably, PN nodules can become secondarily infected (impetiginized) from scratching – if so, they may develop pustules or increased tenderness (HP:0100758 Skin infection). Pain is not a classic feature of PN, but the overlap of itch and pain pathways means heavily excoriated lesions can cause soreness.

- **Sleep Disturbance and Psychosocial Impact:** The relentless nocturnal itch of PN often leads to **insomnia** (patients wake frequently to scratch). Chronic sleep deprivation and itch can precipitate or worsen **anxiety and depression** (HP:0000739 Depressivity). In fact, *“PN exerts a more significant impact on quality of life and carries a higher risk of psychological disorders (e.g., anxiety and depression) than other pruritic dermatoses”* ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1301817/full#:~:text=harder,PN)). Patients frequently report impaired daily function and mood due to the constant itch. This clinical reality is tied to the biology: chronic inflammation can affect stress pathways, and conversely stress can exacerbate inflammation and itch (via neuroimmune hormones like substance P and adrenaline). The noticeable, sometimes unsightly, lesions also cause embarrassment or social withdrawal, which is a phenotypic aspect (psychological phenotype) of PN’s burden.

- **Histopathology:** If we consider phenotypes at the tissue level, a skin biopsy of PN shows distinctive features correlating with the pathophysiology:
  - **Epidermis:** Irregular acanthosis (thickening) with elongation of rete ridges, hyperkeratosis with compact orthokeratosis (and often some parakeratosis), and frequent excoriation-related ulceration or serous crust. There may be focal hypergranulosis. These features reflect the chronic scratching and regenerative hyperplasia of keratinocytes.
  - **Dermis:** A mixed inflammatory infiltrate, often in a band-like or mid-dermal distribution. Lymphocytes (especially T cells) and histiocytes dominate, with significant numbers of eosinophils and mast cells. The papillary dermis is fibrotic and hardened – collagen bundles appear thickened, and fibrosis may extend around vessels and adnexal structures. Dilated capillaries can be present (from angiogenesis). Sometimes, **neural hyperplasia** can be visualized with special stains (PGP9.5 immunostaining highlighting increased nerve twigs). None of these findings alone are pathognomonic, but together (especially the combination of fibrosis + eosinophils + neuronal changes) they form a tissue phenotype unique to PN, distinguishing it from e.g. plain lichen simplex chronicus or eczema. 

- **Co-morbid Phenotypes:** Many PN patients have co-existing atopic phenotypes (HP:0000872 Atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma). They may have a personal or family history of atopy and elevated total IgE. Clinically, one might find xerosis (dry skin) in PN patients, which is a precipitating factor for itch. Additionally, because PN often affects older individuals (50s-60s on average ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1301817/full#:~:text=that%20PN%20exerts%20a%20more,by%20stromal%20remodeling%20and%20neurovascular))), they may have age-related skin changes or other diseases. There is also an association of PN with metabolic syndrome and diabetes in some studies, as well as with neuropathic conditions (one study reported higher incidence of **peripheral neuropathy etiologies** in PN patients than in those with other skin diseases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7167799/#:~:text=Medicines%20)), suggesting systemic factors like diabetes-induced neuropathy might contribute to itch in some cases).

- **Heterogeneity:** It’s worth noting that PN might not be a completely uniform entity. Emerging evidence (Ständer et al. J Eur Acad Derm Venereol 2025) suggests there may be **subtypes of PN**: some patients show a stronger Th2/eosinophil signature (“allergic” subtype), while others have more TNF/Th1 or neuronal signatures. This could manifest as differences in clinical phenotype: e.g., one subset might have more widespread small nodules with high IgE, and another subset might have fewer but very hypertrophic nodules with more pain. This is still being investigated, but it aligns with PN being a complex disease with varying contributions of immune vs. neural factors in different patients.

**Mechanistic Correlations:** Each clinical feature of PN can thus be traced back to the underlying molecular mechanisms:

- The **intensity of itch** corresponds to **IL-31, IL-4/13, and neuropeptide activity** on sensitized nerve endings.
- The **distribution of lesions** (accessible areas) underscores the necessity of scratching in lesion formation – without the mechanical injury, even severe systemic itch might not create nodules.
- The **nodule morphology** (firm, raised, scaly) reflects **dermal fibrosis** and **epidermal hyperplasia**, directly arising from fibroblast activation and keratinocyte proliferation due to chronic inflammation and trauma.
- The presence of **excoriations** and blood-crusted pick marks on lesions (patients often pick at nodules) indicates that the itch is often out of control, reinforcing the self-injury aspect.
- **Chronic course and recurrence** (lesions typically don’t heal until the itch is treated) is explained by the self-propagating neuroimmune loop – as long as that loop remains active, new lesions form.

Finally, **therapeutic responses** also validate the pathophysiology: for instance, **Dupilumab** (blocking IL-4/IL-13) leads to dramatic itch relief and lesion flattening in many PN patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11099982/#:~:text=There%20is%20currently%20only%20one,variable%20efficacy%20and%20significant%20side)), confirming the role of Th2 cytokines. **Nemolizumab** (blocking IL-31 signaling) similarly reduces itch and even dampens the fibrotic gene signature in lesions ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37506977/#:~:text=dermis%20of%20PN%20skin,and%20keratinocyte%20responses%20toward%20normal)), highlighting IL-31’s contribution to both neural and fibroblast pathology. These clinical outcomes align with the described molecular players, strengthening our understanding that *PN’s phenotype is driven by a type 2 neuroimmune circuit with downstream fibrosis*.
