# The Molecular and Cellular Pathophysiology of Jackson-Weiss Syndrome: A Comprehensive Analysis of FGFR2-Mediated Skeletal Development Disruption

Jackson-Weiss syndrome (JWS) represents a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene located on chromosome 10q26.13, characterized by the distinctive combination of craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull sutures) and foot malformations including broad great toes and tarsal bone abnormalities[1][3][4][20]. The fundamental pathophysiological mechanism underlying JWS involves gain-of-function mutations in FGFR2 that dysregulate the fibroblast growth factor signaling pathway during embryonic skeletal development, leading to accelerated differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts in specific anatomical contexts and disrupted mesenchymal-epithelial signaling during the critical periods of skull and foot formation[1][11][36]. Multiple lines of molecular evidence demonstrate that specific cysteine substitutions in the third immunoglobulin-like domain (IgIII) of FGFR2 promote constitutive receptor dimerization through inter-molecular disulfide bond formation, resulting in ligand-independent activation of downstream signaling cascades including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ) pathways that collectively drive abnormal osteogenic differentiation of skeletal progenitor cells[7][37][52].

## Overview of Jackson-Weiss Syndrome and Historical Context

Jackson-Weiss syndrome was originally characterized in 1976 when Jackson and colleagues identified a large Amish family kindred with 88 affected individuals demonstrating a consistent phenotype of craniosynostosis combined with foot abnormalities, establishing the condition as a distinct genetic entity[4][56]. The syndrome represents one of several FGFR-related craniosynostotic disorders, a group that also includes Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome, and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, all of which involve dysregulation of FGFR signaling but differ in their specific mutation locations and clinical presentations[2][4][56]. The identification of FGFR2 mutations as the causative factor in JWS came in 1994 when Jabs and colleagues demonstrated that Jackson-Weiss and Crouzon syndromes are allelic disorders, meaning they result from different mutations in the same FGFR2 gene but produce overlapping clinical phenotypes with variable expressivity[41]. This seminal discovery revealed that the same amino acid substitutions, such as the Cys342Ser and Cys342Arg mutations, could present with either Jackson-Weiss or Crouzon features, indicating that the distinction between these syndromes is not absolute at the molecular level but rather reflects a spectrum of phenotypic variation influenced by genetic background and potentially other modifier genes[1][15].

The clinical presentation of JWS shows remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity even within families sharing identical FGFR2 mutations, particularly among the Old Order Amish population where the condition has been extensively studied[2][45]. This phenotypic variability spans from individuals presenting primarily with foot abnormalities to others displaying severe multisuture craniosynostosis with additional craniofacial features, suggesting that multiple factors beyond the primary FGFR2 mutation influence disease expression[2][4][31]. The rarity of the condition—exact incidence is unknown but estimated to be extremely low—combined with its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with complete penetrance means that each affected family typically represents a unique opportunity for studying the consequences of specific FGFR2 mutations and their interaction with the genetic background[3][20][56].

## Molecular and Genetic Basis of Jackson-Weiss Syndrome

### FGFR2 Gene Structure and Protein Architecture

The FGFR2 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that undergoes extensive alternative splicing to generate multiple isoforms with tissue-specific expression patterns and distinct ligand-binding preferences[12][32][33]. The gene produces a transmembrane protein consisting of three major structural domains: an extracellular ligand-binding region composed of three immunoglobulin-like loops (IgI, IgII, and IgIII), a single-pass transmembrane domain, and an intracellular catalytic tyrosine kinase domain capable of autophosphorylation and triggering downstream signaling cascades[11][32]. The extracellular portion contains a heparin-binding site that stabilizes fibroblast growth factor-FGFR complexes and modulates ligand availability, while the third immunoglobulin-like domain (IgIII) exists in two major alternatively spliced variants termed IgIIIb and IgIIIc, which bind different sets of FGF ligands[9][12][33]. The IgIIIb isoform, predominately expressed in epithelial tissues and endothelial organ linings, binds to FGF-1, -3, -7, -10, and -22, whereas the IgIIIc isoform, expressed in mesenchymal tissues including craniofacial bone, binds to FGF-1, -2, -4, -6, -8, -9, -17, and -18[12][33]. This tissue-specific isoform distribution is controlled by epithelial splicing regulatory proteins (ESRP1 and ESRP2), which promote the expression of the epithelial IgIIIb form, while mesenchymal cells preferentially express the IgIIIc variant[33].

The mutations identified in Jackson-Weiss syndrome predominantly involve cysteine residues within the third immunoglobulin-like domain, most notably the Cys342 residue, which is normally part of an intra-molecular disulfide bond that stabilizes the native protein structure[1][37][41]. At least six different mutations in the FGFR2 gene have been identified in JWS patients, with each mutation changing a single amino acid in a critical region that is necessary for proper ligand binding and receptor activation[11][36]. The most frequently reported mutations include Cys342Ser, Cys342Arg, Cys342Trp, Gln289Pro, and Ala344Gly, with these substitutions occurring at positions that are highly conserved across FGFR family members and species, indicating the functional importance of these residues[1][15][36]. Remarkably, the same mutations can be found in patients with clinically distinct phenotypes—for example, Cys342Ser has been identified in patients presenting with Jackson-Weiss features, Crouzon syndrome phenotypes, or Pfeiffer syndrome characteristics—demonstrating profound phenotypic heterogeneity at the molecular level[1][31]. This allelic heterogeneity combined with phenotypic heterogeneity suggests that the genetic background, epigenetic factors, and potentially the specific developmental context in which mutations occur may substantially influence disease manifestation[1][15].

### Molecular Mechanisms of FGFR2 Mutation-Induced Pathology

The pathophysiological consequences of Jackson-Weiss syndrome-associated FGFR2 mutations fundamentally arise from a gain-of-function mechanism in which the mutated receptor becomes constitutively active or hypersensitive to FGF ligands, leading to prolonged and intensified downstream signaling[11][36]. In the case of cysteine-substitution mutations, the loss of one cysteine residue from a normally disulfide-bonded pair creates an unpaired cysteine that can form inter-molecular disulfide bonds with a corresponding unpaired cysteine on another FGFR2 molecule, promoting spontaneous receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation independent of ligand binding[37]. Structural studies of the C342R FGFR2 mutant, one of the mutations identified in JWS, have demonstrated that this mutation stabilizes FGFR dimers through inter-molecular disulfide bond formation, and importantly, that these mutations perturb the overall dimer structure in the plasma membrane, potentially altering the orientation and accessibility of the catalytic tyrosine kinase domains[37]. The consequence is that even without ligand binding, the mutant receptors undergo autophosphorylation on critical tyrosine residues in their intracellular domains, particularly Y653 and Y654 in the kinase activation loop, leading to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways[7][11].

The gain-of-function effect of JWS mutations extends beyond simple constitutive activation to include enhanced sensitivity to physiologic concentrations of FGF ligands[11][36]. The mutations alter the ligand-binding properties of FGFR2, and in some cases, as exemplified by Apert syndrome mutations in FGFR2, the receptor gains the ability to be activated by ligands that normally cannot activate it, representing a loss of ligand specificity[36]. For Jackson-Weiss syndrome specifically, the mutations in the IgIII domain affect the critical interface between the receptor and its FGF ligands, promoting stronger or more sustained receptor-ligand interactions that lead to more robust and prolonged signaling[11][36]. Additionally, the mutations appear to alter the normal regulatory mechanisms that would typically attenuate FGFR signaling; for instance, the mutations may reduce the efficiency of negative feedback regulation or alter the trafficking patterns that normally limit signal duration by promoting receptor internalization and degradation[32][33].

## The Fibroblast Growth Factor Signaling Pathway and Its Physiological Functions

### Normal FGF-FGFR Signaling in Skeletal Development

The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway represents one of the critical regulatory systems governing skeletal development, with the FGF family comprising at least eighteen secreted signaling proteins that interact with four distinct FGFRs (FGFR1-4) to regulate diverse cellular processes[17][21][52]. Under physiologic conditions, FGF ligands bind to FGFR receptors in a complex that also requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) present in the extracellular matrix, with this ternary complex formation leading to receptor dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the kinase domain[7][21][32]. Ligand-induced FGFR activation initiates a cascade of downstream signaling pathways, with the primary routes involving phosphorylation of the adaptor protein FRS2α (FGFR substrate 2-alpha), which serves as a critical nodal point recruiting multiple signaling proteins to the activated receptor[7][14][21][33]. From FRS2α phosphorylation, signaling diverges into several major branches: the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through recruitment of growth factor receptor-bound 2 (GRB2) and SOS, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway through GAB1 recruitment, the phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ) pathway, and the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway[7][21][33][52]. Each of these downstream pathways activates specific transcription factors and signaling effectors that ultimately regulate gene expression patterns controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and other critical cellular functions[14][21][52].

In the context of normal skeletal development, FGF signaling plays essential and stage-dependent roles in both endochondral and intramembranous ossification, the two fundamental mechanisms by which skeletal elements form[21][52][58]. During the earliest stages of limb development, FGF signaling from the apical ectodermal ridge (a specialized epithelial structure at the distal tip of the developing limb bud) is absolutely required for limb outgrowth, with targeted loss-of-function mutations in FGFR2 resulting in complete absence of limb development[54][58]. As skeletal development proceeds into the condensation phase, when mesenchymal cells aggregate to form the initial templates for future bones, FGF signaling regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of these osteochondroprogenitor cells[13][21][44][52]. In developing chondrocytes, different FGFRs mediate distinct biological responses: FGFR3 activation generally suppresses chondrocyte proliferation and regulates hypertrophic differentiation, whereas FGFR1 and FGFR2 promote proliferation and regulate the transition to differentiated states[21][52]. Similarly, in osteoblasts at different stages of maturation, FGF signaling has stage-dependent effects—in immature osteoprogenitor cells, FGFR signaling promotes proliferation and early differentiation, whereas in more mature osteoblasts, the effects shift toward regulating mineralization and bone remodeling[21][24][28][39][42][52].

### Dysregulated Signaling in Jackson-Weiss Syndrome

The gain-of-function FGFR2 mutations characteristic of Jackson-Weiss syndrome result in constitutive or exaggerated activation of these normal FGF signaling pathways, with the primary consequence being inappropriately accelerated differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts in specific skeletal compartments[8][11][14][49]. In murine models carrying activating FGFR2 mutations analogous to those found in human JWS, researchers have documented increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and sustained activation of the MAPK pathway in developing skull osteoblasts compared to wild-type controls[8][14][24][39]. The downstream consequences of enhanced ERK1/2 signaling include increased expression and stability of RUNX2 (runt-related transcription factor 2), the master transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation, as well as elevated expression of osteogenic genes such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteopontin[8][24][28][39]. Furthermore, enhanced FGFR2 signaling increases the proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells and promotes their differentiation into mature osteoblasts, leading to an expanded population of bone-forming cells in affected skeletal regions[8][14]. In studies examining osteoblast lineage cell proliferation in skulls of mice carrying the C342Y FGFR2 mutation (a gain-of-function variant), researchers observed a significant increase in the number of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies in bone marrow stromal cells, indicating increased osteoprogenitor production[8].

The enhanced FGF signaling from mutant FGFR2 also promotes the mineralization of bone matrix through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood but appear to involve increased expression of matrix proteins and upregulation of mineralization markers[8][19][21]. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) signaling appears to cooperate with FGF2 signaling in promoting osteogenic differentiation, and studies suggest that FGF2 can stimulate BMP2 expression in osteoblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with BMP2 being required for FGF2-dependent induction of later-stage osteoblast differentiation[19][21][22]. In the context of JWS mutations, the sustained activation of FGFR2 would lead to continuous stimulation of this FGF2-BMP2 cooperative axis, accelerating the maturation and mineralization of osteoblasts beyond the normal developmental timeline. Importantly, the dysregulated signaling caused by JWS mutations appears to be spatially and temporally restricted—not all skeletal elements are affected equally, and the manifestations are most prominent at specific developmental time points when particular skeletal elements are forming, suggesting that the effect of the mutation is context-dependent and influenced by the local developmental environment[8][13][14][49].

## Pathophysiology of Craniosynostosis in Jackson-Weiss Syndrome

### Normal Cranial Suture Development and Homeostasis

The normal development and maintenance of cranial sutures represent a remarkable biological process in which a specialized fibrous connective tissue persists between adjacent skull bones, allowing for skull growth to accommodate brain expansion during development and providing biomechanical flexibility[13][14][49]. Cranial sutures consist of a network of mesenchymal cells in various states of differentiation, including proliferating stem cells, osteoprogenitor cells, differentiating osteoblasts, mature osteoblasts, and mature osteocytes embedded in the mineralized bone matrix[13][49]. During normal development, precise spatial and temporal regulation of osteoprogenitor cell proliferation and differentiation maintains the sutures in an open state until the appropriate developmental stage, at which point coordinated osteoblast differentiation and mineralization leads to suture fusion[13][49]. The cranial sutures fuse in a stereotypic sequence under normal conditions, with the metopic suture closing first (within the first year of life in humans), followed by the sagittal suture (typically fusing between the ages of 20-30), and the lambdoidal and coronal sutures persisting longer[13][14][49]. This orderly fusion process is orchestrated by a complex network of signaling pathways including FGF, BMP, Wnt, Hedgehog, NOTCH, and mechanical signaling, with these pathways working in concert to balance proliferation and differentiation of suture mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs)[13][49][52].

The suture mesenchyme represents a specialized developmental niche where mesenchymal stem cells maintain their undifferentiated state through specific microenvironmental signals and transcription factor networks[13][44][47][49]. Key transcription factors expressed in suture cells and critical for maintaining suture patency include Twist, Msx1/2, Gli1, and Axin2, with these factors regulating the balance between stem cell maintenance and osteogenic differentiation[13][44][49]. The gradient of FGFR expression within sutures plays a crucial regulatory role in this process: FGFR2 is predominantly expressed in proliferating osteoprogenitor cells and is associated with regulating cell proliferation, while FGFR1 expression increases during osteoblast differentiation and appears to promote the maturation process[49]. The normal developmental program involves a transition from FGFR2-dominated (proliferative) to FGFR1-dominated (differentiative) signaling, and this gradient of receptor expression is thought to be essential for balancing proliferation and differentiation to maintain patent sutures during the critical developmental periods[49]. Additionally, the physical relationship between the dura mater (the innermost membrane surrounding the brain) and the cranial vault sutures provides biomechanical signals that influence suture fate—the expanding brain physically pushes outward, generating tensile forces across the sutures that promote their patency, while regions of reduced tension or compression tend toward fusion[13].

### Mechanisms of Premature Suture Fusion in Jackson-Weiss Syndrome

The premature fusion of cranial sutures in Jackson-Weiss syndrome results fundamentally from the dysregulation of the proliferation-differentiation balance in suture mesenchymal stem cells caused by constitutive or enhanced FGFR2 signaling[8][13][14][49]. In the context of a JWS-associated FGFR2 mutation, the persistently elevated FGF signaling drives suture mesenchymal cells prematurely down the osteogenic differentiation pathway, reducing the pool of undifferentiated proliferative cells and increasing the population of differentiated osteoblasts that mineralize and contribute to premature bone formation[14][49]. The mechanism appears to involve accelerated downregulation of the proliferative signals and transcription factors that normally maintain suture patency (such as FGFR2, Twist, and Msx genes) coupled with precocious upregulation of osteogenic differentiation markers and mineralization-associated genes[13][14]. The enhanced ERK1/2 MAPK signaling downstream of mutant FGFR2 promotes RUNX2 activation and accumulation, driving robust expression of osteogenic genes and promoting matrix mineralization[14][24][28]. Furthermore, the enhanced FGFR2 signaling can suppress the expression of genes or pathways that normally inhibit osteogenesis or maintain the mesenchymal stem cell phenotype, creating a cellular environment biased toward bone formation[13][49].

Animal model studies have provided detailed insights into the cellular mechanisms of FGFR-associated craniosynostosis. In mice carrying the P253R mutation in FGFR2 (analogous to the S252W and P253R mutations that cause Apert syndrome in humans, which show similar pathophysiology to JWS mutations), researchers documented increased proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells in the developing coronal sutures at early developmental stages (embryonic day 14.5), with this proliferation being followed by enhanced osteoblast differentiation and accelerated mineralization[8]. The increased proliferation of osteoprogenitors precedes accelerated fusion, suggesting that the primary effect of the mutation is to expand the osteoprogenitor pool, which then undergoes more rapid differentiation than normal[8]. Histomorphometric analysis in these models revealed a significant increase in the number of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies (indicating osteoblast progenitors) and increased bone formation without changes in osteoclastogenic cells, indicating that the pathophysiology involves osteogenic skewing rather than alterations in bone resorption[8][14]. Additionally, studies examining the transcriptional consequences of FGFR2 mutations in suture cells have identified increased expression of osteogenic transcription factors such as Cbfa1/Runx2 and osterix, along with heightened expression of matrix proteins and mineralization enzymes[8][14][39].

An important mechanistic insight from studies of FGFR-associated craniosynostosis is that both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in FGFR2 can lead to premature suture fusion, albeit through different mechanisms[8][13]. This apparent paradox is explained by a regulatory model in which increased FGF signaling downregulates FGFR2 expression and simultaneously upregulates FGFR1 expression in developing osteoblasts[8]. Both excessive and insufficient signaling through the normal FGFR2 → FGFR1 developmental transition lead to a net reduction in FGFR2 signaling in the suture at critical developmental timepoints, disrupting the normal balance and promoting fusion[8]. In JWS, the constitutive FGFR2 activation initially accelerates cell differentiation, but the compensatory downregulation of FGFR2 and upregulation of FGFR1 may further promote the differentiated state, creating a positive feedback loop that drives premature fusion[8][14].

### Spatial and Temporal Specificity of Craniosynostosis in Jackson-Weiss Syndrome

While Jackson-Weiss syndrome presents with craniosynostosis as a cardinal feature, the pattern of suture involvement shows considerable variability, with the coronal suture being one of the most commonly affected sutures, though sagittal, metopic, and lambdoidal sutures can also be involved[2][4][20][45]. The spatial specificity of which sutures become prematurely fused despite ubiquitous expression of the mutant FGFR2 gene suggests that developmental context profoundly influences the manifestation of the mutation's effects[13][49]. Several factors appear to contribute to this spatial selectivity. First, different cranial sutures develop and undergo their normal fusion at different times during development and postnatal growth, meaning that the timing of FGFR2 pathway dysregulation relative to critical periods in specific suture development would determine which sutures are affected[13][49]. Second, neural crest-derived and paraxial mesoderm-derived bones differ in their osteogenic potential and signaling pathway responsiveness; neural crest-derived bones such as the frontal bone show higher levels of FGF pathway activation and greater proliferative capacity than paraxial mesoderm-derived bones such as the parietal bone[44][49]. This developmental origin-dependent difference in FGF signaling responsiveness means that neural crest-derived sutures (such as the metopic suture between the frontal bones) may be more susceptible to dysregulation by FGFR2 mutations[44]. Third, the physical biomechanical environment surrounding each suture—including the developmental growth rate of adjacent bones, the expansion of underlying brain tissue, and the tensile forces generated by dural attachments—influences the susceptibility of that particular suture to premature fusion[13][44]. Fourth, local expression patterns of specific FGF ligands and other signaling molecules differ across different sutures, and the particular FGF isoform distribution in a suture would determine its responsiveness to constitutively activated FGFR2[49].

The temporal specificity of craniosynostosis in Jackson-Weiss syndrome reflects the developmental schedule of specific sutures and the timing of critical windows when suture fate decisions are made[8][13][49]. During the mid-gestational period when skull bones are actively forming and sutures are being established, the enhanced FGFR2 signaling would have the greatest impact on osteoprogenitor cell fate, leading to their premature differentiation before suture identity has been fully established[8][13]. By contrast, in sutures that develop later in gestation or postnatally, the impact of the mutation may be different, depending on the specific developmental program active in those tissues at the time[8][13][49]. Studies in animal models carrying FGFR2 mutations have demonstrated that specific sutures show increased osteoprogenitor cell number and accelerated osteogenic differentiation at discrete developmental timepoints corresponding to the normal fusion schedule for those sutures, further supporting the model that the developmental context determines pathophysiological outcome[8][14].

## Pathophysiology of Foot Abnormalities in Jackson-Weiss Syndrome

### Foot Development and Skeletal Patterning

The development of the foot involves complex interactions between neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells, ectoderm-derived sensory structures, and endoderm-derived tissues, with the foot skeleton forming through a combination of intramembranous and endochondral ossification[21][27][30][44][52]. The tarsal bones of the foot develop through endochondral ossification from mesenchymal condensations, with the initial mesenchymal condensation phase being followed by chondrogenic differentiation, cartilage matrix elaboration, chondrocyte maturation and hypertrophy, vascular invasion, and finally replacement of cartilage by bone[27][30][52]. The metatarsals and phalanges likewise develop through endochondral ossification, but importantly, the digital elements (toes) show more complex patterning in which specific signaling molecules, including FGFs, BMPs, Wnt proteins, and Hedgehog molecules, regulate the number, size, and positioning of digital primordia[21][44][52]. The first digit (great toe) has unique developmental characteristics and distinct signaling inputs compared to the other digits, reflecting its specialized load-bearing and proprioceptive functions[44]. FGF signaling plays particularly important roles in digit development, limb patterning, and bone growth regulation, with both early developmental specification events and later growth regulation being dependent on proper FGF pathway function[21][52][54].

### Molecular Basis of Tarsal and Metatarsal Abnormalities in Jackson-Weiss Syndrome

The foot abnormalities characteristic of Jackson-Weiss syndrome—broad first metatarsals, broad proximal phalanges of the great toes, syndactyly of the second and third toes, tarsal fusion, and flat feet—all relate mechanistically to dysregulation of the normal developmental processes controlling bone growth, patterning, and ossification in the foot skeleton[5][6][50]. The broad appearance of the first metatarsal and proximal phalanges likely results from increased osteoblast proliferation and enhanced bone formation in these specific skeletal elements during development, with the constitutively active FGFR2 driving excessive osteogenic differentiation similar to the mechanism proposed for cranial bone overgrowth[8][14][39]. The enhanced FGF signaling would promote increased matrix deposition and mineralization, leading to thicker, broader bones compared to normal development[8][39]. Tarsal fusion, in which the normally separate tarsal bones (calcaneus, talus, navicular, cuboid, cuneiforms) become partially or completely fused together, represents the fusion of growth plates or syndesmotic joints between these bones, likely resulting from similar mechanisms of accelerated osteogenic differentiation that bridge normally patent articular or syndesmotic spaces with bone[6][49][50].

The syndactyly of the second and third toes is particularly interesting because it represents a disruption of digital separation, a complex developmental process involving coordinated death (apoptosis) of mesenchymal tissue between adjacent digit primordia to establish individual digits[21][44][52]. The enhanced FGF signaling from mutant FGFR2 might disrupt this separation process by either promoting osteogenic differentiation of the interdigital mesenchyme (leading to bone formation that bridges adjacent digits) or by suppressing the apoptosis normally required to separate digits[21][44]. Additionally, the early developmental effects of FGFR2 mutations on mesenchymal condensation and patterning could disrupt the normal positioning of digit primordia, leading to their abnormal proximity or fusion[21][44][52]. The flat feet phenotype likely results from altered tarsal bone development and ossification patterns, with the FGFR2-driven acceleration of bone formation potentially altering the normal three-dimensional architecture of the tarsal skeleton that is essential for the formation of normal arches[50].

### Differences Between Foot and Craniofacial Manifestations

An important observation about Jackson-Weiss syndrome is that the foot abnormalities are more consistent and more severe than the craniofacial manifestations, which show considerable variability in severity and phenotype[2][4][45][56]. This difference in consistency and severity likely reflects developmental timing and tissue-type differences in FGF signaling responsiveness. The foot skeletal elements begin forming during embryonic weeks 6-7 and undergo rapid ossification during the second and third trimester, a period when the constitutively active FGFR2 protein would exert sustained effects on mesenchymal and chondrogenic/osteogenic cells[21][27][52]. The craniofacial skeleton, by contrast, shows a more prolonged and complex developmental program extending from early embryogenesis through the postnatal period, with different cranial bones and sutures being affected at different developmental times[13][27][44]. This extended developmental timeline, combined with the complex anatomy of the cranium and the critical roles of biomechanical and physical expansion signals in regulating suture patency, creates more opportunity for variable manifestation of the mutation's effects[13][44]. Additionally, the foot skeleton undergoes less remodeling postnatally compared to the actively remodeling cranial sutures, so the developmental pattern established in utero is largely maintained, whereas the skull can undergo compensatory changes through continued growth and remodeling that might partially mitigate early developmental defects[13].

Furthermore, the isoform specificity of FGFR2 may differ between craniofacial and foot tissues, with the two major isoforms (FGFR2IIIb and FGFR2IIIc) having different ligand-binding properties and tissue-specific expression patterns[12][33][43]. The craniofacial skeleton is predominantly derived from neural crest cells and shows high expression of FGFR2IIIc, the mesenchymal isoform[12][44][52]. The foot skeleton is also derived from lateral mesoderm and neural crest, but the balance of isoform expression might differ, and the specific FGF ligands available in the developing foot tissues might differ from those in the cranium[12][44][52][54]. If the JWS-associated FGFR2 mutations have different effects on the two isoforms, or if the local FGF ligand environment differs between cranial and foot tissues, this could explain the differential manifestation of disease[12][43].

## Cellular and Tissue-Level Consequences of FGFR2 Dysregulation

### Osteoblast Lineage Effects

The primary cellular consequences of JWS-associated FGFR2 mutations occur in cells of the osteoblast lineage, from osteoprogenitor cells to mature osteoblasts to osteocytes[8][14][21][39][42]. In osteoprogenitor cells, the enhanced FGFR2 signaling promotes proliferation through activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, increasing the number of cells committed to the osteogenic lineage[8][21][24][39][42]. Multiple signaling pathways downstream of activated FGFR2 contribute to promoting osteoprogenitor proliferation: the canonical MAPK/ERK pathway directly promotes cell division and suppresses some differentiation-inhibitory pathways, while the PI3K/Akt pathway promotes cell survival and metabolic changes supporting proliferation[7][21][24][39]. Simultaneously, the enhanced FGFR2 signaling accelerates the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells into mature osteoblasts, promoting the expression of osteogenic transcription factors (particularly RUNX2/Cbfa1 and osterix) and downstream osteogenic genes encoding matrix proteins (type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin) and mineralization enzymes[8][14][21][24][28][39][42]. This combination of increased proliferation and accelerated differentiation expands the population of osteogenic cells in developing bone, leading to increased bone mass and density[8][14][39].

The enhancement of osteoblast mineralization appears to involve multiple mechanisms downstream of FGFR2 activation. The elevated expression of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme critical for generating the inorganic phosphate necessary for mineralization, directly promotes the process[8][21][39]. Furthermore, the activated ERK1/2 pathway promotes the stability and transcriptional activity of RUNX2, which in turn activates genes encoding not only bone matrix proteins but also the molecular machinery for mineralization[24][28][39]. Additionally, studies suggest that enhanced FGF2 signaling stimulates BMP2 expression in osteoblasts, and BMP2 signaling through the SMAD pathway synergizes with FGF signaling to promote later stages of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization[19][21][22]. In mature osteoblasts and osteocytes, enhanced FGFR2 signaling appears to enhance bone-forming activity and potentially suppress bone-resorbing activity through effects on osteoclast regulation[8][21][39][42].

Importantly, the effects of FGFR2 mutations on osteoblasts appear to be context-dependent, with the developmental stage of the cell and the local microenvironmental signals influencing whether the mutation promotes proliferation, differentiation, or mineralization[8][13][21][24][39]. In immature osteoprogenitor cells, the primary effect appears to be enhanced proliferation, whereas in more differentiated osteoblasts, the effects shift toward enhancing differentiation and mineralization markers[39]. This stage-dependent response might explain why different skeletal elements and different developmental stages show variable phenotypic outcomes, as the osteoblasts in different anatomical locations or at different times of development would respond differently to the same mutant FGFR2 signal[8][13][14].

### Mesenchymal Stem Cell and Progenitor Cell Effects

Beyond effects on committed osteoblasts, JWS-associated FGFR2 mutations dysregulate the biology of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their progenitor cells, the developmental precursors that give rise to osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and other mesenchymal cell types[42][44][47]. In bone marrow-derived MSCs and tissue-specific progenitor cells in developing bone, enhanced FGFR2 signaling biases lineage commitment toward osteogenesis at the expense of other differentiation pathways, particularly adipogenesis[39][42]. This lineage-skewing effect involves both positive signals promoting osteogenic differentiation and negative signals suppressing alternative lineages—for example, enhanced FGFR2 signaling suppresses the expression of pro-adipogenic transcription factors while promoting osteogenic transcription factors[39][42]. Studies have demonstrated that FGFR2 knockdown in human MSCs results in downregulation of pro-osteogenic genes and upregulation of pro-adipogenic genes, confirming that normal FGFR2 function biases MSCs toward osteogenesis[42]. The mechanism appears to involve FGFR2-mediated regulation of the epigenetic landscape through effects on EZH2, an epigenetic enzyme that regulates MSC lineage commitment, with FGFR2 signaling suppressing EZH2 levels during osteogenic induction and promoting osteogenic gene expression[42].

Additionally, enhanced FGFR2 signaling affects the self-renewal and maintenance of undifferentiated MSC populations[39][42]. In normal development, specific signaling environments maintain MSCs in a relatively undifferentiated, quiescent state from which they can be mobilized and differentiated when signals for tissue development or regeneration occur[44][47]. Constitutive FGFR2 activation disrupts this balance, driving premature commitment to osteogenic lineages and reducing the pool of undifferentiated progenitor cells available for maintaining tissues or responding to developmental signals[42][49]. This effect is particularly consequential in the context of cranial sutures, where the continuous presence of undifferentiated suture stem cells is essential for maintaining suture patency during development and early postnatal growth[13][49].

### Chondrocyte and Endochondral Ossification Effects

While the primary effects of JWS mutations on skeletal development appear to be in osteogenic cells, there is evidence of secondary effects on chondrocytes and endochondral ossification. In some models of FGFR-associated craniosynostosis, modest effects on chondrocyte proliferation have been observed, with slightly decreased proliferation in skull base chondrocytes during certain developmental stages[8]. However, these effects on chondrocytes appear to be minor compared to the robust effects on osteogenic cells, and the major pathophysiology is not primarily a chondrodysplasia but rather an osteogenic disorder. The foot abnormalities in JWS, while involving tarsal bones that develop through endochondral ossification, appear to result primarily from accelerated osteogenic differentiation and enhanced bone formation rather than primary chondrocyte defects[6][50].

## Disease Progression and Developmental Timeline

### Prenatal and Early Postnatal Manifestations

The pathophysiological events underlying Jackson-Weiss syndrome begin during embryonic development when the mutant FGFR2 protein is first expressed in developing mesenchymal tissues that will give rise to the skull and limb skeleton. During the first and second trimester of human pregnancy (corresponding to embryonic days 6-12 in mice), mesenchymal cells begin condensing to form the primordia for future skeletal elements, and during this critical phase, enhanced FGFR2 signaling would promote osteogenic differentiation of these condensing mesenchymal cells[27][44]. The effects would be most pronounced in tissues expressing FGFR2IIIc, the mesenchymal isoform predominant in developing bone[12][27][44][52]. By the second and third trimester, when active bone formation is occurring, the consequences of altered osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation become evident in the form of altered bone growth patterns. In the foot skeleton, which undergoes relatively rapid ossification during the second and third trimester, the enhanced osteogenic signaling would lead to the characteristic broad metatarsals and phalanges and aberrant tarsal bone fusions that are already present at birth in affected individuals[5][6][50][56].

For the craniofacial skeleton, the first trimester is critical for establishing the basic skeletal pattern and for the initial formation of cranial bones through intramembranous ossification[27][44]. The enhanced FGFR2 signaling would drive accelerated osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in the developing frontal, parietal, and temporal bones, potentially leading to the initial misalignment of sutures[13][44][49]. However, the severity of craniofacial features at birth is variable, suggesting that the initial pathophysiological changes might be subtle and that additional changes occur during late prenatal development and early postnatal life[2][4][45]. In some affected individuals, craniofacial manifestations may be minimal at birth and become progressively more evident over the first months to years of postnatal life as the brain grows and as postnatally active growth and remodeling processes amplify the initial developmental defects[13]. Indeed, the timing of diagnosis in Jackson-Weiss syndrome patients is often in early infancy when craniosynostosis becomes clinically evident through physical examination or imaging, sometimes weeks to months after birth[2][4].

The key pathophysiological events in the prenatal period that establish the disease include accelerated osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation in developing cranial sutures, leading to increased osteoblast numbers and enhanced bone formation at the suture margins. This increased bone formation in the context of sutures that normally remain open creates physical tension and stress within the sutures, eventually culminating in their fusion. Similarly, in the foot skeleton, the enhanced osteogenic differentiation leads to the characteristic bone abnormalities that are typically fully manifest by birth.

### Postnatal Progression and Secondary Consequences

After birth, Jackson-Weiss syndrome undergoes a progressive course characterized primarily by the clinical consequences of craniosynostosis developing or advancing over time[2][4][20]. The premature fusion of cranial sutures prevents normal expansion of the skull in response to ongoing brain growth, leading to characteristic head shape abnormalities (acrocephaly, anterior plagiocephaly, or other dysmorphologies depending on which sutures are involved), increased intracranial pressure, and secondary complications including hydrocephalus, optic nerve compression causing vision loss, and in severe cases, intellectual disability or developmental delay[2][4][20][45][48]. The progression of these secondary complications is determined by the extent and location of suture fusion, the pressure-volume relationships in the cranium, and the adequacy of compensatory growth through patent sutures[13]. In the most severe cases, multiple sutures fuse simultaneously or in close temporal succession, severely restricting cranial expansion and creating severe increased intracranial pressure requiring urgent neurosurgical intervention[4][13][20].

The craniofacial features develop progressively during early childhood as a consequence of abnormal skull growth patterns and the skeletal dysplasia affecting midface structures. The characteristic midfacial hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the midface) in JWS patients likely results from disrupted growth of maxillary bones secondary to craniosynostosis affecting frontal and adjacent structures, combined with possible primary effects of FGFR2 mutations on maxillary bone development[2][4][20][45]. The proptosis (forward protrusion of the eyes) observed in many JWS patients results from the shallow orbits created by altered cranial vault growth and midfacial hypoplasia, pushing the eye contents forward[2][20][45]. Additional craniofacial features including high-arched palate, dental abnormalities, and external ear malformations likely result from similar disruptions in craniofacial skeletal development[2][4][20].

In the extremities, the foot abnormalities are established during prenatal development and typically do not show progressive change postnatally, though functional impairments may become more apparent as the child grows and begins bearing weight on the affected feet[5][6][50][56]. The broad great toes, syndactylous digits, and tarsal bone abnormalities are relatively stable features that become functionally significant as the child develops ambulatory skills. Some affected individuals may eventually benefit from orthopedic surgery to address severe foot deformities that interfere with normal gait or footwear fitting, but the fundamental skeletal dysplasia does not typically progress substantially after the prenatal period[5][6][50]. The hand skeleton, which would theoretically be subject to similar developmental insults from the FGFR2 mutation, remains remarkably spared in JWS, distinguishing it from conditions like Apert syndrome where prominent hand abnormalities including severe syndactyly are characteristic[2][4][31][45]. This preservation of hand anatomy despite the presence of foot abnormalities remains mechanistically incompletely understood but suggests that the developmental environment of the hand is either less susceptible to the effects of the FGFR2 mutation or that the specific FGF ligand environment differs in hand versus foot tissues[31].

The long-term progression of Jackson-Weiss syndrome depends heavily on whether neurosurgical intervention is undertaken to address craniosynostosis and secondary complications[4][20][48]. With appropriate surgical correction of severe craniosynostosis, expanded intracanial space, and relief of increased intracranial pressure, the prognosis for normal development and quality of life is considerably improved[4][20][48]. Untreated severe craniosynostosis, by contrast, leads to progressive neurological complications and potential cognitive impairment due to chronic increased intracranial pressure[4][20][48]. The intellectual outcomes in JWS patients who receive appropriate surgical care are generally favorable, with most affected individuals having intelligence within the normal range, demonstrating that the FGFR2 mutation does not directly impair brain development but rather causes neurological complications secondary to the skeletal changes[2][4][20][45][56].

## Signaling Pathways and Molecular Network Interactions

### MAPK/ERK Pathway and Osteogenic Differentiation

The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway represents the primary effector pathway through which FGFR2 mutations drive osteogenic differentiation in JWS[8][14][21][24][39]. Activation of this pathway begins with the phosphorylation of FRS2α following FGFR2 activation, with phosphorylated FRS2α recruiting GRB2 and activating the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade[7][21][33][39][52]. The activated ERK1/2 kinases then phosphorylate multiple downstream substrates, with a critical target being RUNX2, the master transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation[24][28][39]. ERK1/2 phosphorylation of RUNX2 at multiple sites (S43, S301, S319, S410) stabilizes the protein and enhances its transcriptional activity, promoting the expression of osteogenic target genes including alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, and collagen type I[24][28][39]. Importantly, the degree of ERK1/2 activation is proportional to the strength of FGFR2 signaling, and mutations that enhance FGFR2 activity, such as those in JWS, produce elevated and sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared to cells with wild-type FGFR2[8][14][24][39]. This sustained ERK1/2 activation would produce persistent upregulation of RUNX2 and downstream osteogenic genes, driving the premature and accelerated osteogenic differentiation characteristic of JWS[8][14][24][39].

The MAPK/ERK pathway also regulates cell cycle progression and proliferation in osteoprogenitor cells, with ERK activation promoting the expression of genes controlling G1/S phase transition and DNA replication[24][39]. Therefore, the enhanced ERK1/2 signaling from JWS-associated FGFR2 mutations would simultaneously promote proliferation of osteoprogenitors and differentiation into mature osteoblasts, creating an expanded pool of bone-forming cells—a consequence fully consistent with the observed increase in alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies and osteoblast numbers in animal models and inferred from the increased bone formation and density in affected patients[8][14][39].

### PI3K/Akt Pathway and Cell Survival

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway represents another major signaling branch downstream of activated FGFR2, with this pathway promoting cell survival and metabolic changes supporting anabolic processes including bone formation[7][21][33][39][52]. Activation of this pathway involves recruitment of PI3K to the activated receptor complex through adaptor proteins, with activated PI3K then generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, serving as a docking site for proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, including Akt[7][21]. Once recruited to the membrane, Akt undergoes phosphorylation and activation, then phosphorylates multiple downstream targets including the forkhead transcription factor FOXO, tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), collectively promoting protein synthesis, glycolysis, and other anabolic processes while suppressing apoptosis[7][21][39]. In the context of osteoblasts, PI3K-Akt signaling promotes cell survival during the differentiation process and may promote metabolic support for the energetically expensive process of matrix synthesis and mineralization[21][39][42]. The enhanced PI3K-Akt signaling from JWS-associated FGFR2 mutations would therefore promote osteoblast survival and anabolic metabolism, contributing to the increased bone formation observed in these patients[39][42].

### Crosstalk with BMP Signaling

An important interaction in the pathophysiology of JWS involves crosstalk between FGF signaling through FGFR2 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling[19][21][22][52]. BMP signaling through BMP2, BMP4, and BMP9 is essential for osteogenic differentiation through a distinct pathway involving SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation, leading to activation of osteogenic genes overlapping with but distinct from the MAPK-RUNX2 pathway[19][21][28][52]. Importantly, FGF2 signaling can stimulate BMP2 expression in osteoblasts in a dose-dependent manner, and studies suggest that FGF2 enhances the canonical BMP signaling pathway by promoting nuclear localization of phospho-SMAD1/5/8 and increasing their interaction with RUNX2[19][21][22]. In the context of JWS, the constitutively active FGFR2 would continuously stimulate BMP2 expression, creating sustained activation of both the FGFR2-MAPK-RUNX2 pathway and the BMP-SMAD1/5/8 pathway, with these pathways synergizing to drive robust osteogenic differentiation and mineralization[19][21][22]. This cooperative interaction between FGF and BMP signaling may explain why the osteogenic effects of FGFR2 mutations are so pronounced—the mutation not only directly activates downstream signaling pathways but also amplifies the effect by promoting BMP signaling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives accelerated bone formation[19][21][22].

### Negative Feedback Regulation and Desensitization

Normal FGFR signaling includes multiple negative feedback mechanisms that limit signal duration and prevent excessive activation, with several of these regulatory systems being potentially dysregulated in JWS[7][9][14][33]. One important negative feedback pathway involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL (casitas B-lineage lymphoma), which binds to the activated receptor complex and catalyzes ubiquitination of FGFR and FRS2, targeting them for proteasomal degradation[7][33][52]. This ligand-dependent feedback mechanism normally ensures that FGFR signaling is transient; however, in JWS where the receptor is constitutively active or hypersensitive to ligands, the normal ligand-dependent feedback regulation would be dysregulated. Additionally, the normal desensitization mechanisms involving receptor trafficking to endosomal compartments and eventual lysosomal degradation might be altered in the context of constitutively active FGFR2[33]. The consequence would be that the mutant FGFR2 maintains higher steady-state levels of phosphorylation and downstream signaling compared to normal receptors, driving persistent activation of osteogenic pathways[8][14][39].

Another negative feedback mechanism involves the ERK pathway itself, as activated ERK1/2 can phosphorylate the C-terminal tail of FGFR2 at Ser777, inhibiting further tyrosine kinase activity[7]. However, in the context of constitutively active FGFR2 from JWS mutations, this feedback inhibition might be overwhelmed by the persistent intrinsic kinase activity of the mutant receptor[7]. Furthermore, the mutations that give rise to JWS, which predominantly involve cysteine substitutions in the IgIII domain, would not be expected to directly affect C-terminal regulatory sequences, so the normal feedback inhibitory mechanisms might remain partially functional but be insufficient to suppress the enhanced kinase activity of the constitutively active mutant receptor[37].

### Transcriptional Programs Downstream of Dysregulated Signaling

The integrated consequence of dysregulated MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and BMP signaling in JWS is the activation of a transcriptional program that strongly favors osteogenic differentiation and bone formation[8][14][24][28][39][42]. Key transcription factors activated by these pathways include RUNX2 (which activates the osteocalcin, osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and collagen type I genes), osterix/SP7 (which serves as a coactivator for RUNX2), AP-1 factors (which regulate multiple osteogenic genes), and STAT1/STAT3 (which have roles in osteogenic gene expression)[24][28][39][42]. Additionally, the transcriptional program involves upregulation of genes encoding the molecular machinery for mineralization, including alkaline phosphatase (which generates inorganic phosphate), PHOSPHO1 (which regulates mineralization initiation), and various enzymes and transporters involved in mineral deposition[21][39]. Simultaneously, the osteogenic transcriptional program includes suppression of genes that would otherwise promote cell division and maintain the proliferative phenotype, including growth factor receptors and cell cycle regulators, creating a shift from proliferative to differentiative behavior as cells progress through the osteogenic differentiation pathway[21][39][42]. The net result is the characteristic transcriptional signature of accelerated osteogenic differentiation and enhanced bone formation observed in JWS[8][14][39].

## Clinical Phenotypic Manifestations and Their Molecular Basis

### Craniofacial Features

The craniofacial manifestations of Jackson-Weiss syndrome directly result from dysregulated bone development in the skull and facial skeleton and the secondary biomechanical consequences of premature suture fusion[2][4][20][45]. The characteristic frontal bossing (prominent forehead) results from accelerated growth of the frontal bones and the bulging that occurs when the sagittal and coronal sutures fuse prematurely, preventing normal lateral expansion of the frontal lobes and forcing bone growth to proceed anteriorly[2][13][20][45]. The acrocephaly (pointed or tower-shaped skull) results from a combination of restricted lateral growth secondary to suture fusion and compensatory vertical growth, creating the characteristic peaked appearance[2][13][20][45]. The midfacial hypoplasia, one of the most distinctive features of JWS, reflects underdevelopment of the maxilla and midface skeleton secondary to the dysregulated bone development in this region and the secondary effects of altered cranial vault expansion patterns[2][20][45]. The shallow orbits that result from midfacial hypoplasia and altered orbital bone development lead to proptosis (forward protrusion of the eyes), which can be further accentuated by increased intracranial pressure pushing the eye contents forward[2][20][45].

Additional craniofacial features including downslanted palpebral fissures, ocular hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), ptosis (drooping eyelids), and strabismus (crossed eyes) all result from the overall dysplasia of the orbital and periorbital structures caused by the skeletal abnormalities[2][4][20][45]. The flat nasal bridge likely reflects altered development of nasal bone and frontal process of the maxilla, while cleft palate observed in some patients reflects disrupted development of palatal shelves during embryogenesis, possibly secondary to the broader effects of FGFR2 dysregulation on craniofacial mesenchymal development[2][4][20]. Hearing loss reported in some JWS patients may result from conductive hearing loss secondary to middle ear ossicle abnormalities or eustachian tube dysfunction related to cranial base dysplasia, or potentially from sensorineural components[2][4][20]. Malformed ears reflect disrupted development of ear structures derived from pharyngeal arch mesenchyme, with the severity of ear abnormalities varying considerably among affected individuals[2][4].

### Foot Abnormalities

The foot abnormalities in Jackson-Weiss syndrome represent the most consistent and penetrant manifestations, present in essentially all affected individuals, and directly reflect dysregulated skeletal development in the foot skeleton[2][4][5][6][20][50][56]. The broad first metatarsal and broad proximal phalanx of the great toe result from increased osteogenic differentiation and enhanced bone formation in these specific skeletal elements during prenatal development[5][6][50]. The medial deviation (inward bending) of the great toe likely results from altered patterning of the first digit during development, possibly involving disrupted FGF signaling that normally specifies digit position and orientation[5][6][50]. The syndactyly of the second and third toes, though variable in severity, likely results from reduced apoptosis in the interdigital mesenchyme that normally separates adjacent digits, allowing mesenchymal cells to persist and differentiate into bone that bridges the normally separate digits[21][44]. The tarsal bone fusions reflect premature ossification and fusion of joints (syndesmoses) between tarsal bones that normally remain patent to allow flexibility and load distribution within the foot[5][6][50].

The flat feet phenotype, which may develop or become more apparent with age and weight-bearing, results from altered three-dimensional architecture of the tarsal skeleton secondary to the disrupted bone development and fusions[5][6][50]. These foot abnormalities, while not immediately life-threatening, can lead to functional impairments in gait and weight distribution, and may necessitate orthopedic intervention in some cases[5][6][50][56].

### Neurological and Developmental Outcomes

The neurological complications of Jackson-Weiss syndrome result primarily from the secondary consequences of craniosynostosis rather than from direct effects of the FGFR2 mutation on brain development itself[2][4][20][48]. The premature fusion of cranial sutures restricts skull expansion, preventing normal accommodation of ongoing brain growth, which leads to increased intracranial pressure[13][20][48]. In its mild form, increased intracranial pressure can cause headaches and visual disturbances; in more severe cases, it can cause cognitive impairment, developmental delay, and other neurological sequelae[2][4][20][48]. However, with appropriate surgical intervention to relieve elevated intracranial pressure and expanded intracanial space, the neurological outcomes are favorable, demonstrating that the primary pathophysiology is mechanical (skull constraint) rather than a primary developmental abnormality of the brain itself[4][20][48]. Most JWS patients with appropriate surgical care have normal intelligence and normal development, with psychometric testing revealing IQs in the normal range[2][4][45][56]. Some individuals, particularly those with very severe untreated craniosynostosis, may develop intellectual disability as a consequence of chronic elevated intracranial pressure, but this represents a secondary complication rather than a primary manifestation of the genetic mutation[2][4][20].

## Conclusion

Jackson-Weiss syndrome represents a prototypic FGFR-mediated skeletal disorder in which heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in the FGFR2 gene dysregulate the fibroblast growth factor signaling pathway during skeletal development, leading to accelerated osteogenic differentiation, enhanced bone formation, and the characteristic phenotype of craniosynostosis combined with foot abnormalities[1][3][4][11][36]. The molecular basis of the disease involves constitutive or hypersensitive FGFR2 activation through multiple mechanisms—including constitutive receptor dimerization via inter-molecular disulfide bonds, enhanced ligand sensitivity, and dysregulation of normal negative feedback mechanisms—that lead to sustained activation of downstream signaling pathways including MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and BMP signaling cascades[7][8][37][39]. These pathways converge on osteogenic transcription factors, particularly RUNX2, driving robust upregulation of osteogenic genes and promoting the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells into mature bone-forming osteoblasts while simultaneously suppressing alternative lineages and promoting cell survival through enhanced metabolic support[24][28][39][42][52]. The pathophysiological consequences manifest as premature fusion of cranial sutures through mechanisms involving accelerated osteogenic differentiation in suture mesenchymal cells and disruption of the normal proliferation-differentiation balance that maintains sutures in a patent state during normal development[8][13][14][49]. Simultaneously, similar mechanisms in developing foot skeleton lead to the characteristic foot abnormalities including broad metatarsals and phalanges, syndactyly, and tarsal fusions[5][6][50].

The spatial and temporal specificity of disease manifestations—with the foot abnormalities being consistently severe and present at birth while craniofacial features show variable severity and late presentation—reflects the complex interplay between developmental timing, tissue-specific FGF signaling responsiveness, isoform-specific differences in FGFR2 expression, local FGF ligand availability, biomechanical factors influencing bone development and suture patency, and genetic background effects[2][4][8][13][14][44][49]. Future therapeutic approaches may target the dysregulated signaling pathways, with potential strategies including FGFR-selective kinase inhibitors, downstream pathway inhibitors (particularly MAPK/ERK pathway inhibitors), or modulation of crosstalk pathways such as BMP signaling to restore the normal balance of osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation[14][24][49]. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of JWS not only illuminates the pathophysiology of this rare disease but also provides insights into the normal regulation of skeletal development and homeostasis, with implications for understanding other skeletal dysplasias and for developing therapies targeting bone disorders more broadly.
