Disease Pathophysiology Research Report: Short-Rib Polydactyly Syndrome (SRPS) / Short-Rib Thoracic Dysplasia (SRTD)

Target Disease
- Disease Name: Short-Rib Polydactyly Syndrome (SRPS) / Short-Rib Thoracic Dysplasia (SRTD)
- MONDO ID: Not confidently resolved here; SRPS/SRTD are classified within skeletal ciliopathies in current nosology. Please verify MONDO mapping during curation.
- Category: Mendelian (autosomal recessive)

Pathophysiology summary
Short-Rib Polydactyly Syndrome and the broader SRTD spectrum are skeletal ciliopathies caused by dysfunction of the primary cilium, most often due to variants in intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery (IFT-A, IFT-B) or the retrograde IFT motor dynein-2. Disrupted ciliary trafficking perturbs Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in limb bud mesenchyme and growth-plate chondrocytes, leading to abnormal skeletal patterning (polydactyly) and chondrodysplasia with thoracic insufficiency, and extends to kidney and retinal phenotypes in overlapping syndromes (e.g., Mainzer–Saldino, Jeune). DYNC2H1 (dynein-2 heavy chain) is a major genetic cause; IFT140/IFT-A defects model short-rib phenotypes with ciliation loss and Hh pathway disruption. Prenatal diagnosis increasingly combines systematic ultrasound with exome sequencing to resolve the high genetic heterogeneity of lethal skeletal dysplasias. (xiong2025anovelcompound pages 8-8, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 16-20, getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18, markova2022сlinicalandgenetic pages 9-11, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)

1) Core Pathophysiology
- Primary mechanisms: Defective intraflagellar transport (anterograde IFT-B and retrograde IFT-A/dynein-2) compromises ciliary structure and signaling competence. In limb and cartilage lineages, this dysregulates Sonic/Ihh signaling required for digit number/patterning and growth-plate proliferation–hypertrophy transitions, producing polydactyly and severe thoracic and long-bone shortening. Kidney tubule and retinal photoreceptor cilia involvement explains cystic kidney disease and retinal degeneration in overlapping phenotypes. (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)
  - Evidence: “Ift80 and ift172 models… exhibited severe limb deformities, polydactyly… and ciliogenesis defects… implicating cilia-dependent signaling (Hedgehog) in skeletal outcomes.” bioRxiv, Nov 2020, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.27.400994 (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18)
  - Evidence: Ift140 mutant analyses show “low incidence of ciliation” and “disrupted cilia-transduced Shh signaling” with thoracic dystrophy and polydactyly in mice. bioRxiv, Jun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.07.544132 (francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 16-20, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)
- Dysregulated pathways: Hedgehog signaling (Shh in limb bud; Ihh in growth plate) is primary; IFT dysfunction can variably modulate Hh outputs in vivo. Additional contributions from Wnt and cilia-associated microtubule modifications (e.g., tubulin polyglutamylation) are implicated. (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18)
- Affected cellular processes: Ciliogenesis, intraciliary cargo transport (anterograde/retrograde), ciliary maintenance, signal transduction; chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation; epithelial polarity in kidney tubules. (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)

2) Key Molecular Players
- Genes/Proteins (HGNC): DYNC2H1 (dynein-2 heavy chain), DYNC2LI1, WDR60, WDR34, IFT140, WDR19/IFT144, WDR35/IFT121, TTC21B/IFT139, IFT172, IFT80, IFT52, TRAF3IP1/IFT54, IFT43, IFT22, NEK1. Roles span dynein-2 motor assembly/function and IFT-A/B particle integrity. (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18, markova2022сlinicalandgenetic pages 9-11, xiong2025anovelcompound pages 8-8)
  - Expert/clinical emphasis: DYNC2H1 is a recurrent cause for SRTD/SRPS; compound heterozygous variants are common in severe prenatal/infantile cases. Front-line genomics (WES/RNA-seq) resolves diverse variant classes. Hereditas, Jan 2025, https://doi.org/10.1186/s41065-025-00375-x (xiong2025anovelcompound pages 8-8)
  - Quantitative note: DYNC2H1 accounts for a large subset of SRTD3; a 2022 overview notes it “cause[s] SRTD3” and is cited in >50% of such cases in compilations. (markova2022сlinicalandgenetic pages 9-11)
- Chemical entities (CHEBI): Not primary etiologic drivers; pathway reference points include Hh morphogens (proteins). Post-translational tubulin modifications (polyglutamylation) modulate ciliary function mechanistically. (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18)
- Cell types (CL): Growth plate chondrocytes; limb bud mesenchymal cells; kidney tubular epithelium; respiratory epithelium; retinal photoreceptors. (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)
- Anatomical locations (UBERON): Developing limb/limb bud; thoracic cage/ribs; tracheobronchial tree and lungs; kidney; retina. (francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 16-20, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)

3) Biological Processes (GO) disrupted
- Intraciliary transport; retrograde ciliary transport; cilium assembly/organization; Hedgehog signaling pathway; chondrocyte differentiation; epithelial morphogenesis of branching organs (lung); kidney tubule development. (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)

4) Cellular Components
- Primary cilium (axoneme, ciliary membrane), basal body/centrosome; IFT-A and IFT-B particle complexes; dynein-2 motor complex. (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)

5) Disease Progression (sequence from genotype to phenotype)
- Initiating lesion: Biallelic pathogenic variants in dynein-2 (e.g., DYNC2H1) or IFT-A/B genes impair retrograde/anterior IFT and/or ciliogenesis. (xiong2025anovelcompound pages 8-8, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)
- Cellular dysfunction: Reduced/abnormal ciliation and defective trafficking in chondrocytes/mesenchyme lead to mis-specified Hh signaling gradients and growth-plate maturation defects. (francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 16-20, getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18)
- Tissue/organ effects: Abnormal endochondral ossification yields short ribs/long bones and narrow bell-shaped thorax; limb patterning errors yield polydactyly. Ciliary dysfunction in kidney tubules predisposes to cystic changes; retinal involvement leads to degeneration in overlapping phenotypes. (francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24, getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18)
- Clinical manifestation: Perinatal respiratory failure due to thoracic insufficiency is a major determinant of lethality; spectrum overlaps with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and Mainzer–Saldino. (markova2022сlinicalandgenetic pages 9-11)

6) Phenotypic Manifestations (HPO)
- Core skeletal: Short ribs (HP:0000773), Narrow thorax (HP:0000774), Short long bones (HP:0003026), Polydactyly (HP:0010442), Thoracic insufficiency (HP:0004421). (francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 16-20, markova2022сlinicalandgenetic pages 9-11)
- Multisystem (variable): Renal cysts (HP:0000107), Retinal degeneration (HP:0000556). (francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)

7) Nosology and spectrum
- Historical SRPS types I–IV are now encompassed by SRTD subtypes with/without polydactyly; there is broad overlap with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and Mainzer–Saldino syndrome, reflecting shared ciliary pathobiology. (markova2022сlinicalandgenetic pages 9-11, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 16-20)

8) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- IFT-A defects and cell autonomy: Mouse Ift140 studies (2023) delineate both cell-autonomous (e.g., limb mesenchyme, neural crest) and non–cell-autonomous contributions to structural birth defects, linking cilia loss to altered Shh signaling and thoracic/lung hypoplasia, craniofacial malformations, and polydactyly. bioRxiv, Jun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.07.544132 (francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 16-20, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)
- Dynein-2 genetics and diagnostics: Recent clinical genetics highlight recurring DYNC2H1 causal variants and use of prenatal WES/RNA-seq to resolve ambiguous ultrasound phenotypes in SRTD/Jeune families. Hereditas, Jan 2025, https://doi.org/10.1186/s41065-025-00375-x (xiong2025anovelcompound pages 8-8)
- Mechanistic breadth in IFT disruption: Experimental systems emphasize that perturbations across IFT-B core (IFT80/IFT172) and IFT-A (TTC21B, WDR35, IFT43) converge on ciliary transport failure and Hh misregulation in skeletal lineages. bioRxiv, Nov 2020, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.27.400994 (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18, getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 19-21)

9) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Prenatal imaging plus genomics: Systematic second/third-trimester ultrasound recognizing short ribs, narrow thorax, and limb anomalies combined with exome sequencing is increasingly used to confirm SRPS/SRTD and counsel families. Recent dynein-2 case series and reports underscore WES utility in recurrent-affected families and variant interpretation. Hereditas, Jan 2025, https://doi.org/10.1186/s41065-025-00375-x (xiong2025anovelcompound pages 8-8)
- Model systems for functional interpretation: IFT/dynein-2 perturbation in Xenopus and mouse models reproduces cardinal human phenotypes (polydactyly, thoracic dystrophy, renal cysts), supporting variant pathogenicity assessment frameworks. bioRxiv, Nov 2020, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.27.400994; bioRxiv, Jun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.07.544132 (getwan2020crisprcas9targetingttc30a pages 16-18, francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)

10) Expert opinions and analysis
- SRTD as a ciliopathy spectrum: Reviews and compiled clinical genetics emphasize DYNC2H1 as a predominant gene in SRTD3 and underscore that respiratory failure from thoracic insufficiency drives lethality; exome sequencing is the primary tool to resolve genetic heterogeneity. (markova2022сlinicalandgenetic pages 9-11)
  - Quote: “Pathogenic variants of DYNC2H1… have been reported to cause SRTD3,” and phenotypes include “a narrow thorax, short ribs, shortened tubular bones.” BMC Med Genomics abstract (supportive of dynein-2 causality; see also compiled overview) (markova2022сlinicalandgenetic pages 9-11)
- Developmental windows and lineage specificity: Ift140 studies indicate early embryonic windows and lineage-specific disruptions (neural crest, limb mesenchyme) underlie polydactyly/thoracic and craniofacial defects, clarifying variable phenotypic expressivity within the SRTD spectrum. bioRxiv, Jun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.07.544132 (francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 16-20)

11) Relevant statistics and data
- Gene burden: DYNC2H1 is frequently implicated in SRTD/SRPS; curated overviews report it as the leading cause of SRTD3 and a substantial fraction of SRTD overall. (markova2022сlinicalandgenetic pages 9-11)
- Multisystem frequencies: IFT140-related SRTD often associates with retinal and renal involvement, consistent with IFT-A roles and mouse knockouts demonstrating renal and ciliary defects. bioRxiv, Jun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.07.544132 (francis2023autonomousandnoncell pages 20-24)
