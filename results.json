To assess this apparent resistance quantitatively, we treated the cells in suspension and measured the loss of phalloidin-stained filamentous actin, using flow cytometry. Consistent with the microscopy results, the mutant lymphoblasts were resistant to latrunculin A over a wide range of drug concentrations (fig. \u200b(fig.9A9A and \u200band9B).9B). In contrast, when the drug was washed out, actin repolymerized to the same baseline levels in both control and mutant cells, irrespective of the extent of the latrunculin-induced actin depolymerization (fig. \u200b(fig.9C9C and \u200band9D9D).",

Comparable results were obtained with the other cell lines with mutated actin genes. The two representative mutant cell lines both had greatly increased F-actin content and multiple, anomalous F-actin\u2013rich, filopodia-like protrusions compared to control cells, resulting in increased cell perimeter. They probed the stability of F-actin using latrunculin A, which binds actin monomers, thereby preventing their incorporation into growing filaments. Both representative mutant cell lines showed altered sensitivity to latrunculin A, albeit with different outcomes. They observed increased resistance to latrunculin A in mutant cells with the \u03b2-actin p.Arg196His alteration relative to controls, which is consistent with the effect of the previously reported p.Arg183Trp alteration. Immunofluorescent staining of F-actin in lymphoblastoid cell lines from the affected individuals showed patterns of cytoskeletal changes and abnormal accumulation of F-actin that were reproducible between independent cell lines carrying the same alteration.",

In contrast, fetuses and newborn Agpat2-/- mice have preserved adipose tissue. However, lipodystrophy results from massive adipocyte death and inflammatory infiltration of the adipose tissue during the first week of life was observed.  At the ultrastructural level, white adipocytes in newborn Agpat2-/- were smaller and had a marked reduction of plasma membrane caveolae, abnormally structured mitochondria and irregular LDs. In addition, enhanced accumulation of autophagic structures observed in Agpat2-/-adipocytes. In vitro studies showed that Agpat2-/- MEF cells display impaired adipogenesis, characterized by a reduced number of adipocytes and ultrastructural abnormalities in lipid droplets, mitochondria, and plasma membrane. Overexpression of PPARg increase the number of Agpat2-/- MEFs that differentiated into adipocyte-like cells but did not prevent morphological abnormalities and cell death.\nThis study concludes that lipodystrophy in Agpat2 -/- mice results from postnatal cell death of adipose tissue in combination with acute local inflammation AGPAT2 deficient adipocytes may have altered fat deposition or reduced ability to remodel massive fat availability associated with postnatal feeding.",

Zebrafish showed similar increased level of cellular oxidative stress leading to apoptosis and cell death as seen in patient cells but clinical phenotypes of AK2-deficiency are not recapitulated in zebrafish. Further analysis, in PMID: 31727854, showed that zebrafish ak2 is expressed in inner ear and neuromast structures and its deficiency severely affects the survival of hair cells in those structures through an increased level of oxidative stress and cell death, consistent with the hearing loss seen in patients.",

In the absence of AK2 expression, the export of high-energy phosphate compounds from the mitochondrion is impaired.

Hence, these results highlight the close relationship between energy balance and cell differentiation and thus show how the impairment of mitochondrial metabolism can result in a profound immunodeficiency.",

In humans, defects in bile acid synthesis can lead to metabolic disorders, similar to the findings in Akr1d1-/- mice. The sex-specific metabolic responses observed in the mice, such as differences in insulin tolerance and fat accumulation, may also reflect similar variations seen in human populations.

Co-transfection of cells with ALS2 induced a significant (3.3-fold) increase in the amount of Rac1 pulled down by GST-PBD bait. And in vitro PAK1 assays from CHO cells co-transfected with PAK1 \u00b1 ALS2 revealed that ALS2 stimulated PAK1 activity.\nFurthermore the DH/PH GEF domain is essential for this signaling because its disruption abrogates the effect on both Rac1 and PAK1 activities and on the ability of ALS2 to promote neurite outgrowth.",

The inhibition of ANKRD26 expression led to the rescue of the profound defect in proplatelet formation (the proposed origin of the thrombocytopenia). To understand how the preserved expression of the ANKRD26 gene could alter PPT formation through a signaling defect, the authors focused on the activation of JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K in response to TPO. Activation of the 3 signaling pathways was increased in MKs of patients compared with MKs of controls. They further demonstrated that RK1/2 activation at late stages of MK differentiation inhibits PPT formation through overexpression of a dominant-negative (DNMEK1) or active (MEKa) form of MEK1 in primary MKs and showed that DNMEK1 leads to a 2-fold increase in the percentage of PPT-bearing MKs while MEKa leads to a decrease.",

          "explanation": "The phenotypic spectrum of left-right asymmetry randomization, CHD and cystic kidney malformations represents a characteristic syndrome of perturbed IC-mediated signaling, exemplified here by the Roc and Streaker mutant mice, and consistent with findings in the inv/inv mouse and the NPHP3 and Nek8 knockout mouse models5,6,7. It is phenotypically distinct from other ciliopathy syndromes, including the Joubert-syndrome related disorders, Meckel-Gruber syndrome or Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and the lack of reported neural tube closure and CNS patterning defects, retinitis pigmentosa or obesity suggests that the IC regulates a different and very specific set of ciliary functions. We note IC disruption having not been directly implicated in motile ciliary dysfunction. Notably, previous work in the inv/inv mouse demonstrated normal nodal ciliary motility but a defective nodal flow pattern22. At that time, an abnormally shaped node was hypothesized as the origin of the defective flow and heterotaxy, but more recently proposed models may justify revisiting nodal flow and signaling in the inv/inv mouse23",

It also restored the ability to properly form a spheroid cyst with a central lumen in 3D culture (Fig. 5A). Finally, the observed epithelial barrier defects (trans-epithelial electrical resistance and permeability to dextran) were restored to wt levels (Fig. 5C, D).",

They first generated an AP1S1-KO line using CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig.  2A). Confocal microscopy and IHC-staining demonstrated that overall polarity was not affected in cell monolayers (Fig. 2C-D, 3A). However, the tight-junction protein ZO-1 aberrantly accumulated a cell-cell contact sites, and was mislocalized basally (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained for the enterocyte-specific tight-junction marker claudin 3 (Fig. 4A-B). Steady-state expression levels were unaffected for both proteins (Fig. 4C). Trans-epithelial electrical resistance was measured with a patch-clamp electrode; this value was reduced in KO cells compared to controls, indicative of a free flow of ions between the apical and basal surface (Fig. 5C). Finally, they added fluorescently labeled dextran to the culture medium and scored for fluorescence in the basal compartment after ten hours exposure. KO cells showed significantly higher levels of fluorescence, a further indicator of epithelial barrier permeability. These phenotypes are consistent with the enteropathy and chronic, intractable diarrhea phenotypes observed in MEDNIK patients.",

All patients received drug in a 24-week follow-on open-label extension period.37\nFor the placebo-controlled portion of the study (weeks 1\u201324), the 19 patients who were receiving galsulfase (galsulfase group) showed a significantly greater improvement in the 12MWT than was observed in the 20 patients who were receiving a placebo (placebo group). For the 3MSC, those in the galsulfase group also demonstrated greater improvement after 24 weeks than was observed in those in the placebo group.

Biochemical and immunocytochemical studies revealed that aspartoacylase is localized to white matter, and NAA concentration is threefold higher in gray matter than in white matter. Evidence indicated that aspartoacylase is conserved across species suggesting a significant role for aspartoacylase and N-acetylaspartic acid in normal brain biology.\nThe function of aspartocylase in the breakdown of NAA is consistent with the funding of elevated NAA in the urine and brain of individuals with Canavan disease.",

Hence, these results are included here, under Biochemical Evidence.\nThe authors showed that ASPA is exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes and that these cells are at the root of Canavan disease pathology. Transgenic mice with extra copies of the Nat8l gene (involved in NAA synthesis), under the neuronal Thy-1 promoter and in the Aspa WT background (ThyNAT mice), did not show signs of neurotoxicity even though they had higher NAA levels in the cortex than ASPA knock out mice. In these mice, NAA accumulation does not occur in oligodendrocytes due to normal ASPA function. Therefore, elevated NAA in the brain alone does not appear to be responsible for disease pathology. Rather, NAA toxicity appears to depend on the lack of its degradation in oligodendocytes. This indicated that the normal ASPA activity in the oligodendrocytes of ThyNAT mice was able to keep oligodendrocyte NAA at normal concentrations, preventing disease.\nDeletion of the Aspa gene exclusively in oligodendrocytes triggered a Canavan disease-like pathology, with delayed progression and partially attenuated late-stage severity. The authors conclude that deficiency of ASPA, which causes a detrimental increase NAA in oligodendrocytes, is the root cause for Canavan disease pathology.",

Knockout mice were treated by direct multi-site intracranial injections. Immunoblotting and qRT-PCR showed stable and abundant expression of transgenic ASPA in the CNS of treated mice. Five months after intracranial Mbp-ASPA gene therapy, T2-weighted MRI revealed that key aspects of the CD histopathology were reverted in AKO-GT mice. In vivo 1H-MR spectroscopy in the thalamus showed normalization of the metabolic profile. Brain volume and excessive ventricle dilation was normalized in treated mice. There was normalization of NAA and NAAG concentrations, as well as other metabolites and replenishment of the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter pools. Neurochemical restoration in GT mice was supported by attenuation of brain damage. Compared to AAV-GFP controls, in ASPA-KO mice mice treated with AAV-ASPA, numbers of neurons and oligodendrocytes were restored in the thalamus. Immunohistochemistry studies showed absence of reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis in AAV-ASPA treated mice, as well as improved myelination.
