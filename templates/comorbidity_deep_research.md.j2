# Comorbidity Deep Research Template

## Target Pair
- **Disease A:** {{ disease_a_label }}{% if disease_a_slug %} (slug: {{ disease_a_slug }}){% endif %}
- **Disease B:** {{ disease_b_label }}{% if disease_b_slug %} (slug: {{ disease_b_slug }}){% endif %}
{% if disease_b_composition %}- **Disease B Composition:** {{ disease_b_composition }}{% endif %}
{% if disease_b_components %}- **Disease B Components:** {{ disease_b_components }}{% endif %}

## Research Objectives

Provide a comprehensive research report on **comorbidity between Disease A and Disease B**.
Focus on both **statistical association** and **mechanistic hypotheses**.

### Required Information

#### 1) Evidence for Association
- Identify cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, or registry/EHR studies.
- Extract **effect measures**: OR, AOR, RR, HR, prevalence, incidence, IRR, CI, p-values.
- Note study population, sample size, geographic region, and timeframe.
- Specify **directionality/temporality** if available (A→B, B→A, same-time).

#### 2) Contradictory or Null Evidence
- Look for studies that do **not** support an association.
- Highlight discordant findings or negative results.

#### 3) Mechanistic Hypotheses
- Summarize proposed biological mechanisms linking A and B.
- Note neuroimmune, metabolic, vascular, endocrine, or other plausible pathways.
- Include any shared molecular signatures, cytokines, cell types, or pathways.

#### 4) Confounders and Bias
- Identify plausible confounders (e.g., age, BMI, smoking, medication effects).
- Note any adjustment strategies used in the literature.

#### 5) Mapping and Ontology Notes
- If ICD/OMOP/SNOMED codes are used, record how they map to Disease A/B concepts.
- Note if evidence pertains to a **component** of a composite Disease B.

### Citation Requirements

- Use primary literature (PMID preferred).
- Include **verbatim quotes** to support statistical claims.
- Cite reviews for mechanistic hypotheses and mark them as such.

### Output Format

Provide:
- A short narrative summary (3–8 paragraphs).
- A bullet list of statistical evidence items (each with PMID, metric, CI, and population).
- A bullet list of mechanistic hypotheses (each with PMIDs).
- A bullet list of contradictory/null findings (if any).
