# Mechanism Module Research Template

## Target Module
- **Module Name:** {module_name}
- **Module Slug:** {module_slug}
- **Category:** {category}

## Current Module Description

{module_description}

## Current Provisional Nodes

{pathophysiology_summary}

## Research Objective

Prepare a mechanism-focused research report for the dismech module above. This
is not a disease entry. The goal is to support a reusable mechanism module that
multiple gene-axis disease entries can conform to.

Focus the search on the shared biology described in the module description and
provisional nodes above. Prioritize evidence for:

- The conserved causal chain represented by the proposed nodes.
- The biological distinctions between node subgroups, especially if the module
  defines branching pathways.
- Any optional or gene-specific branches described in the node list, while
  distinguishing them from core module requirements.
- Explicit exclusions or boundary conditions stated in the module description.

## Questions To Answer

1. What is the best-supported shared mechanism for this module?
2. Is the current module name and scope appropriate, or is a clearer name or
   narrower boundary supported by the literature?
3. Which nodes should be core and required for conformance, and which nodes
   should be optional or gene-specific?
4. Which genes, variants, exposures, cell types, tissues, or molecular
   processes support each branch or node?
5. What evidence supports the causal edges between upstream drivers, central
   effectors, and downstream consequences?
6. What direct human evidence links the same causal factor or variant class to
   multiple clinical or pathological manifestations?
7. What model organism, in vitro, or other experimental evidence clarifies the
   causal path from molecular perturbation to phenotype?
8. What Gene Ontology biological process terms, Cell Ontology cell types, and
   anatomical terms should be used in the module?
9. What claims are speculative, weakly supported, or should remain out of scope?

## Evidence Requirements

- Cite primary literature with PMID identifiers whenever possible.
- Include exact abstract quotes for candidate evidence snippets.
- Separate human clinical, model organism, in vitro, and review evidence.
- Flag papers where the abstract is insufficient and full-text verification is
  needed before curation.
- Do not invent ontology IDs. Suggest terms by label when unsure.

## Desired Output

Structure the report with:

- Executive recommendation for module name and scope.
- Proposed DAG nodes and causal edges.
- Gene-to-node mapping table.
- Evidence table with PMID, evidence type, exact quote, and supported claim.
- Ontology suggestions for GO, CL, and UBERON terms.
- Out-of-scope boundary notes.
- Open questions for curator review.
