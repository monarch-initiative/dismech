    "description": "22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a chromosomal microdeletion disorder caused by hemizygous deletion of 1.5-3 Mb at chromosome 22q11.2. It is the most common microdeletion syndrome, occurring in approximately 1:4000 live births. The phenotype is highly variable but classically includes conotruncal cardiac defects, thymic hypoplasia with T-cell immunodeficiency, hypocalcemia from parathyroid hypoplasia, and characteristic facial features. The deleted region contains TBX1, haploinsufficiency of which disrupts pharyngeal arch and cardiac neural crest development.\n",

ATLL is endemic in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, parts of South America, and sub-Saharan Africa.

Aflatoxin exposure synergizes dramatically with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, increasing HCC risk approximately 60-fold compared to either factor alone. The molecular signature of aflatoxin-related HCC is the TP53 R249S mutation, resulting from AFB1-DNA adduct formation at codon 249. This disease exemplifies gene-environment interaction in cancer etiology and is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia where both aflatoxin exposure and HBV infection are endemic.",

PAX7-FOXO1 from t(1;13)(p36;q14) occurs in about 22% of cases with somewhat better outcomes. Approximately 20% are fusion-negative and behave more like embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.

    "description": "Arsenic poisoning (arsenicosis) is a toxic condition caused by acute or chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic, a metalloid found naturally in groundwater and soil and encountered through contaminated drinking water, occupational sources (mining, smelting, pesticide manufacturing), and certain traditional medicines. Acute arsenic ingestion causes severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage, cardiovascular collapse, and multi-organ failure. Chronic exposure produces a characteristic constellation of dermatological changes (hyperpigmentation, keratoses), peripheral neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, and increased cancer risk. Arsenic disrupts cellular function through inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase and other sulfhydryl- dependent enzymes, uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation by substituting for phosphate (arsenolysis), and generating reactive oxygen species. Endemic arsenicosis affects tens of millions in Bangladesh, West Bengal, and other regions with naturally high groundwater arsenic. Treatment of acute poisoning relies on chelation therapy with dimercaprol (BAL) or succimer (DMSA), while chronic arsenicosis management focuses on exposure cessation and symptomatic care.",

The disease has incomplete penetrance (66%) and variable expressivity. Clinical features include increased skeletal density, recurrent fractures, osteomyelitis (particularly mandibular), and cranial nerve compression causing visual loss. CLCN7 mutations also cause autosomal recessive osteopetrosis when homozygous, establishing ADO2 as allelic with a subset of infantile malignant osteopetrosis.\n",

This mutation occurs in approximately 40-60% of papillary thyroid carcinomas and is associated with aggressive clinicopathological features including extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, and radioiodine refractoriness. The identification of BRAF V600E as a driver oncogene led to development of targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib) in combination with MEK inhibitors (trametinib) for radioiodine-refractory disease, providing effective options beyond traditional cytotoxic therapy.",

Major causative bacteria include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Listeria monocytogenes. Pathogenesis involves bacterial entry through the blood-brain barrier or blood-CSF barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis or paracellular disruption, followed by activation of pattern recognition receptors (TLR2/TLR4), inflammasome activation, and breakdown of tight junctions. Clinical manifestations include headache, fever, neck stiffness, altered mental status, and in severe cases, seizures and focal neurological deficits.

    "description": "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common human malignancy, arising from basal cells of the epidermis and hair follicles. The majority of BCCs are driven by aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, most commonly through loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1 (the Hedgehog receptor that normally inhibits Smoothened) or less frequently through activating mutations in SMO (Smoothened). UV radiation is the primary environmental risk factor, with BCCs occurring predominantly on sun-exposed skin. While locally invasive and destructive, BCC rarely metastasizes. Surgical excision is curative for most BCCs, but advanced or metastatic disease can be treated with Hedgehog pathway inhibitors such as vismodegib and sonidegib.",

Acute inhalation of cadmium fumes causes severe pneumonitis and acute lung injury. Chronic exposure leads to progressive renal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome), hypophosphataemic osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and peripheral neuropathy. The most severe form of chronic cadmium toxicity is itai-itai disease, endemic in cadmium-polluted regions of Japan, characterized by severe bone pain, fractures, and renal failure. Cadmium has a long biological half-life (10-30 years) and there is no effective antidote; management centers on exposure cessation, chelation therapy, and supportive care.",

It is characterized histopathologically by central cores \u2014 areas of sarcomeric disorganization and mitochondrial depletion running along the longitudinal axis of type 1 muscle fibers. Clinical features include proximal muscle weakness, hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, orthopaedic complications, and susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. Inheritance is most commonly autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, though autosomal recessive forms exist and tend to be more severe.

The EWSR1-ATF1 fusion activates MITF, the master regulator of melanocyte development, explaining the melanocytic phenotype.

Nearly 2,000 CFTR variants have been identified, with the Phe508del (F508del) mutation present in nearly 90% of patients. The disease is characterized by progressive bronchiectasis, chronic bacterial lung infection, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, male infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, and elevated sweat chloride. Multidisciplinary care and CFTR modulator therapies have extended median survival beyond 40 years, with the advent of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (Trikafta) representing a transformational advance for the majority of patients.",

The disease primarily manifests as the triad of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and intellectual disability in affected males. Female carriers may develop milder cardiac manifestations later in life due to X-chromosome inactivation mosaicism. The prognosis is poor in males, with rapid progression towards heart failure, and only heart transplantation modifies the disease course.\n",

It is commonly reported worldwide in association with gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and flatulence, though its pathogenicity remains debated. Transmission is thought to occur via the fecal-oral route, possibly facilitated by helminth eggs such as those of Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm). Clinical outcomes range from asymptomatic carriage to chronic gastrointestinal illness.",

EBV-positive gastric cancers comprise approximately 9% of all gastric cancers worldwide and show unique features including prominent lymphoid infiltration, better prognosis than other subtypes, and potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

It is characterized by disproportionate short-limb short stature, postaxial polydactyly, ectodermal dysplasia (including nail and dental anomalies), and congenital heart defects (most commonly a common atrium or single atrium). The syndrome has a notably high prevalence in the Old Order Amish population due to a founder effect.\n",

ERMS is characterized by loss of heterozygosity at 11p15, the locus containing IGF2 and other imprinted genes. Unlike alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, ERMS lacks characteristic fusion genes and instead harbors a variety of mutations in RAS pathway genes. ERMS generally has a better prognosis than fusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, with 5-year survival rates exceeding 70% for localized disease.",

Driver mutations include JAK2 V617F (approximately 55%), CALR (25%), and MPL (3%), with 15% being triple-negative. ET has the most indolent course among classic myeloproliferative neoplasms with near-normal life expectancy in younger patients, though it carries risks of thrombosis, hemorrhage, and transformation to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. Treatment focuses on thrombosis prevention with aspirin and cytoreduction in high-risk patients using hydroxyurea, anagrelide, or interferon.",

It is characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum, with virtually 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer if untreated. FAP exemplifies the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway dysregulation in colorectal tumorigenesis. Extracolonic manifestations include desmoid tumors, duodenal adenomas, osteomas (Gardner syndrome), and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE).",

Between 21 and 22 complementation groups are cited depending on nomenclature and curation conventions, with FANCA accounting for 60-70% of cases. The phenotypic spectrum is highly variable even within the same complementation group, reflecting genetic modifiers and environmental factors.",

Under WHO 2021 classification, this molecularly defined entity requires absence of IDH1/2 mutations and presence of at least one of three molecular features: TERT promoter mutation, EGFR amplification, or combined gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10 (+7/-10). These tumors are characterized by rapid growth, extensive infiltration, florid microvascular proliferation, and necrosis. Despite multimodal therapy, prognosis remains poor with median survival of 14-16 months. Key molecular alterations include TERT promoter mutations (80%), EGFR amplification (40-50%), PTEN loss, and homozygous CDKN2A deletion.",

GLI3 normally functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor in Hedgehog signaling; GCPS results from loss of total GLI3 protein through large deletions, translocations, or various intragenic mutations, in contrast to the allelic disorder Pallister-Hall syndrome which results from truncating mutations that produce a constitutive repressor.\n",

The enzyme localizes to the ER membrane with its catalytic domain in the ER lumen and contains a unique EF-hand domain suggesting calcium regulation of enzymatic activity. Loss of P4H-TM leads to dysregulated HIF-1 signaling and calcium dynamics in astrocytes, affecting gliotransmission and central respiratory control circuits.",

In the limb, TBX5 is critical for forelimb bud initiation and radial patterning in the lateral plate mesoderm.

PP2A opposes the activity of growth-promoting kinases of the PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK pathways. Core clinical features include neurodevelopmental delay (especially affecting language), prolonged hypotonia, high risk of seizures, behavioral problems, and variable head circumference abnormalities. Four subtypes are recognized based on the affected PP2A subunit gene: HJS type 1 (PPP2R5D), HJS type 2 (PPP2R1A), HJS type 3 (PPP2CA), and HJS type 4 (PPP2R5C).

Under the WHO 2021 classification, this molecularly defined entity encompasses tumors previously classified as diffuse astrocytoma (grade 2), anaplastic astrocytoma (grade 3), and astrocytic glioblastoma (grade 4). IDH mutations result in neomorphic enzyme activity producing D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite that inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, leading to global DNA hypermethylation (G-CIMP phenotype) and impaired cellular differentiation. Prognosis is significantly better than IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.",

IDH-mutant cholangiocarcinomas have distinct clinical features including younger age at onset and better prognosis compared to IDH wild-type tumors.

KIT signaling activates both MAPK and PI3K pathways, driving melanocyte proliferation and survival. KIT-mutant melanoma can be treated with imatinib and other KIT inhibitors, though responses are variable depending on mutation type, with exon 11 and 13 mutations showing better responses than amplification alone.",

    "description": "Kummell disease (also known as Kummell's disease or delayed post-traumatic vertebral collapse) is a condition characterized by avascular necrosis of a vertebral body following minor spinal trauma. First described by Hermann Kummell in 1891, the disease presents with an initial period of relatively minor symptoms after trauma, followed by a symptom-free interval, and then progressive painful kyphosis with vertebral body collapse. The hallmark radiographic finding is the intravertebral vacuum cleft sign, representing gas (nitrogen) accumulation within the necrotic vertebral body. The condition predominantly affects elderly patients with osteoporosis and most commonly involves the thoracolumbar junction. Treatment ranges from conservative management to vertebral augmentation procedures (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) and, in severe cases, surgical stabilization.\n",

In serous labyrinthitis, only toxins and inflammatory mediators cross the round window membrane without direct bacterial invasion, producing reversible dysfunction. In suppurative labyrinthitis, bacteria directly invade the perilymphatic space, causing severe purulent inflammation.\n",

LIAS catalyzes the insertion of sulfur atoms into octanoyl-GCSH to form lipoyl-GCSH, the second step in the mitochondrial lipoylation pathway. Loss of function impairs lipoylation of all lipoic acid-dependent enzyme complexes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, and the glycine cleavage system. The biochemical signature is identical to LIPT2 deficiency (NELABA), with lactic acidosis, hyperglycinemia, and combined dehydrogenase deficiency. Clinical features include neonatal-onset seizures, severe encephalopathy, hypotonia, and failure to thrive. Brain MRI shows cerebral atrophy and white matter abnormalities.\n",

    "description": "Lipoyl transferase 1 deficiency (OMIM 616299) is a rare autosomal recessive mitochondrial disorder caused by biallelic mutations in LIPT1, encoding lipoyltransferase 1. LIPT1 catalyzes the final step in the mitochondrial lipoylation pathway, transferring lipoyl groups from lipoyl-GCSH to the E2 subunits of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenases (pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase). Critically, LIPT1 deficiency spares the glycine cleavage system, as GCSH is lipoylated upstream by the LIPT2-LIAS pathway. This results in combined dehydrogenase deficiency with lactic acidosis but typically normal glycine levels, distinguishing it biochemically from LIPT2 and LIAS deficiency. Clinical presentation includes Leigh-like encephalopathy, seizures, dystonia, spastic tetraparesis, and variable hepatic involvement. Onset is neonatal to early infantile. Metabolic decompensation during febrile illness may precipitate acute neurological deterioration.\n",

Additional features include craniosynostosis, skeletal abnormalities (scoliosis, pectus deformity, joint laxity or contractures), thin translucent skin, and immunologic features (food allergy, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease). LDS carries a high risk of aortic dissection at smaller aortic diameters than Marfan syndrome, with a mean age at death of 26.0 years in initial cohorts. Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical management are critical.\n",

MCC is highly aggressive with significant metastatic potential, but also immunogenic. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (avelumab, pembrolizumab) have transformed treatment of advanced MCC, with response rates of 50-70% and durable responses in many patients.",

Additional features include endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, hyperparathyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities. The syndrome predominantly affects postmenopausal women, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 9:1. The etiology remains incompletely understood but is thought to involve endocrine imbalance driven by genetic and environmental factors, with prolonged estrogen exposure, elevated leptin levels, and growth hormone dysregulation implicated in the pathogenesis of the skull thickening.\n",

LIPT2 catalyzes the first committed step in the mitochondrial lipoylation pathway, transferring octanoyl groups from acyl carrier protein to the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH). Loss of function impairs lipoylation of all lipoic acid-dependent enzyme complexes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, and the glycine cleavage system. This causes congenital lactic acidosis, hyperglycinemia, severe encephalopathy with minimal psychomotor development, and progressive brain abnormalities including cortical atrophy, cysts, white matter abnormalities, and cortical malformations. Onset is at birth with hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency. Only four cases have been reported. Prognosis is poor; lipoic acid supplementation is ineffective.\n",

    "description": "NRAS-mutant melanoma is a molecular subtype of cutaneous melanoma characterized by activating mutations in the NRAS oncogene, occurring in approximately 15-25% of cutaneous melanomas. The most common mutations affect codon 61 (Q61R, Q61K, Q61L), with codons 12 and 13 affected less frequently. NRAS mutations result in constitutive GTP-bound active state and persistent activation of both MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. NRAS-mutant melanomas are associated with chronic sun damage, older patient age, thicker primary tumors, and poorer prognosis compared to BRAF-mutant disease. Unlike BRAF-mutant melanoma, direct RAS inhibition has proven challenging, though MEK inhibitors show some activity and combination strategies are under investigation.",

NTRK fusions occur at varying frequencies: very common in secretory breast carcinoma and infantile fibrosarcoma (>90%), but rare (<1%) in common solid tumors.

It is characterized by cafe-au-lait macules, neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, skeletal abnormalities, and increased risk of malignancy including optic pathway gliomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). NF1 exemplifies the RASopathy spectrum, with neurofibromin functioning as a RAS-GAP that normally negatively regulates RAS-MAPK signaling.",

The constitutively active BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase drives leukemic transformation of B-lymphoid progenitors. Historically carrying a dismal prognosis, the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, ponatinib) to chemotherapy has transformed outcomes, with cure rates now approaching those of Ph-negative ALL when combined with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

    "description": "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. The autosomal dominant form (ADPKD) is one of the most common inherited kidney diseases, affecting approximately 1 in 500-1000 people. ADPKD is caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 genes and typically presents in adulthood with progressive renal enlargement, hypertension, and eventual kidney failure. Autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD) is less common and typically presents in infancy or childhood.\n",

The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in approximately 95% of PV cases, with JAK2 exon 12 mutations accounting for most remaining cases. This mutation causes constitutive activation of JAK-STAT signaling, driving erythropoietin-independent erythroid proliferation.

Driver mutations include JAK2 V617F (approximately 60%), CALR (25%), and MPL (5%), with 10% being triple-negative. Additional mutations in epigenetic regulators (ASXL1, TET2, EZH2) and splicing factors contribute to disease heterogeneity and prognosis. PMF causes marked splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and carries risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib and fedratinib provide symptom control, while allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative option.",

Cathepsin K is the major protease responsible for degradation of type I collagen in the bone matrix. In pycnodysostosis, osteoclasts can acidify the resorption lacuna normally but cannot degrade the organic bone matrix, leading to osteosclerosis and short stature. Characteristic features include increased bone density with pathologic fractures, open fontanelles and sutures, and short stature. The French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is believed to have had this condition.\n",

ROS1 fusions occur in approximately 1-2% of NSCLC and share clinical and molecular similarities with ALK-rearranged tumors. Like ALK, ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that becomes constitutively activated when fused to various partner genes. ROS1-positive NSCLC occurs predominantly in younger patients with minimal or no smoking history and responds to ALK/ROS1 inhibitors such as crizotinib, entrectinib, and lorlatinib.",

Primary Raynaud disease occurs without an underlying connective tissue disease and involves primarily functional vascular abnormalities. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is associated with autoimmune conditions such as systemic sclerosis and involves both functional and structural vascular changes. The pathogenesis involves dysregulated neurovascular control, endothelial dysfunction, alpha-2C adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction amplified by RhoA/ROCK signaling, and impaired nitric oxide-soluble guanylate cyclase-cGMP vasodilatory pathways.\n",

It represents an intermediate phenotype between achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia, with severe skeletal features but potential for survival beyond infancy. Key distinguishing features include the presence of acanthosis nigricans (hyperpigmented, velvety skin) and developmental delay/intellectual disability, which are not typical of other FGFR3 skeletal dysplasias. The condition demonstrates how different mutations at the same codon (K650) can produce distinct clinical phenotypes.\n",

    "description": "Scimitar syndrome (also known as pulmonary venolobar syndrome or hypogenetic lung syndrome) is a rare congenital cardiovascular malformation characterized by partial or complete anomalous pulmonary venous return from the right lung to the inferior vena cava, resulting in a left-to-right shunt. The syndrome's name derives from the characteristic curvilinear shadow on chest radiograph formed by the anomalous vein, resembling a Turkish curved sword (scimitar). The condition is frequently associated with right lung hypoplasia, dextroposition of the heart, anomalous systemic arterial supply to the right lower lobe from the aorta, and other cardiac defects including atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect. Presentation exhibits a clear bimodal pattern with either an infantile form characterized by heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and significant mortality, or a pediatric/adult form that is milder and may be asymptomatic on diagnosis. Treatment depends on symptom severity and hemodynamic significance, with surgical repair indicated for significant left-to-right shunting.\n",

    "description": "Sclerosteosis is an autosomal recessive progressive sclerosing bone dysplasia caused by loss-of-function mutations in the SOST gene, which encodes sclerostin, a secreted Wnt signaling antagonist. Loss of sclerostin leads to unopposed Wnt-mediated osteoblast activation and massive progressive bone formation throughout life. The condition is characterized by generalized hyperostosis and sclerosis of the skull, mandible, ribs, clavicles, and long bones, leading to cranial nerve compression. Hand malformations (syndactyly) and tall stature distinguish sclerosteosis from the closely related Van Buchem disease. The majority of affected individuals have been reported in the South African Afrikaner population due to a founder effect. Discovery of SOST led to development of anti-sclerostin antibodies (romosozumab) for osteoporosis.\n",

    "description": "Shigella uses a plasmid-encoded Type III secretion system (T3SS/mxi-spa) to deliver bacterial effector proteins directly into host cells. The translocon proteins IpaB and IpaC assemble a funnel-shaped pore in target membranes through which the injectisome docks and delivers effectors. IpaC activates small GTPases and actin nucleation to promote bacterial uptake. IpaB mediates phagosomal membrane disruption and directly activates caspase-1 in macrophages, triggering pyroptotic cell death. This allows bacterial escape from the phagolysosome into the cytosol, where Shigella replicates and spreads.\n",

Despite its name, synovial sarcoma does not arise from synovial tissue and the cell of origin remains uncertain. It typically affects adolescents and young adults, with peak incidence in the third decade. Common sites include the extremities, particularly around large joints, but it can occur anywhere including head, neck, and trunk. The SS18-SSX fusion disrupts chromatin remodeling through interaction with the SWI/SNF complex, leading to epigenetic reprogramming that drives oncogenesis.",

RBM10 normally promotes cassette exon skipping through interaction with U2 snRNP at intron branch sites on chromatin. Loss of RBM10 function shifts hundreds to thousands of splicing events toward exon inclusion. Key downstream effects include NOTCH pathway de-repression via NUMB missplicing and dysregulation of extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal signaling through isoform changes in VCL, CD44, and TNC. These splicing defects disrupt developmental pathways controlling craniofacial morphogenesis, limb patterning, and cardiac development, leading to the characteristic TARP phenotype.",

    "description": "Temple-Baraitser syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in KCNH1, which encodes the EAG1 voltage-gated potassium channel. The syndrome is characterized by severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and distinctive limb anomalies including hypoplasia or aplasia of the thumbnails and great-toe nails with broadening and elongation of the thumbs and halluces. Additional features include characteristic facial dysmorphism with wide mouth and thick vermilion borders, developmental delays, and variable craniofacial abnormalities. Most cases arise from de novo mutations, though maternal mosaicism has been reported. The condition represents part of a spectrum that may overlap with Zimmermann-Laband syndrome.\n",

Uveal melanoma has a propensity for hepatic metastasis, with approximately 50% of patients eventually developing liver metastases despite successful treatment of the primary tumor.

Unlike sclerosteosis, where SOST coding mutations abolish sclerostin, Van Buchem disease results from deletion of a distant bone-specific enhancer element (ECR5) that is required for SOST transcription in osteocytes. The deletion leads to downregulation of sclerostin expression, producing a similar but generally milder phenotype than sclerosteosis. Van Buchem disease lacks the hand malformations and tall stature seen in sclerosteosis. This was one of the first examples of a human disease caused by deletion of a distant regulatory element rather than a coding mutation.\n",
